\chapter{Binary branching, locality, and recursion}

This chapter discusses three points: section~\ref{sec-branching} deals with the question of whether all
linguistic structures should be binary branching or not. Section~\ref{sec-locality} discusses the
question what information should be available for selection, that is, whether governing heads can
access the internal structure of selected elements or whether everything should be restricted to
local selection. Finally, Section~\ref{sec-recursion} discusses recursion and how/whether it is
captured in the different grammar theories that are discussed in this book.
