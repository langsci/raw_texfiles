\section*{Available versions of this book}

The canonical version of this book is the PDF document available from the Language Science Press
webpage of this book\footnote{%
\url{\lsURL}
}. This page also links to a Print on Demand version. Since the book is very long, we decided to
split the book into two volumes. The first volume contains the description of all theories and the
second volume contains the general discussion. Both volumes contain the complete list of references
and the indices. The second volume starts with page~\pageref{part-discussion}. The printed volumes
are therefore identical to the parts of the PDF document.
