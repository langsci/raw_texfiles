This is a version of what happened in the Tipije valley as Mr. Gohoupe's parents experienced it. The storytelling lapses back and forth at certain moments, and most of the participants are not formally introduced. This is due, apart from Mr. Gohoupe's age, to the audience: they all grew up in the area and know the story. Briefly summarized, first Kafeyat Cidopwaan, chief of Ouen Kout/Wan Kuut, was blamed for the attacks on settler households (see \chapref{chap:Tipije}), and when the European soldiers stationed in Dewanwe conducted punitive expeditions, he was shot in the back near Tendo; he died in a creek there. All men were assembled and either killed in the process or sent to Nouméa to be questioned. The women were sent to Houaïlou. At the same time, the colonial authorities looked for the chiefs responsible for the war, and as the mother of chief Kafeyat could show a black shell money, used to broker war alliances, and as she said that the chief of Hienghène, Bwaarat, had sent it to call his allies to war, the blame shifted onto Bwaarat. He hanged himself when he heard that a ship had come to take him to the guillotine. The men and women were then released from prison.\largerpage[2]
