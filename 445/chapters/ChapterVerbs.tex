\is{Verbs}

Verbs are the biggest word class in Vamale after nouns. They make up over a third of the recorded lexicon (1314/3627), with nouns numbering 1844 (counting proper nouns and common deverbal nominalizations). In Vamale, apart from predication, verbs may modify nouns (covered in \sectref{sec:ModNoun}) and verbs alike (\sectref{ssec:CompV}, \sectref{sec:SVC}, and \sectref{ssec:MannerV}), though adverbs exist as well (\sectref{sec:Adv}). Intransitive verbs can form clauses on their own. Verbs can be divided into three main classes, according to their subject-indexing morphology. Active verbs, which bear subject-indexing on their left (see \sectref{sec:ActV}), mark transitive subjects like agent-like intransitive subjects, compare examples (\ref{ex:itr}) and (\ref{ex:an}) (\Cref{fig:alignment}). Stative verbs, described in \sectref{sec:StatV}, take suffixes for subject-indexing (\ref{ex:stat}) and use morphemes distinct from undergoer-indexing suffixes, shown in \Cref{tab:markers2}. Verbs usually index the subject, except in imperative constructions, in serial verb constructions if they are not the first verb, and, for stative verbs, if the subject is inanimate. The argument markers can be omitted for pragmatic reasons, most prominently in lists of things happening, or when it is otherwise clear to whom something happens, as in (\ref{ex:same-subject}).

\ea \label{ex:same-subject}\gll ka cahma yo, tha gavwe=paa hmaa-koo-ng naen, gavwe=bwa hmaa-koo-ng, ka pala\\
 \gl{cnj} \gl{top} 1\gl{sg} \gl{ass} 2\gl{pl}=\gl{prf} hit-on-1\gl{sg} now 2\gl{pl}=\gl{ipfv} hit-on-1\gl{sg} \gl{cnj} talk\\
\glt \qu{But me, you have found me now, you found me and [we] spoke.} {[HC19:59]}
\z

Another type is impersonal verbs, which take a subordinate clause as their sole argument, and cannot take a subject (\sectref{sec:ZeroTrans}). One type of verb is described in \chapref{ChapterVP} instead of here: manner verbs are bound intransitive verbs that only occur as elements modifying the head verb (\sectref{ssec:MannerV}).

\section{Impersonal verbs}
\label{sec:ZeroTrans}
\is{Verbs!Impersonal verbs}
Impersonal verbs, a term used by \textcite[70]{rivierre_langue_1980} for Cèmuhî, do not take argument indices and cannot occur in the imperative mood, but like other verbs they can form complete clauses by themselves and can either occur with an argument or without it. One subset of impersonal verbs, the affirmative existential \textit{vwa} and the negative existential \textit{cika}, can only take a noun phrase as an argument, but these are not the subject, as evidenced by their inability to take \textit{ka} \qu{\gl{sbj}}. This excludes pronouns. Since Vamale does not have a word for \qu{to have}, having or not having something is expressed with possessive constructions, as in (\ref{ex:vwa_have}): e.g. \qu{there is for me}, calqued into local French: \textit{Il y a une femme pour toi?} \qu{Is there a wife for you?} meaning \qu{Do you have a wife?} \textit{Cika} \qu{\gl{neg}.\gl{exist}} only takes inanimate and non-specific animate arguments, while \textit{cia-} is open to arguments of any animacy, and generic inanimates. \textit{Vwa} \qu{\gl{exist}} may exceptionally take free pronouns and specific animate arguments in marked scenarios (persons will usually be localized with \textit{la} \qu{be here} and demonstratives).

\ea \label{ex:vwa_have}\gll hê tha vwa li=xhaohmu vwa wadala-le\\

\glt \qu{Yes, there were elders who had guns.} {[KL:141]} 
\z

Another subset of impersonal verbs takes a complement clause as their sole argument (\ref{ex:impV1}), but can also stand alone (\ref{ex:impV2}). They form a small, closed class, partly derived from nouns. \textit{Goon ma} \qu{allowed, possible to}, \textit{vwasoon ma} \qu{impossible to},\footnote{Maybe from \textit{vwa-s(it)oon} \qu{\gl{exist}-taboo}.} \textit{siteke ma} \qu{forbidden to} work like this (see \Cref{fig:VwaTree}). 
Most members of this class have other meanings when used as nouns or verbs in other contexts, e.g. \textit{goon} \qu{body, enough} but \textit{goon, ma\ldots} \qu{possible, feasible, allowed to\ldots.}

\textit{Uta} \qu{rain}, \textit{mapeke} \qu{be day}, \textit{bwen} \qu{night} and other members of the lexical field of weather phenomena, sea tide, etc. exist as article-bearing nouns as well, do not take arguments, but can form clauses and take certain adverbs. This third group is called verbs on the basis of constructions where the members cannot behave like typical nouns (\ref{ex:uta}), and following analyses of cognates in other languages, where the forms can be derived to take arguments: \textit{bwen-i-ɛg} \qu{It becomes night around me} \parencite[302]{rivierre_langue_1980}. This argument-taking is not attested in Vamale (anymore), but oblique constructions still exist.

%\textit{Vwasoon} and \textit{goon} need a subordinator afterwards, which seems to be a clue that they do not take arguments. They are probably derived from nouns. \textit{goo-n xat} \qu{midday} looks like a classic possessive construction, literally \qu{enough sun} in the modern language, maybe \qu{maximal sun} before, because \textit{goon} is mostly used for \qu{enough, no more!} as a threat or plea, if it does not occur in the formula \textit{goon ma X...} \qu{it is possible/good...} (asking for permission or asking somebody to do something). \textit{Goon} also means \qu{body}. In the same sense, considering that the first syllable in \textit{vwasoon} \qu{impossible} only ever occurs as the morpheme \textit{vwa} \qu{exist; do}, this may be an old VP, lexicalized but still, following the "there is X" pattern, needless of arguments.
%\textit{Cika} \qu{\gl{neg}.\gl{exist}} is the same class as \textit{vwa} \qu{\gl{exist}}. They both take an argument, which can be implied if already mentioned.

 \section{Stative verbs}
\label{sec:StatV}
\is{Verbs!Stative verbs}

``Stative verbs" are a classic feature in New Caledonian languages, already described in \textcite{haudricourt_langues_1948}, and descend from Proto-Oceanic \parencite[63]{lynch_oceanic_2002}.\footnote{\citeauthor{lynch_oceanic_2002} distinguish stative and dynamic verbs, while the French tradition, and this study, call the latter ``active" verbs.} They are inflected with morphemes that closely resemble postponed free forms, as in \tabref{tab:hmet}. Like the undergoers of transitive verbs, the animacy of the referent decides whether the subject of a stative verb is marked: inanimate participants are not indexed on the verb.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Inflection of \textit{hmet-} \qu{sated}}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		\lsptoprule
\gl{sg} & 1 &\textit{hmet-eo}\\
		&2& \textit{hmet-go}\\
		&3& \textit{hmet-ea}\\
		\midrule
\gl{du} & 1\gl{incl}& \textit{hmet-gasu}\\
		&1\gl{excl}&\textit{hmet-abu}\\
		&2&\textit{hmet-au}\\
		&3& \textit{hmet-lu}\\
		\midrule
\gl{pl} & 1\gl{incl}& \textit{hmet-gaa}\\
		&1\gl{excl} & \textit{hmet-abe}\\
		&2 & \textit{hmet-gavwe}\\
		&3 & \textit{hmet-le}\\
		\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:hmet}
\end{table}

Stative verbs are a closed class, semantically vaguely characterized by a patientive S (though many active verbs also have a patientive S, e.g. \textit{weke} \qu{to be angry}, or \textit{khûda} \qu{to stink}). The argument is marked in the same position as transitive undergoers, and shares the latter's form, except in the first and second persons, where P arguments have a devoiced form, i.e. \textit{-ko} \qu{2\gl{sg}}, \textit{-kaa} \qu{1\gl{pl}.\gl{incl}} etc. This means that S is marked in two ways: S and A are marked the same for active verbs, and stative verb S subjects are either marked the same as P, or slightly differently, depending on the speaker and the verb. We thus have a tripartite system, though stative S and P are merged by many younger speakers, yielding a split-intransitive system like in western Voh-Koné. Diachronically, stative S and P participants were probably expressed as free pronouns following the predicate (V PN),\footnote{This may be linked to a Proto-Oceanic VSO or VOS word order \parencite[86, 87]{lynch_oceanic_2002}, though nowadays SVO is more widespread and considered canonic \parencite[49]{lynch_oceanic_2002}. Note that this would not explain the indexing found on active verbs.} which became incorporated into the verb (e.g. \textit{hmwet ia} \qu{tired 3\gl{sg}} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hmwet-ea}). Indirect possession underwent a similar process (\textit{thala-n ia} \qu{knife-\gl{poss} 3\gl{sg}} $\rightarrow$ \textit{thala n-ea}). 
The stative verb \textit{hmana-n} \qu{be hungry} (not a noun because it cannot take an article) has the paradigm of a directly possessed noun, and shares this property with \textit{muliva-n} \qu{be alive} (see \sectref{ssec:PossV}).

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \textit{yamaan}\qu{be not motivated} 
%	\item \textit{saxhwe} \qu{refuse to eat} is actually just stative
%	\item \textit{sahnaang} \qu{not understand} is also just stative
%\end{itemize}


\subsection{Dependent stative verbs}
\label{ssec:Verbs_n}
\is{Verbs!Stative verbs!Dependent stative verbs}
Some verbs, active as well as stative ones, show nominal inflection. This grammar will use the term \textsc{dependent verb} found in some New Caledonian descriptions \parencite[207]{ozanne-rivierre_iaai_1976} for these verbs that can index a non-specific argument with a generic \textit{-n} (similarly to inalienably possessed nouns, called \textsc{dependent nouns} in the French tradition, which also cannot omit marking their modifier). Active verbs with nominal morphology work rather differently and are discussed in \sectref{ssec:active-n}. The verbs described here take different subject-indexing suffixes depending on animacy and specificity of the subject, as shown in \Cref{tab:V-n}. There are few still productive verbs in this category, but they are frequently used. Common members include \textit{xhopwe-n} \qu{grow/be big}, \textit{xhwati-n} \qu{be small}, \textit{hmai-n} \qu{be many}, \textit{sate-n} \qu{be different}, \textit{yape-n} \qu{be old (inanimate)}. % This section will use \textit{xhopwe} as an example.%, \textit{e-n} \qu{be first}. 


Animate subjects are indexed on stative verbs with personal suffixes (\textit{-eo} \qu{1\gl{sg}}, \textit{-go} \qu{2\gl{sg}} etc.) when they are not present as a noun phrase (\ref{ex:Vn1}). Inanimate subjects take \textit{-n} \qu{\gl{ana}} in these cases (\ref{ex:Vn2}). %If the subject is expressed as an NP in the same clause, the stative verb does not carry a suffix for animate NPs (\ref{ex:VnbareAnim}), and definite inanimate NPs (\ref{ex:VnbareInanim}). 

\ea\label{ex:Vn1}
\gll sate-o\\
 different-1\gl{sg}\\
\glt \qu{I am different.}
\z


\ea\label{ex:Vn2}
\gll sate-n (koo-n)\\
 different-\gl{ana} (\gl{obl}-\gl{ana})\\
\glt \qu{It is different (from it).}
\z

Generic subjects are always marked with \textit{-n} \qu{\gl{nspec}} (\ref{ex:Vn}). These rules begin to be less rigidly enforced in Voh-Koné languages in general \parencite[51]{rivierre_bwatoo_2006}, and \textit{-n} now often appears before noun phrases regardless of their animacy and specificity (\ref{ex:xhopwen i-X}). This may have contributed to the development of noun phrase internal modifiying verbs (see \sectref{sec:adj}).
\ea\label{ex:Vn}\gll e=vi hapi na naen xadaa sate-n \\
 1\gl{sg}=say \gl{comp} \gl{dem} now on.the.other.hand different-\gl{nspec}\\
\glt \qu{I'm saying that now things have changed.} {[KL:243]}
\z

Some stative verbs have split into two forms with different meanings, e.g. \textit{hmwaka-n}, \textit{hmwaka-o} \qu{be like it, be like me}, but \textit{hmwakan} \qu{maybe}.
Verbs with nominal morphology can also be found in Cèmuhî \parencite[179, 183]{rivierre_langue_1980} and Nyelâyu \parencite[48]{ozanne-rivierre_nyelayu_1998}. They are not described as an open class in these grammars. Though most verbs with nominal morphology in Vamale are stative, there are also active ones. A prominent example is \textit{caihna-n} \qu{to know} (discussed in more detail \sectref{ssec:active-n}). Some stative verbs with \textit{-n} can be derived with \textit{-ke} \qu{\gl{tr}}, compare \textit{xhwatii-n} \qu{be small} and \textit{xhwatii-ke} \qu{do softly}.







\begin{table}
	\caption{Meanings of \textit{xhopwe-} \qu{grow}}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
	\lsptoprule

	\end{tabular}	
	\label{tab:V-n}
\end{table}

For \textit{xhopwe-n} \qu{big}, there is a meaning distinction along an animacy axis: without \textit{-n}, it expresses either a development \qu{big} $\rightarrow$ \qu{get bigger}, through time in comparison with an earlier state (\qu{grow}), or synchronically in comparison with others (\qu{be bigger than}, see example \ref{ex:VnAnim}). A table summarizes the forms (\Cref{tab:V-n}). \textit{xhopwe-} means \qu{to be bigger} for animate subjects (\ref{ex:VnAnim}) and \qu{to be big} for inanimates (\ref{ex:xhopwen i-X}, \ref{ex:xhopwen}). %, if it is clear from the context that it is a momentary observation. %\textit{xhopwe-} means \qu{to grow, to be bigger} for all subjects (\ref{ex:VnbareInanim}, \ref{ex:xhopwen can}).

%\textit{xhopwen} in (\ref{ex:xhopwen i-X}) means \qu{its growth, its size}, and is derived from \qu{to grow}. Compare \textit{hun-xhopwen an}, literally \qu{his/her way of being/becoming big} means \qu{his/her corpulence}. % %todo{??? What is exactly derived from what here...?} 
%though
%Syntactically, \textit{xhopwen} is used similarly to \textit{joaka-n}, as shown in \Cref{tree:joakan}, .
A construction frequently seen with animate subjects is shown in (\ref{ex:xhopwen}). The unmarked use of \textit{xhopwe}, as explained above, is as a predicate with comparative meaning (\ref{ex:VnbareAnim}). In a relative clause, \textit{xhopwe} is ungrammatical without a resumptive subject-indexing suffix (\ref{ex:Vno}), e.g. \textit{-a}, or an anaphoric suffix \textit{-n} (\ref{ex:xhopwen can}). In example (\ref{ex:xhopwen}), however, the meaning of \textit{xhopwen} is not comparative. This construction seems to be a strategy to avoid the incremental\slash comparative meaning of certain stative verbs, and may be related to the de\hyp grammaticalization of \textit{-n} mentioned for \textit{xhopwen} in \Cref{tab:V-n}.

\subsection{Numerals}
\label{ssec:Numerals}
\is{Numerals}
\is{Verbs!Numerals}

Numerals in Vamale are stative verbs that can take subject suffixes, as \Cref{tab:numbers} shows. Some are derived from nouns, notably 5 from \qu{hand}\footnote{From \textit{si-} \qu{hand}, showing the tendency to rather speak of 2\gl{sg} or 1\gl{pl}.\gl{incl} than an indefinite 3\gl{sg}.} and 20 from \qu{person}, the bases of the system. Complex numerals used to be formed like clauses, made of coordinated verb phrases. 

%\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

 \textit{(N)a-bwa} was only recorded with complex numerals, some of which are shown in \Cref{tab:compo_numbers}. The initial nasal only occurs if the preceding element ends in an open syllable. Bwatoo has \textit{bwa} as \qu{+} \parencite[45]{rivierre_bwatoo_2006}, maybe related to \textit{pwa} \qu{on} or \textit{bwa}- \qu{head}. Leenhardt translates \textit{vajilu ka bwa nim ka bwa se} \qu{16}, then with \textit{ka} instead of \textit{na}, as \qu{ten and the right hand raised and open, and the thumb sticking out of the fist}, but no modern Vamale word would tie \textit{bwa} to either palm (\textit{yataan}), fist (\textit{daamuun}) nor the right hand (\textit{juu sin}) \parencite[166]{leenhardt_langues_1946}. The element having replaced the coordinator \textit{ka} is another puzzle. The demonstrative pronoun \textit{na} often means \qu{It is X (who did/is Y)}, and may have replaced the former coordinator \textit{ka} \parencite[166]{leenhardt_langues_1946} in a sense of `five, this on top of two' for \qu{7} (\ref{ex:7}). This grammar writes the coordinator \textit{na-bwa} joined by a hyphen to account for its single stress contour.
 
\ea \label{ex:7}
 \gll nim (a)-bwa thaloo\\
	  5    plus   2\\
 \glt \qu{7}\\
 \z 

\begin{table}
	\caption{Complex numerals}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\lsptoprule
		\textit{vajilu na-bwa nim a-bwa se} & \qu{16}\\
		\textit{thaloo vajilu} & \qu{20}\\
		\textit{se apuli} \textit{na-bwa nim a-bwa se}& \qu{26}\footnote{\textit{se apuli} lit. \qu{one person}}\\
		\textit{se apuli na-bwa vajilu}& \qu{30}\\
		\textit{thaloo apuli}& \qu{40} (arch.)\footnote{This is never given spontaneously. People are mentally in a ten-based system now (see the word for 20).}\\
		\textit{nim apuli}& \qu{100} \\
		\textit{apuli ko apuli} & \qu{400}\\
	\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:compo_numbers}
\end{table}

\textit{Vajilu} \qu{10} could be etymologically composed as in (\ref{ex:10}). The last syllable is likely \textit{-lu} marking 3\gl{du}.\gl{poss} on nouns. The system being 5-and 20-based as is typical of the region \parencite[261]{haudricourt_dictionnaire_1982}, and finally \textit{Iaai} saying \qu{two hands} for 10, maybe the etymology of this word is something like in (\ref{ex:10}), but this is purely speculative.

\ea \label{ex:10}
\gll vwa si-lu\\
 \gl{exist} hand-3\gl{du}.\gl{poss}\\
\glt \qu{They have hands/there are their hands.}
\z 

According to \textcite[45]{rivierre_bwatoo_2006}, and also Dego Philippe Gohoupe, another word for 100 is \textit{se apuli} \qu{one person}. This confusing polysemy makes more sense considering that the Pacific Franc used to have a 100 Franc bill with a man on it (see \Cref{fig:100CFP}), was a salient thing, and spoken about much more often than groups of twenty. Nowadays, saying \textit{se apuli} normally means \qu{100}, but \textit{se apuli na bwa se} is \qu{21}, whereas \textit{nim apuli} is \qu{100} if it is part of a complex numeral. Leenhardt notes \textit{nilu apuli} for \qu{100} without glossing it \parencite[166]{leenhardt_langues_1946}{}. Whether \textit{nim apuli} is interpreted as 500 or 100 is difficult to ascertain, since most speakers are unsure. Vamale numerals are rarely used beyond 5 in the language, while French loans are taking over due to school, money, hours of the day, and a decay of counting contributions in customary ceremonies. Multiplying based on 20 is attested in \citetitle{leenhardt_langues_1946} for most languages, amongst which is Hmwaveke with \textit{sec apulip ko apulip} for 400, literally \qu{one person on people, or \qu{20 on 20}}, which suggests, along with \textit{nim apuli} \qu{100 (lit. 5 20)}, that the multiplication base comes last, and the multiplier first \parencite{leenhardt_langues_1946}.

\subsubsection{Ordinals}

\is{Verbs!Ordinals}
\largerpage

Ordinals are formed with \textit{e-}\footnote{\textit{bɛ-} in Cèmuhî, used only with ordinals  \parencite[271]{rivierre_langue_1980}.} and \textit{(k)a-n} \qu{\gl{clf}.\gl{poss}-\gl{nspec}},\footnote{The Cèmuhî cognate [hɛ̃̀] is analyzed as a possessive morpheme by Rivierre \parencite[271]{rivierre_langue_1980} and otherwise only present in part-of-whole compounds.} yielding the forms listed in \Cref{tab:ordinal}. Leenhardt (1946) recorded irregular forms which have now disappeared, \textit{i a vathabun} \qu{the first (lit. s/he who is in front)},\footnote{Leenhardt's \textit{vathabun} is \textit{pa(a)thabun} nowadays.} now regular \textit{i e-se=kan} \qu{the first}, and \textit{i ethice nawe},\footnote{Since the clitic \textit{=(k)a-n} is used for possessum classifying purposes elsewhere, Leenhardt's form could have been \textit{i e-thicen=a-vwe}, with -\textit{vwe} \qu{2\gl{pl}.\gl{poss}}.} now \textit{i e-thien=an}. They, too, are rarely used beyond 5.

\begin{table}
	\caption{Ordinals}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
	\lsptoprule
		\textit{(i) e-se kan} & \qu{(the) first}\\

		\textit{i e-koin an}& \qu{the last}\\
	\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:ordinal}
\end{table}

Ordinal numbers seem to have lexicalized \textit{ka-n} \qu{\gl{clf}.\gl{poss}-\gl{nspec}}, since it cannot be omitted. Onto it, another \textit{ka} can be added (but does not necessarily have to be) in order to make it possessible by the noun \textit{en} \qu{moment} (\ref{ex:kan en}, \ref{ex:kan en2}).

\subsubsection{Multiplicative \textit{o}}
\is{Numerals!Multiplicative}

The multiplicative prefix \textit{o-} (\qu{X times}) only occurs with numerals. The resulting word is derived to an adverb (\ref{ex:o-thiien}). Hence, multiplicatives cannot be predicates in a matrix clause, but do occur in adjunct clauses. Exceptions are interjections like the work call \textit{o-see!} \qu{do at once, in one hard pull}. \textit{O} \qu{X times} is analyzed as a prefix as well in Nêlêmwa \parencite[39]{bril_nelemwa_2002} and Bwatoo (where it is \textit{we-}) \parencite[46]{rivierre_bwatoo_2006}. In (\ref{ex:hunmata}), however, the adverb is possessed by a third person. I analyze this as a zero derivation.

\subsection{Possessible verbs}
\label{ssec:PossV}
\is{Verbs!Possessible verbs}

``Possessible verbs" are distinguished here from ``verbs with \textit{-n}", though they both carry a morpheme \textit{-n} in the third person, because the latter inflect using stative subject indexing suffixes (including \textit{-n} \qu{\gl{nspec}}), and the former take possessive morphology (including \textit{-n} \qu{3\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}}, see \Cref{tab:poss}). There are two subsets of stative possessible verbs, one with alienable and one with inalienable possessive morphology. 
Inalienably possessed intransitive verbs, such as the ones below (\ref{ex:hman1}), are not transparently derived from nouns (\ref{ex:hman3}), with the exception of \textit{nyima-} \qu{heart} \goodtilde \qu{to want}. Nouns can be derived from some of them using typical deverbal constructions (\ref{ex:xhopwen i}).
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \textit{hman-ong} \qu{I am hungry}, \textit{hmana-n}  \qu{s/he is hungry}
\item \textit{bwaa-ng}, \textit{bwaa-n}, \textit{bwaa-ju} \qu{if only}. This has an interjection counterpart \textit{bwaa-m} \qu{poor/darling you!}. Since this item cannot take an article and can stand as clause, it is analyzed as a verb.
\item \textit{holoo-m}, \textit{holoo-u}, \textit{holoo-vwe} \qu{goodbye (you, you two, you all)}
\item \textit{nyim-ong} \qu{I want, like}
\item \textit{vwaseek-ong} \qu{I am sad}

There are few alienably possessed intransitive verbs. They include \textit{yamaan-eong}, \textit{yamaan-ea}, \textit{yamaan-gasu} \qu{be unwilling to do for lack of motivation, be fed up with something}, and \textit{saxhwe-ong}, \textit{saxhwe-a} \qu{refuse to do},\footnote{This possibly contains the morpheme \textit{xhwe} \qu{be across}.} as well as \textit{yathô-ong}, \textit{yathô-a} \qu{be in a hurry}. \textit{Sinu-ong}, \qu{be sick, be suffering; die} also exists as a noun meaning \qu{illness}. % is indistinguishable from stative verbs except in the first person, there is some flexibility.
Possessible verbs, mostly verbs with an Undergoer argument, take possessive morphology usually found on nouns, but cannot bear an article. They are intransitive, like all stative verbs. The second subset, with alienable possessive morphology, could be derived from the very similar stative paradigm, and in many cases the subject-indexing suffixes differ between speakers: \textit{sino-ong} \goodtilde \textit{sinu-o} \qu{ill-1\gl{sg}}, \textit{saxhwe-ong} \goodtilde \textit{saxhwe-o} \qu{refuse-1\gl{sg}}.

 \section{Active verbs}
 \label{sec:ActV}
 \is{Verbs!Active verbs}
Active verbs, the biggest group of verbs, have transitive and intransitive members, and many of them are ambitransitive, meaning they can take an object, but do not have to. As is common in Oceanic languages \parencite[510]{ross_morphosyntactic_2004}, there are no ditransitive verbs in Vamale. This section will first introduce transitive verbs, with their suffixes \textit{-i} and \textit{-ke}, then describe transitive verbs with nominal inflection (called \qu*{dependent} transitive verbs), before addressing transitive verbs that require a preposition \textit{ko-} \qu{on}.

Active intransitive verbs are formally not distinct from transitive verbs, except in that they do not take object suffixes. This is in line with Proto-Oceanic \parencite[81]{lynch_oceanic_2002}. Both transitive (e.g. \textit{vavi} \qu{hunt something}) and ambitransitive verbs (e.g. \textit{xaahni} \qu{check, stare (at)}) can occur without an argument, before other (ad)verbal elements of the verb phrase, or with a generic argument, and will still carry transitive suffixes \textit{-i} or \textit{-ke}, discussed below. Purely intransitive ones usually do not end in \textit{-i} or \textit{-ke}, see (\ref{ex:intrV}). All active verbs take subject marking bound pronouns, as in examples (\ref{ex:index_actV}) and (\ref{ex:index_actV2}). \Cref{tab:markers2} lists the bound pronouns.

\ea \label{ex:intrV}\gll tabo tabo li=xho thamo, thêên thêên li=xho xayu\\

\z

\subsection{Transitive verbs}
\label{ssec:TransV}
Transitive verbs mark the subject at the beginning and the undergoer object (if animate, but this condition is disappearing) at the end (\ref{ex:actV}).\footnote{In example \REF{ex:actV}, the subject marker was omitted. This may be due to the elicitation context, where there no referent for the chaser was established. } There are no ditransitive verbs; non-core arguments such as recipients, goals, experiencers and stimuli (depending, of course, on the verb) are marked with the oblique markers \textit{nyasi-} and \textit{nyako-} (see \sectref{sec:oblique}). The transitive verb \textit{holeke} \qu{thank, receive}, for example, has the Theme as a direct object and the Recipient is added through \textit{nyako}- or \textit{nyasi}- (\ref{ex:nyasi_bofukaje}). \textit{nyasi}- is more polite and can only be used with humans. Transitive verbs almost invariably appear with the now lexicalized transitive suffix \textit{-i}, \is{Transitivity!Transitive \textit{-i}}\is{Transitivity!Transitive \textit{-ke}}possibly descended from Proto-Oceanic \textit{*-i} \parencite[507]{ross_morphosyntactic_2004}, or with the still productive \textit{-ke}, possibly descended from \textit{*-akin(i)} \parencite[507]{ross_morphosyntactic_2004}. \sectref{ssec:ke_i} describes this in more detail. Transitive verbs without these suffixes are e.g. \textit{tua} \qu{detach}, \textit{tuu} \qu{take something out of somewhere}, \textit{sivu} \qu{blow; smoke}.

\subsubsection{Transitive suffixes \textit{-ke} and \textit{-i}}
\label{ssec:ke_i}
\is{Transitivity!Transitive \textit{-ke}}
The transitive suffix -\textit{ke} is the only productive transitive suffix in Vamale. This grammar calls \textit{-ke} a transitive rather than applicative suffix because it does not routinely turn obliques into direct objects, but can derive transitive from intransitive verbs, or even transitive verbs from complex verbs and nouns. Furthermore, and perhaps most importantly, the suffix is in complementary distribution with an object marker: \textit{-ke} appears if the animate object is not overt, as in examples (\ref{ex:ke_noke1}) and (\ref{ex:ke_noke2}). This distiguishes \textit{-ke} from \textit{-i}, which is part of the stem and cannot be replaced.\footnote{Contrary to the Vamale form \textit{-ke}, the Cèmuhî cognate {[}-hĩ] can derive stative and impersonal verbs such as {[}tìtì] \qu{wet} (Vam. \textit{titi}) \qu{to be likely to wet something} and [ūtɛ̄] \qu{rain} (Vam. \textit{uta}) to {[}ūtɛ̄-hĩ] \qu{to be rained upon} \parencite[255]{rivierre_langue_1980}.} Note that both \textit{-ke} and \textit{-i} (described further down) likely have Proto-Oceanic origins, \textit{*-akin(i)} and \textit{*-i}, respectively \parencite[507]{ross_morphosyntactic_2004}, though the latter are reconstructed as applicative suffixes.

%, but sometimes the transitivity of the verb is clear in total absence of an idea of the object, its number etc (). 
%\textit{xaleke?} \qu{see?} is a common discourse marker and elicits a minimal response, can take an object, but does not have to. 
Most verbs that take \textit{-ke} and (still) have a counterpart without the suffix, are active verbs, as \Cref{tab:ke} shows. For example, the verb \textit{xaleke} \qu{to look at something, to see something} has two sisters that also relate to visual intake: \textit{xale} \qu{to look without clear purpose} is either intransitive and means \qu{to look around}, or means \qu{to visit} and takes animate undergoers (\ref{ex:xale}).

\begin{sloppypar}
\textit{Xalo koo-n} \qu{gaze (at something, with no implication of understanding or recognition)} illustrates another way of expressing transitivity: with \textit{ko} \qu{\gl{obl}} (see \sectref{ssec:koon}). \textit{Xhaavwa koo-n} \qu{wait around for it} is the less transitive counterpart to \textit{xhavwaleke} \qu{await}, possibly because \textit{xhavwale} would look like a transitive 3\gl{pl} object verb. Another possibility would be an older form \textit{xhwaavwat} that eventually dropped the last plosive to yield modern \textit{xhaavwa}. This would be similar to \textit{sesaat} \qu{sneak}, \textit{sesaaleke} \qu{stalk}. %Pije te-hyaakhô
The suffix -\textit{ke} is not reserved for animate objects, as \textit{feanake} \qu{to show} illustrates in example (\ref{ex:feanake}): if the animate undergoer is present as a noun phrase, \textit{-ke} remains, otherwise the undergoer is indexed via a suffix (\ref{ex:feanaa}).% , \textit{holeke} \qu{to thank for, receive}, \textit{xhateeke}\footnote{Possibly from \textit{xat} \qu{sun}. \textit{xhat} \qu{clitoris} seems an unlikely root.} \qu{to dry something} show.

\textit{-ke} is also used with the stative verb \textit{xhwatii-n} \qu{be small},  yielding \textit{xhwatiike} \qu{do softly}, as in (\ref{ex:xhwatiike}). Note that \textit{xhwatiike}, despite the translation given here, is not a transitive verb, nor indeed an independent one, but a manner verb postponed to the main verb describing the action, e.g. \textit{jili xhwatiike} \qu{build slowly}, or \textit{hmata xhwatiike} \qu{sing softly}.

\is{Transitivity!Transitive \textit{-i}}
Another, much more common, suffix is \textit{-i}. Contrary to \textit{-ke}, \textit{-i} is not used to increase the transitivity of a verb, or to derive it. However, it must have been in the past, as numerous pairs attest. Consider a few in \Cref{tab:i}. Other examples include \textit{thati} \qu{beat}, \textit{wati} \qu{chase} and \textit{titabwi} \qu{welcome}, which do not have a counterpart lacking \textit{-i}.

Far Northern Nelêmwa, lacking articles, has a system of verb suffixes to make transitivity and animacy distinctions. The language uses a basic intransitive form and two more or less transitive ones, which distinguish non-human (\textit{-a}\slash\mbox{\textit{-u}}), and non-specific human \textit{-e} arguments  from specific human ones \textit{-i} \parencite[44]{bril_nelemwa_2002}. \textit{-i} in Vamale has lost its transparent function and has become lexicalized.  \textit{-a} and \textit{-e} are also still present in Vamale, though they form an even smaller set of transitive/intransitive pairs: some verbs ending with \textit{-a} form pairs with others ending with \textit{-e}, the latter being transitive, the former not. In the case of \textit{fwada-i} \qu{to look for something}, a transitivization of *\textit{fwada} seems to have taken place. The attested Vamale pairs with \textit{-a}\slash\textit{-e} are: 

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item \textit{vila/vile} \qu{dance/dodge} 
	\item \textit{buna/bune} \qu{thieve/steal}
	\item \textit{fwada-i/fwade} \qu{search (inanim)/search (anim)}
	\item \textit{tipwa/tipwe} \qu{fall, drop} (the latter only preserved in \textit{vwa-tipwe} \qu{drop})

\is{Verbs!Dependent transitive verbs}
Nominal inflection on verbs is mostly seen in stative verbs, as described in \sectref{ssec:Verbs_n}. For certain transitive verbs, however, generic objects and complement verbs (e.g. \textit{caihna-n {\ob}tena-n{\cb}}\textsubscript{\gl{comp}} in (\ref{ex:tena})) are marked with the generic suffix \textit{-n}. Examples are listed in \Cref{tab:transVnomMorph}. This section does not discuss verbal compounds containing a possessible noun (V + N-\gl{poss}), where the undergoer is marked via possessive morphology, e.g. \textit{wai-nyoo-n} \qu{tie-neck-3\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}} \qu{hang him(self)}, or	\textit{caa-pala-n} \qu{step.on-talk-3\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}} \qu{answer}.

The morphology of dependent transitive verbs reacts to animacy, as \Cref{tab:Vn} and to the co-occurrence of the undergoer in the same clause.

\begin{sloppypar}
This makes dependent transitive verbs similar to dependent stative verbs, verbs ending in \textit{-ke}, and prepositions: verbs with animate undergoers can omit the undergoer-indexing person suffix (e.g. \textit{-o} \qu{1\gl{sg}.\gl{obj}}) in favor of taking a generic \textit{-n} only if the undergoer %occurs in the same clause, or 
is indeed generic (\ref{ex:spec_anim1}): V-\textit{n} \gl{obj}\textsubscript{\gl{nspec}}. This probably includes anaphoric use, but is not attested in the corpus so far. If the animate undergoer is specific and does not appear in the same clause, the dependent verb, like all other transitive verbs, must index it (\ref{ex:spec_anim2}): V-\gl{obj} (*[\gl{art} \gl{obj}\textsubscript{\gl{spec}}]). If the undergoer is specific and appears as an NP in the same clause, regardless of animacy, the verb takes no suffix, personal or generic (\ref{ex:spec_anim1a}), (\ref{ex:spec_inanim2}): V [\gl{art} \gl{obj}].

Verbs with inanimate undergoers distinguish two scenarios: either the undergoer is specific and follows the verb, or not. They will drop the generic undergoer index \textit{-n} only if a specific undergoer NP follows the verb: V \gl{art} \gl{obj}\textsubscript{\gl{spec}}. One example is (\ref{ex:spec_inanim2}). Note that \textit{-n} is used anaphorically for inanimate undergoers, as in (\ref{ex:spec_inanim1}), regardless of their specificity.
%The verbs' morphology distinguishes the animacy of the object: \textit{-n} for generic (\ref{ex:spec_anim1}), or inanimate omitted (\ref{ex:spec_inanim1}), objects, and no \textit{-n} for specific objects that are expressed as noun phrases (\ref{ex:spec_inanim2}).\todo{This does suggest a conflation, but it is it really related to animacy? [generic+inanimate AND omitted] vs. [specific AND overt] Is semantics (which one, really), syntax, or both responsible for the morphological opposition? What do you really mean????}

There are constructions that are, at least diachronically, active or stative V+N compounds (see \Cref{tab:VNcompPoss}, and example (\ref{ex:se-ma})). This means that arguments are marked by nominal possessive morphology. This study does not count these lexicalized former verb phrases (with possessive suffixes) as identical to the dependent transitive verbs in \Cref{tab:transVnomMorph}, which use object suffixes. This view is shared with Rivierre on Bwatoo \parencite[50]{rivierre_bwatoo_2006}.

\subsubsection{Verbs with \textit{ko-} Arguments}
\label{ssec:V_ko}

The latter scenario likely affects verbs that were intransitive and whose oblique addition became so common that the form lexicalized, creating a pair. An example of this is \textit{nyima-} \qu{to want}, and \textit{nyima- ko-} \qu{to like, love}. For a number of verbs (some of which are illustrated in \Cref{tab:ko}), this hypothetical development left the \textit{ko}-less form behind, and the verb phrase now needs \textit{ko} to be grammatical. This grammar does not analyze \textit{ko} as a suffix, incorporated into the verb, because \textit{ko-} is a p-word, and because the possessor marked on \textit{ko-} is an undergoer argument. Indeed, all of these \textit{ko}-needing verbs are transitive.

\subsection{Benefactive nouns}
\is{Nouns!Benefactive nouns}

``Benefactive nouns" are constructions which can be formed with only a few lexical items. The forms available for this construction are ambiguous as to their nominal or verbal status. They take an alienable possessive pronoun which marks a beneficiary argument. The few attested examples suggest a de-nominal derivation, where a possessive construction is verbalized by adding a subject index. Note that the two spontaneously produced constructions in examples (\ref{ex:BenefN1}) and (\ref{ex:BenefN3}) used nouns which have identical verbal counterparts. %A form accepted in elicitation, \textit{vii} \qu{say}, breaks that mold (\ref{ex:viigaa}).

Spatial deixis is ubiquitous in Vamale discourse; using a geocentric orientation system since the Proto-Oceanic stage \parencite{francois_reconstructing_2004}, the language is infused with references to various axes and cosmologically relevant points. Since moving through space is chiefly expressed verbally, this section of mostly lexical interest is placed in \chapref{ChapterVerbs}, though deverbal derivations are also discussed. %\citeauthor{cauchard_study_2014}  an entire PhD thesis on the topic in Caaac, however, meaning that the following section can only scratch the surface. %%todo This is a very bizarre sentence, on so many levels (including the missing subject agreement in the subordinate clause)...!

\subsection{Up/down} 
\label{sec:up-down}
\textit{Hut} \qu{move down} has several meanings derived from Kanak worldview: following an Oceanic tradition, going down also means moving towards the sea. Since sailing to other islands is done at sea, \textit{hut} also means moving out into the world (e.g. the Loyalty Islands, or France). Related to this is the sense of leaving the house (traditionally built on a mound due to floods). A third sense of \textit{hut} is following the tradewinds, north-east along the coast. In contrast to this, \textit{ta} \qu{move up} is used spatially for moving towards the mountains, up and deeper into a house or the land, and south-west, i.e. having to laboriously sail against the prevailing winds. In combination with other motion verbs, \textit{ta}, \textit{han} \qu{move on the same level} and \textit{hut} have allomorphs that assimilate to the previous verb, and to the directional suffixes \textit{-me} \qu{\gl{dir.cp}} and \textit{-le} \qu{\gl{dir.cf}}. \textit{Hma} \qu{arrive} forms the following compounds: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{hma-han-me} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hmasame} \qu{arrive here (moving on the same level)}
	\item \textit{hma-hut-me} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hmasupe} \qu{arrive here (moving down)}
	\item \textit{hma-ta-me} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hmacame} \qu{arrive here (moving up)}
	\item \textit{hma-han-le} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hmasade} \qu{arrive there (moving on the same level)}
	\item \textit{hma-hut-le} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hmasute} \qu{arrive there (moving down)}
	\item \textit{hma-ta-le} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hmacale} \qu{arrive there (moving up)}
\end{enumerate}

Note that /l/ $\rightarrow$ /t/ after /t/, and /m/ $\rightarrow$ /p/ in the same context. /ta/ is affricated to /ca/, and /h/ $\rightarrow$ /s/. This last sound change is unique to the compounds discussed above.

%\textit{da} can mean \qu{plain, flat stretch of land}, \qu{spear}, \qu{what?}, and is an allomorph of \textit{ta} \qu{move up} (fun: \textit{tada} \qu{be startled so as to jump up or do a jerky motion}. It is possibly related to the aspectual marker \textit{da(a)}, \qu{do in advance}, which might then mean that one moves up in time, as one does in social space (movement and time are also conflated in other Oceanic languages \parencite[202]{bril_nelemwa_2002}). \textit{Han da!} \qu{go ahead [we will catch up]!}

\textit{Hnuut} \qu{move downstream} and \textit{hnuda} \qu{move upstream}\footnote{This is not the same as \textit{saxhuti} \qu{follow the course of a river/road/coastline; tell a story}.} have cognates across the archipelago, except in the riverless Loyalty islands \parencite[232]{bearune_lexpression_2012}.
Interestingly, this axis is also used for southward (\textit{hnuda} \qu{move upstream}) and northward movement along a limited part of the coast, between {Cem}\footnote{\qu{Landing point} in Cèmuhî.} and {Lideraalik}, see \Cref{fig:map_hnuuda}. The northern limit of this area depends on the speakers' home, between {Pedaac} and {Koulnoué}, but the southern limit is {Cem}, about 10 km along the coast south of the bridge over the {Tipije}. This area corresponds roughly to the valleys of Wanaa and We Hava, whose defining creeks Kaciabwec and We Hava flow southeast-northwest, i.e. parallel to the coast. Beyond this area, \textit{hut} \qu{move northwards} and \textit{ta} \qu{move southwards} are used (see \sectref{sec:up-down}).

\subsection{Spatial adverbs}
\label{ssec:spat_adv}
Vamale derives spatial adverbs from the verbs \textit{hut} \qu{go down}, \textit{ta} \qu{go up}, and \textit{han} \qu{move on the same level, go}. The adverbs in question, prefixed with \textit{xa-}, \textit{xa-hut} \qu{down there}, \textit{xa-da} \qu{up there}, and \textit{xa-han} \qu{over there}, form the basis of this system and are unrelated to the demonstratives in \sectref{ssec:Prox}. They are described in more detail in \sectref{ssec:prox_Adv}, but an overview is given in \Cref{tab:space}. 
Spatial words can be combined with other words (\textit{hoot xahut} \qu{far down.there}) or with each other (\textit{nyaut xahut} \qu{just down there (but too far to reach)}).

\subsection{\textit{Nya} \qu{around, towards, inside}}
\label{ssec:nya}
\is{Space!\textit{nya} \qu{around, towards, inside}}
\textit{(H)nya} \qu{put, give, send} is a multi-purpose morpheme, especially in the context of space. One function of \textit{nya} is to combine with prepositions to form new prepositions, locating the theme as contained by or very close to the prepositioned location: \textit{ca-} \qu{at} $\rightarrow$ \textit{nye-ca-} \qu{inside} (\ref{ex:nya1}), \textit{pwa-} \qu{on top of}, $\rightarrow$ \textit{nya-pwa-} \qu{upon}, \textit{ko} \qu{on (touching a part of it)}, \textit{nya-ko} \qu{immediately on; apply on} (\ref{ex:nyako}). In this function, \textit{nya} also appears as a prefix in spatial adverbs (see \sectref{ssec:prox_Adv}), to form a proximal form (\textit{nya-ut} \qu{(put) down, down there at an arm's length}). \textit{Nya} often displays a phonologically conditioned allomorph \textit{nye} when preceding the article \textit{i} \qu{\gl{def}.\gl{sg}}, and palatal /c/, as in (\ref{ex:nya1}).


\ea\label{ex:nya1}\gll le=vwa-vaci li=apuli nye-ca i nye-ca i=mwa-n daahma\\

 wrap \gl{loc}-on \gl{def}.\gl{sg}=tree\\
\glt \qu{wrap around the tree} {[X9:20]}
\z

\textit{Nya} can also mean \qu{toward}, a meaning that is related to \qu{send}. In combination with spatial adverbs, \textit{nya} forms two paradigms: the series \textit{nya-xahut/nya-xada/nya-xahan} is almost equivalent in meaning to \textit{xahan} \qu{over there} etc. It means \qu{in the vicinity of X}, whereas \textit{xahan} etc. designate a more precise location.  In (\ref{ex:nya_from}) and (\ref{ex:nya_cricket}), \textit{nya} is used to express a vague area. The other paradigm combines \textit{nya-an}/\textit{nya-ut}/\textit{nya-da} \qu{send, put there/down/up} with the basic adverbial form, which yields a comparatively farther meaning, e.g. \textit{nya-an (mwa) xahan} \qu{(even) further away in this general direction} (see \sectref{ssec:spat_adv}).

\glt \qu{And she stands here, and behind her stands the cricket pitcher. Maybe around there stands the other [player].} {[PJ:29]}
\z

\textit{Nya} is frequently used to locate something in a named place, especially villages, as in (\ref{ex:nya_tgnpk}). This may be a strategy to avoid having to use more specific terms such as \textit{xahut} \qu{down there}, but no clear pattern was identified.

\subsection{Same-level axis}
\is{Space!Same-level axis}
\is{Verbs!Prefixes!Manner}
Volitional displacement on the same level is expressed with the active verb \textit{han} or the derived adverb \textit{xahan} \qu{over there on the same level}. The movement of an object, e.g. in the wind, is called \textit{va(a)ya} \qu{movement, work}. Depending on the context, \textit{han} can mean \qu{go}, e.g. \textit{ha-de-ha-me} \qu{go-\gl{dir.cf}-go-\gl{dir.cp}} \qu{to and fro}, and \qu{walk}, e.g. \textit{han-maa} \qu{walk on the reef at low tide to gather sea-food}. There is an increase of the use of \textit{han} among less fluent speakers, which may be due to French influence. 

Nowadays, \textit{han} means \qu{to walk} and \textit{thêên} \qu{to run, to fly}, but the manner prefix \textit{t(h)e-} \qu{to do while walking} is probably derived from \textit{thêên}. Since this is the case for both Hienghène languages (\textit{hen} \qu{walk} in Pije, but \textit{te-} \qu{while walking}) and Voh-Koné ones, the split must be an old one.


\subsection{Centripetal/-fugal axis -\textit{me}, \textit{-le}}
\is{Space!Centripetal/-fugal}
\largerpage
There are two main suffixes used to express motion to and from the utterance's point of reference. While this center is usually the speaker, stories may set the center somewhere else more or less explicitly,\footnote{This was described for Caac as well \parencite[176]{cauchard_study_2014}.} and hypothetical or past situations can also feature these suffixes.
The movement verbs assimilate the final consonant's place of articulation to \textit{-me} \qu{\gl{dir.cp}}: \textit{ta} \qu{go up}+ \textit{-me} $\rightarrow$ \textit{tame} \qu{come up}, \textit{hut} \qu{go down} + \textit{-me} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hupe} \qu{come down}, \textit{han} \qu{go} + \textit{-me} $\rightarrow$ \textit{hame} \qu{come}. The other suffix \textit{-le} \qu{\gl{dir.cf}} assimilates to the verb's final consonant: \textit{ta-le} \qu{leave upwards}, \textit{hut-e} \qu{leave downwards}, and \textit{han-de} \qu{go away}. The latter is another example of the relationship between alveolar plosives and liquids mentioned in \sectref{ssec:ka_CL}.

Motion verbs can be added to a verb phrase if a centripetal or centrifugal meaning is needed, as other verbs cannot take \textit{-me} or \textit{-le}, as in (\ref{ex:added_hame}).
\ea \label{ex:added_hame}\gll kona sili sahmwa ha-me sili sahmwa ha-me\\ then pierce other.way go-\gl{dir.cp} pierce other.way go-\gl{dir.cp}\\

\subsection{Origin of motion}
\label{ssec:mo_ko}
\is{Space!Origin of motion \textit{moo}}
In order to express the origin of a motion, \textit{moo} \qu{stay} is preposed to the source, and postposed to the motion verb, as in (\ref{ex:Vmoo}).

\ea \label{ex:Vmoo}\gll na tha go=saat moo cahni\\
 \gl{dem} \gl{ass} 2\gl{sg}=wade from here \\
\glt \qu{You wade in the water from here.} {[RP:6]}

\subsection{Others}

This section has not made a complete description of spatial expressions in Vamale, a daunting task that has become a PhD thesis in its own right for both Nengone \parencite{bearune_lexpression_2012} and Caac \parencite{cauchard_study_2014}. The chapter mostly focused on the main axes of motion, proximity,\footnote{Proximal and distal demonstratives are discussed in \sectref{ssec:Prox}.} and centripetal/centrifugal motion, but there is a lexical field of prepositions (e.g. \textit{pwa-} \qu{on}, \textit{xala-} \qu{under}, \textit{cela-} \qu{beside}, \textit{patemwano} \qu{right next to}, \textit{ca-} \qu{at}) (see \sectref{ssec:WCPrepoNouns}), manner verbs (e.g. \textit{falogavi} \qu{move across diagonally}), and verbs describing motion more specifically, e.g. \textit{cop} \qu{go over a mountain, go to the other coast; surpass someone} or \textit{saat}\footnote{There are also \textit{sesaat} \qu{walk slowly, sneak}, and \textit{sesaaleke} \qu{stalk} which could be related.} \qu{walk through water, ford a river}. The next section leaves the lexical domain of space and addresses productive prefixes denoting posture and ways of doing things.

\section{Prefixes}
\label{sec:VPrefix}
\is{Verbs!Prefixes}
\largerpage
The following derivational prefixes are distinct from TAM markers in that they are not independent words, although they express similar meanings, and are partly sensitive to aktionsart. \Cref{tab:pref_Manner} lists them with examples.
%Many of the prefixes are derived from verbs. %todo bar
Prefixes of manner are all derived from verbs and in many cases lexicalized, though some still appear productive. \textit{The-} is a polysemous prefix, as it not only contributes its expected \qu{do while walking/running} meaning to verbs, but also takes more aspectual meanings, depending on the verb and its context (see \sectref{ssec:the}). Prefixes are presented here in \Cref{ChapterVerbs} while aspectual markers, which are own words, are described in  \Cref{ChapterAspect}, and anything that is exclusive to the verb phrase but not part of the verb, in \chapref{ChapterVP}.

\subsection{Prefixes of manner}
\label{sec:Manner}
\is{Verbs!Prefixes!Manner}
Manner prefixes can be added to roots to express how something is done, and have in many cases become lexicalized, i.e. are not added to new words, but can be identified as bearing meaning in several verbs. % %todo what is a lexicalized environment?
For example, \citeauthor{rivierre_bwatoo_2006} analyze some words as complex (e.g. \textit{tha-bilo-ke} \qu{to kill}, \citeyear[61]{rivierre_bwatoo_2006}), which are not attested without their manner prefix, or indeed with another prefix, in Vamale. Bound verbal forms which are still attested in the dictionary include: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{-bii} \qu{crack} from POc *piti(k) \qu{crack} \parencite[276]{ross_lexicon_1998},\begin{enumerate}
		\item  \textit{cu-bi(i)} \qu{break bread} 
		\item \textit{cu-bite} \qu{be squashed by a crowd}
		\item \textit{caa-bite} \qu{harvest}
		\item \textit{ca-bi} \qu{smash something brittle by hand or blunt tool}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textit{-bwane} \qu{split} from POc *pʷalaq \qu{split} \parencite[265]{ross_lexicon_1998}, e.g. \textit{tha-bwane vai} \qu{split stone}, \qu{Téganpaïk (a village name)}
	\item \textit{-bali} \qu{drive in}, e.g. \textit{tha-bali} \qu{to nail}, \textit{coo-bahli} \qu{push someone away with the hand}
	\item \textit{-theeke} \qu{push}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{pitheeke} \qu{to push someone away}
	\item \textit{caatheeke} \qu{push away with a stick}
	\item \textit{sibatheeke} \qu{push someone in a direction}
	\item \textit{tha-theeke} \qu{kill with a spear}
	\item possibly \textit{theeke} \qu{blow on food}
	\end{enumerate}
Note that in the first three examples listed for \textit{-theeke}, the preceding parts are transparent.
\end{enumerate} Manner prefixes have been described in \citetitle{ozanne-rivierre_verbal_2004}, called ``classificatory prefixes" there \parencite[349]{ozanne-rivierre_verbal_2004}, and are typical of New Caledonian languages, albeit more frequent in Southern languages than in Northern ones. It is possible that a compound consisting of a shortened transitive manner verb and an action verb was already a feature of Proto-Mainland \parencite[354]{ozanne-rivierre_verbal_2004}, as these prefixes appear throughout the main island, but have diversified clearly within the two groups North and South. Having a variety of verbs for striking with different tools is an old feature of Oceanic. \Cref{tab:POcV} (page~\pageref{tab:POcV}) gives a short selection of Proto-Oceanic verbs.\footnote{The form *sasa is given by \parencite{grace_proto-oceanic_1969}.} The posture prefixes \textit{cu-} \qu{do standing}, \textit{ta-} \qu{do sitting}, see (\ref{ex:ta-meebam}), and \textit{mi-} \qu{do lying down}, are unique to Northern languages \parencite[356]{ozanne-rivierre_verbal_2004}. Note that Ozanne-Rivierre and Rivierre call verbs prefixed by the morphemes described here ``compound verbs", whereas I use the term exclusively for verbs where all components are also attested as single head verbs.

\subsection{\textit{the-} }
\label{ssec:the}
\is{Verbs!Prefixes!\textit{the-} \qu{quickly, a bit; while walking}}
The prefix \textit{the-} is halfway between a prefix of manner and an aspect marker. It likely comes from \textit{thêên} \qu{run, fly} and still exists as a manner prefix, as illustrated in the words \textit{the-thagavi} \qu{take a shortcut} and \textit{the-yathô} \qu{walk-stress; walk in a hurry}. It seems, however, that this use has become lexicalized.

The productive, non-manner prefix \textit{t(h)e-} has two meanings, depending on the aktionsart of the verb. With punctual verbs, it means \qu{do quickly, a bit}. With durative ones, it means \qu{do continually since earlier}, often with reference to another event, e.g. \textit{the-xaleke} \qu{look at constantly}, and (\ref{ex:constant_the}). This is likely due to its putative origin \textit{thêên} \qu{run, fly}. In imperatives, \textit{the-} always asks for immediate action: \qu{do this now}. 
While \textit{the-}prefixed verbs, when preceded by TAM markers, often do not take on idiosyncratic meanings, some combinations are interesting. Frequentative \textit{mu}, habitual \textit{xa}, and imperfective/future \textit{bwa} do not change the meaning, but \textit{pa} \qu{\gl{prf}} excludes an interpretation of the event as quickly done; the yielded meaning focuses on the time spent on it (``it took me a long time to do it"). This effect is even stronger with \textit{pa ja} \qu{\gl{prf}.\gl{prf}}. With progressive \textit{kon}, \textit{the-} means \qu{right now, immediately}. 
With durative verbs, \textit{the-} takes on a durative, imperfective meaning, and is similar in function to the adverb \textit{hnyana} \qu{constantly}.\footnote{See \textit{hnyana-} \qu{breath}, from which it is probably derived.} Compare the pair of examples (\ref{ex:constant_hnyana}) and (\ref{ex:constant_the}) for said similar meanings, but see examples (\ref{ex:the_vs_hnyana}) and (\ref{ex:the_vs_hnyana2}) for the differences.

\z

\begin{sloppypar}
When describing a situation that is unique and limited in time, \textit{the-} and \textit{hnyana} are interchangeable. However, more general, or abstract, situations, \textit{the-} \qu{\gl{thedur}} takes a meaning similar to \textit{the-} \qu{\textsc{the\textsubscript{punct}}}, see examples (\ref{ex:the_vs_hnyana}) and (\ref{ex:the_vs_hnyana2}). This is reminiscent of \textit{mwa} \qu{again, now, however} in \sectref{sec:WCRepetitive}.

%\subction{Imperative use of \textit{the-}, and \textit{xhaa-}}
\is{Clauses!Imperative clauses}

\textit{The-} can be used with imperative verbs, where it asks for immediate action: \qu{do this now, do this quickly}. Another prefix, \textit{xhaa-} \qu{\gl{att}}, only appears in the imperative mood and acts as an attenuative prefix, \qu{do a bit} (\ref{ex:the_imp}). In some scenarios, the two have similar meanings.% shortens vowel if combined with e.g. \textit{da}, \textit{the}, etc. possibly not phonemically long vowel.

\ea \label{ex:the_imp}\gll xhaa-thagavi ye-mwago ma go=xaleke i=vaaya koo-n\\
 \gl{att}-cut tree-mango \gl{subr} 2\gl{sg}=see \gl{def}.\gl{sg}=work \gl{obl}-\gl{nspec}\\
\glt \qu{Just (try to) cut a mango tree and you’ll see the work it is.} {[example sentence provided for the dictionary entry on \textit{xhaa}]}
\z
 
The attenuative meaning of \textit{xhaa-} is found with imperative \textit{the-} when the latter is used to suggest that the action asked for will be quick. The difference, however, is that \textit{the}- suggests a quickly done task, whereas \textit{xhaa}- means you do something for a short while, without necessarily finishing what you started. \textit{The-} and \textit{xha(a)-} can be combined (\ref{ex:xhaa}). When combined, their meaning depends on the verb's aktionsart: \qu{quickly do now (\gl{punc})}, \qu{do a non-committally big or small bit of it (\gl{dur})}.

\ea \label{ex:xhaa}

Two morphemes can be used to sort an action with respect to other actions: \textit{da(a)} \qu{do first} (\ref{ex:da_first}), and \textit{ra-} \qu{do afterwards} (\ref{ex:ra}). Note that the latter is the only phonemic example of /ɾ/, and was only encountered in elicitation sessions.

A pluractional prefix \textit{e-} occurs in various constructions where several entities perform the same action at the same time, but not to each other, e.g. (\ref{ex:ehan_caile}) and (\ref{ex:etipwa}). The prefix is reconstructed to be a reflex of POc *paRi-, which otherwise has reflexive, reciprocal, and middle functions. If \textit{e-} were left out, the pluractional meaning would be lost, and the participants would be engaged in their activities in a more individual manner: compare examples (\ref{ex:ehan_cain}) and (\ref{ex:ehan_caile}) to \textit{le han cai-n} \qu{They follow him} and \textit{le han cai-le} \qu{They follow them}. Note that in constructions such as (\ref{ex:ehan_caile}), the meaning is somewhat in between reciprocal (they follow each other), further described in \sectref{sec:refl}, and pluractional (they each follow a different person). This is called ``chaining" by Bril, and widely attested throughout the archipelago \parencite[32, 47]{bril_semantic_2005b}.

A difference between reference and occurrence, i.e. whether several things happen at once, or the same action several times, is made analytically, by adding \textit{sisipo} \qu{together} at the end of the verb phrase, or \textit{vataan} \qu{each, individually} as a preverb. 

In (\ref{ex:ve-moo}), similarly to contexts of \textit{mee} \qu{all} described in \sectref{ssec:se-me}, the action is performed by several people together. However, while \textit{mee} usually merely implies that out of a group, everyone participates, \textit{(v)e-} here adds a semantic trait of indistinguishability \parencite[66--73]{kemmer_middle_1993}. The participants sit together and form an indistinct group, whose members do not participate in the sitting separately.

\section{Complex verbs}
\label{sec:ComplexV}
\is{Verbs!Complex verbs}
This section introduces three ways in which Vamale forms complex verbs. Following an ancient Oceanic tradition, some verbs are reduplicated. Though not very prevalent in Vamale, some examples are discussed in \sectref{sec:redup}. Verbs and other verbs may join to form compounds, and verbs and nouns are also frequent partners in the creation of new words. 

\subsection{Reduplication}
\label{sec:redup}
\is{Reduplication}
\is{Verbs!Reduplication}
True reduplication in Vamale is rare. Cases abound where a verb is repeated, to express the length, urgency, intensity etc. of a notion: most frequent is the context of a serial verb construction (described in \sectref{sec:SVC}), but verbs are also repeated in a poetic context such as in (\ref{ex:xho}), or in a playful one (\ref{ex:javelo}). These verbs usually have their own prosodic environment and the whole construction is lexically transparent.\largerpage[-1]


\ea \label{ex:xho}
(Cicada-hunting children's song)\\
\gll tabo tabo li=xho thamo thêên thêên li=xho xayu\\
 sit sit \gl{def}.\gl{pl}=cicada female fly fly \gl{def}.\gl{pl}=cicada male\\
\glt \qu{Sit sit oh female cicadas [full of eggs], fly fly (away) oh male cicadas.} {[vamale-181121-xho\_thamo]}
\z

\ea \label{ex:javelo}
(Stone-skipping call)\\
\gll jaaaavelo-velo-velo-velo\\
 ricochet\\
\glt \qu{ricochet-chet-chet-chet}
\z

The attested cases in which a word is repeated and forms a new word are the following: \textit{fwa-fwa} \qu{hole-hole} \qu{full of holes}, \textit{vaya-vaya} \qu{move-move} \qu{wobbly}, and \textit{xhasaat-xhasaat} \qu{jump-jump} \qu{hobble, jump around on one foot or to get warm}. While the consultant said that there were many other cases, I found none.

\subsection{Compound verbs}
\label{ssec:CompoundV}
\is{Verbs!Compound verbs}
\largerpage[-2]
Compound verbs are composed of a verb, which determines the resulting construction's word-class and often plays a dominant role in its semantics, and another element. The interesting case of the verb \textit{hnya} \qu{put, send} and spatial adverbs such as \textit{xahan} \qu{over there}, which combine to \textit{(h)nya-xahan} \qu{in this direction}, is an exception. These combined words are adverbs (see \sectref{ssec:nya}), as evidenced by verb phrases like \textit{hnya hnya-xada} \qu{put over there}, and will not be discussed further here.

An important group of compound verbs are composed of the vague verb \textit{vwa} \qu{do}, and a specifying verb, e.g. \textit{vwa-suu} \qu{do break} \qu{pay someone}, \textit{vwa tau} \qu{do impact} \qu{fish},\footnote{This is almost certainly a taboo avoidance strategy. Hunters never use \textit{vap} \qu{to hunt} if they go out, instead they say \textit{balan thaap} \qu{length nyaouli [a savannah tree species]} when describing their plans, to avoid bad luck. \textit{Vwa tau} would have replaced the marked word. Word avoidance taboos are commonplace in this region of the world. Perhaps the word for \qu{wound}, \textit{ape aman} \qu{trace\slash track of something} is kept vague on purpose.\is{Word avoidance taboo}} or \textit{vwa-thiho} \qu{do-stumble} \qu{do by accident}. Another group, small but very often used, are the lexicalized serial verb constructions (SVCs) with \textit{fe} \qu{take} and motion verbs, e.g. (\ref{ex:feame}). Other verb compounds also seem to be lexicalized SVCs, e.g. \textit{saahma-cuut} \qu{rise-be.standing} \qu{to stand up}, and \textit{ha-de-ha-me} \qu{go-\gl{dir.cf}-go-\gl{dir.cp}} \qu{move to and fro}.

\ea \label{ex:feame}
\gll fe-(h)a(n)-me\\
 take-go-\gl{dir.cp}\\
\glt \qu{bring}
\z 

\subsection{Incorporated object constructions}
\label{ssec:CompV}
\is{Verbs!Incorporated object construction}
\begin{sloppypar}
On top of combining verbs with other verbs, Vamale also forms grammatical words from verbs and non-specific arguments: this includes everyday activities incorporating the most common undergoer, e.g. \textit{xhajake-lait} \qu{eat.starchy-rice} \qu{eat rice}, \textit{xhwi-aman} \qu{eat.proteiny-something} \qu{eat something}, \textit{vai-xam} \qu{weave mats}. This is called ``incorporated object construction" by \citet[357]{ozanne-rivierre_verbal_2004}. There are numerous verbs formed with \textit{vwa} \qu{do}, e.g. \textit{vwa-vaci} \qu{do-pit, hard part}  \qu{to argue}, \textit{vwa-ikin} \qu{do-meaty.side-dish} \qu{to eat tubers with meat}, \textit{vwa-khêt} \qu{do-quarz, blade} \qu{to shave}. All the verbs mentioned form a single stress-contour and cannot be split without losing their overall meaning.
Some nominalized forms can contain complex verbs including a noun, such as \textit{xa-thêên-fe-\textbf{fati}} \qu{\gl{agt}.\gl{nmlz}-run-take-word} \qu{messenger} and \textit{xa-fe-ta-me-\textbf{mapeke}} \qu{\gl{agt}.\gl{nmlz}-take-go.up-\gl{dir.cp}-bright} \qu{morning star}. 
\end{sloppypar}

\section{Nominal derivation}
\label{sec:NomDeriv}
\is{Verbs!Nominalization}
\is{Nominalization}

Vamale derives nouns from verbs either by using nominalizing prefixes or simply by stripping the verb from its subject indices (be they proclitics or suffixes), and preposing an article. The nominalizers (e.g. \textit{e-, xa, hun-}) are analyzed here as prefixes because they directly attach to the root, the article, e.g. \textit{i=} \qu{\gl{def}.\gl{sg}} can only occur before it (\textit{i=xa-xaleke, *xa=i=xaleke}). 
%``Derivation" means that one only needs a subject marker on the stem to make it a verb, but you don't, instead you put a nominalizer, and you have a noun.xx
The resulting nominalized construction can be used as an argument with a verb or a preposition and can be possessed by another nominal phrase. The possessor is not, however, understood to be the agent of the action, as in English (e.g. \qu{my seeing the brother}), except for intransitive verbs. Instead, the possessor denotes the undergoer. %%todo sondern wie wird es verstanden, oder wo sagst du mehr darüber?
%What makes them nominal is the slot. \textit{i=} can attach to it, adjectives can, it can function as an argument to a verb (whereas a verb cannot have a verb as an argument I think).xx
Whether a given verb is nominalized via prefixation or stripping is lexically determined, since nominalizing via stripping is not accepted for some verbs (e.g. \textit{*i thapoke} \qu{the beginning}, or \textit{*i hmanan} \qu{his/her hunger}). Another example is \textit{hun-vwa kan} \qu{manner-do it; the style of doing it, the act of doing it} which cannot be \textit{*vwa kan} or even \textit{*vwa}. Both stripped and prefixed nominalizations may include arguments, as in (\ref{ex:i_jili}), but not TAM markers. 
Stripped nominalizations, contrary to the other de-verbal constructions detailed below, do not express a subject through possessive means, but keep the same strategy as normal verb phrases, i.e. using a noun phrase flagged with \textit{ka} \qu{sbj}: \textit{ka li=apuli} \qu{\gl{sbj} \gl{def}.\gl{pl}=person} in (\ref{ex:i_jili}). There are two relatively neutral prefixes, \textit{ape-X} meaning \qu{fact of doing X}, and \textit{hun-} \qu{manner of doing X}, though \textit{hun-} was the only one readily used by speakers for novel constructions. 

%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item We have \textbf{canonical nouns}, alienably or inalienably possessed.They alone do not constitute a clause. (*\textit{i daahma.}).
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item We have verbs that are nominalized with an obligatory  \textsc{nmlz} prefix when preceded by an article: \textit{i ape-hnyimake-aman} \qu{the fact-think-something; the thought} %(tentatively called "the NOM-needers").
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item \textit{thapoke} \qu{begin}, ambitransitive, must be \textit{ape-thapoke-ka-n} (place-begin-acc-inan) \qu{the moment of beginning} or \textit{hun-thapoke-o/go/a/...} (manner-begin-1\gl{sg}...) \qu{the a{}ct of beginning} (this pattern is the same for all similarly nominalized verbs).
%			\item \textit{vii} \qu{say}, transitive, must carry the prefix \textit{hun-}.
%			\item \textit{moo} \qu{stay} \textbf{intransitive} must be \textit{hun-moo}.
%		\end{itemize}
%		\item We have nominalizations of entire verb phrases. This is still productive and probably an old construction.  like \textit{jili} \qu{build with wood}. They keep their object NPs in the VP. %No possession of objects like in English \textit{the speaking \textbf{of} the word}. 
%		No possession of the resulting construction attested. What works is a complete clause with a \textit{ka} subject nominalized with an article, as shown in \ref{ex:i_jili}.

\subsection{\textit{e}-}
\label{ssec:ins.nmlz}
\is{Nominalization!Instrumental nominalizer}
The instrumental nominalizer \textit{e-} has \textit{fe-} and \textit{ve-} cognates in related Northern languages. It is likely that \textit{v-} was only recently dropped, as the word for \qu{spoon} was only coined in the last 150 years, and is \textit{vetupi} from \textit{tuuvi} \qu{scoop up from liquid} (though a loan from a more archaic dialect is not excluded). The word for \qu{learning} \textit{eca} is still listed as \textit{veca} by Leenhardt (1946) and pronounced that way by Chief Luc. In Nelêmwa, a similar morpheme \textit{-ve-} or \textit{-vi-} depending on animacy \parencite[194]{bril_complex_2004}, comes from \textit{fhe} \qu{take} in Nêlêmwa (\textit{fe} in Vamale), though it is not a nominalizer (\textit{baa-}, \citealt[74]{bril_nelemwa_2002}). Our nominalizer \textit{e-} might have a similar background to Nelêmwa \textit{-ve-}, being derived from \textit{fe} \qu{to take}. Cèmuhî and Paicî use \textit{be-} \qu{\gl{ins}.\gl{nmlz}} \parencites[257]{rivierre_langue_1980}[42]{rivierre_dictionnaire_1983}, versus the reciprocal/middle \textit{pi-} \parencites[257]{rivierre_langue_1980}[363]{rivierre_dictionnaire_1983}.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{e-vwa-tiike} \qu{pen} (lit. \qu{\gl{ins}.\gl{nmlz}-make-write})
	\item \textit{e-xadae-ke} \qu{blessing} (lit. \qu{\gl{ins}.\gl{nmlz}-up.there-\gl{tr}})
	\item \textit{e-vwadi-ya-n} \qu{thumb} (lit. \qu{\gl{ins}.\gl{nmlz}-peel-starchy.food-3\gl{sg}.\gl{poss}})
	\item \textit{e-xhwali-aman} \qu{fork} (lit. \qu{\gl{ins}.\gl{nmlz}-stab-thing})
	\item \textit{e-ja} \qu{scales} (lit. \qu{\gl{ins}.\gl{nmlz}-measure, weigh})
\end{enumerate}

Other items look like nominalizations, but the meaning of the presumed base form is lost: \textit{e-xhaat} \qu{paddle}, \textit{e-thadala} \qu{fruit-picking rod}. 

\subsection{\textit{xa}-}
\label{ssec:agt.nmlz}
\is{Nominalization!Agentive nominalizer}
\textit{Xa-} \qu{\gl{agt}.\gl{nmlz}}, an agentive nominalizer, is probably derived from \textit{xayu} \qu{male}. Since in Vamale, modifiers usually follow the modified, and possessors the possessum, \textit{xa-} may be an old phrase head, now incorporated into the former modifying phrase. The nominalizer may have developed from a noun phrase with an optionally marked relative clause (\ref{ex:xavwatau}), which was gradually reduced to \textit{xay(u) vwa-tau}, and finally to \textit{xa-vwa-tau} \qu{fisherman}.

	\ea \label{ex:xavwatau}
		\gll xayu (a=a=) vwa-tau\\
	 male (\gl{rel}=3\gl{sg}) make-impact\\
	\glt \qu{the man who fishes} (the relativizer \textit{a} is often omitted)
		\z

The morpheme means \qu{one who does regularly, one whose job is X}, the former meaning being used with a habitual meaning on verbs. It can also attach to stative verbs like \textit{xahnang}, but in this case it is a habitual marker (and not a nominalizer), since the verbs can still take subject index marking: \textit{xa-xahnang-go} \qu{you are beautiful, you are a good person}. %See \textit{xada} \qu{your turn} and \sectref{sec:RecipRelations}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{xa-vabun} \qu{thief}
	\item \textit{xa-moo xada Wanaa} \qu{an inhabitant of Wanaa}
	\item	\textit{xa-vap} \qu{hunter}
	\item	\textit{xa-vwa suki} \qu{buyer}
	\item	\textit{xa-fe-ta-me-mapeke} \qu{morning star, light-bringer (lit. \gl{agt}.\gl{nmlz}-take-go.up-\gl{dir.cp}-be.bright)}
\end{itemize}

%Alsoː \textit{xa-da} \textit{xa-hut} \textit{xalan} \qu{under} yo emoo xalan thu, yo emoo Koné. NP?

The habitual meaning can be extended to express whether something has occurred in general, as in (\ref{ex:xa}).

\ea \label{ex:xa}

\gll go=pa xa-ha-me\\
 2\gl{sg}=\gl{prf} \gl{agt}.\gl{nmlz}-go-\gl{dir.cp}\\

\z


A prefix \textit{xa-} is also used in reciprocal kinship terms. They are listed in \Cref{tab:recp_rel1}, and will be mentioned again in \Cref{tab:recp_rel}. For many terms, an (re-)anal\-y\-sis of \textit{xa-} as the agentive prefix makes sense, but cognates in other Northern languages suggest a different origin. Note that \textit{mwaa-n} probably actually means \qu{child-in-law of the opposite sex}. By analogy, \qu{father-in-law and his daughter-in-law} may have been \textit{xa-mwaa-n xayu}, though this word is lost nowadays.

\label{tab:recp_rel1}
\end{table}
     
\subsection{\textit{hun}-}
\label{ssec:hun}
\is{Nominalization!Manner nominalizer}
This nominalizer expresses a manner of doing something. Cognates are \textit{u-} in Nelêmwa and \textit{kae-} or \textit{hun-} in Pije \parencite[253]{haudricourt_dictionnaire_1982}. No etymology is reconstructed yet for either. It often associates with the linker \textit{ka-n} \qu{\gl{link}-\gl{nspec}}. For a description of \textit{-ka-n} \qu{-\gl{link}-\gl{nspec}} see \sectref{kan}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{hun-moo ka-n} \qu{\gl{nmlz}-be \gl{link}-\gl{nspec}} \qu{way of life, nature}
	\item \textit{hun-tiike ka-n} \qu{\gl{nmlz}-write \gl{link}-\gl{nspec}} \qu{orthography}
	\item \textit{hun-thêên ka-n} \qu{\gl{nmlz}-run \gl{link}-\gl{nspec}} \qu{driving style}
\end{itemize}

As with other derivations, whether \textit{hun-} means \qu{style} or \qu{tradition}, or something more idiosyncratic, can depend on the verb. Compare examples (\ref{ex:hun}--\ref{ex:hunvi1}): \textit{moo} \qu{to stay} keeps the same meaning for inanimate and animate subjects (\ref{ex:hun1}, \ref{ex:hunmoo}). However, the derivation of \textit{vii} \qu{to say} takes on an idiosyncratic meaning with inanimate subjects, \qu{its meaning} (\ref{ex:hunvi2}) and it keeps a transparent one with an animate subject: \qu{his/her way of saying} (\ref{ex:hunvi1}).


\ea \label{ex:hun}

	\glt \qu{his/her way of saying it}
	\z
 
Compared to the other nominalizing prefixes, \textit{hun-} is the most neutral one, which casts doubt on the \qu{manner} meaning postulated above. See example (\ref{ex:hunpala}), where a nominalization is used because \textit{goon} \qu{enough} only bears this meaning if it does not subordinate \textit{pala} \qu{talk}. Otherwise, \textit{goon, ma...} would mean \qu{permitted, to...}, as in (\ref{ex:goon_hunpala}). The first example does not mention style, only the bare fact of talking.

\subsection{\textit{ape-}}
\label{ssec:ape}
\is{Nominalization!Locative nominalizer}
The noun \textit{ape-n} \qu{trace-\gl{poss}} seems a probable origin of the locative nominalizer \textit{ape-}.
As can be seen in \Cref{tab:ape}, most of the forms seem to support a locative interpretation, though some are a bit more abstract. Like with other nominalizers, the transitive suffix \textit{-ke}, auxiliary verbs like \textit{vwa}, and other verbal characteristics, do not disappear upon derivation. \textit{Ape-} is also used for the fact of doing something (e.g. \textit{ape-hnyimake-aman} \qu{fact-think-something, i.e. thought}).

\subsection{Nominalized verb phrases}
\label{sec:NmlzVP}
\is{Nominalization!Nominalized verb phrase}
%@fernando thought i'd put it with the other nominalization bits instead of with verb phrases or nouns. what do you think?\\~\\

As well as deriving verbs, Vamale can derive whole verb phrases, the resulting construction being internally a verb phrase with identifiable referents, and externally a noun phrase, that can function as an argument. Consider the Bwatoo example in example (\ref{ex:Bwatoo_derivVP}). Speakers confirmed the acceptability of its Vamale equivalent in (\ref{ex:Vam_derivVP}). In both cases, a ditransitive verb phrase is derived to a noun by dropping the subject marker and adding an article \textit{i=} (or \textit{ani}, in Bwatoo). This is one way to derive a verb phrase, though the nominalizing prefix \textit{hun-} is also commonly used.

%Transitive verbs take objects. Verbs with an article before them continue to take objects. What does this mean about the article as an NP-defining morpheme? \textbf{Hypothesis:} Articles mark NPs, and if the NP after the article is a verb and its object, then this is a nominalized VP (see Fig. \ref{fig:ka2Tree}).

\glt \qu{When giving the gift to them is done,\ldots}
\z

\begin{sloppypar}
Another, more lexicalized approach to nominalizing verb phrases, can be found for established nouns with transparent meanings. Contrary to the constructions discussed above, where the nominalized verb phrase's arguments are nouns with referents, words like \textit{e-topweeke-aman} \qu{hook, lit. \gl{nmlz}.\gl{ins}-hang.up-something}, and \textit{e-xhuli-aman} \qu{medicinal plants, lit. \gl{nmlz}.\gl{ins}-spittle-something} use \textit{aman} \qu{thing}, a semantically vague incorporated noun which is also found in \textit{xhwi-aman} \qu{eat, lit. bite-something}. Note that \textit{aman} changes the stress pattern of the whole construction as would a phonologically integrated morpheme (see \sectref{sec:Stress}), which is why it is hyphenated to the verb here.
\end{sloppypar}

\subsection{Nominalization with \textit{ka-n}}
\label{kan}
\is{ka!Linker \textit{ka} in nominalizations@\textit{ka}}
\is{Nominalization!Linker \textit{ka}}
Deverbal nominalizations may carry the linker \textit{ka-}, with \textit{-n} \qu{\gl{nspec}, \gl{ana}} in generic and anaphoric contexts. \textit{Ka(-n)} follows the nominalized verb to link semantically S/O noun phrases (\ref{ex:ka1}).\footnote{The Pije cognate is \textit{\textbf{-a}-n}, the Cèmuhî one {[tɛ̀]}- \parencite[273]{rivierre_langue_1980}. Note that the optional possessive classifier \textit{ka-} described in \sectref{ssec:ka_CL} has the Cèmuhî cognate {[hɛ̃̀]} \parencite[271]{rivierre_langue_1980}, but may have merged with this linker in Vamale.} It is optional with overt specific noun phrases, see (\ref{ex:noka1}). The distribution of \textit{ka} reflects the animacy of the participants: animate S or O cannot take \textit{ka} if expressed covertly (i.e. through affixes), but may take it optionally if overtly present (i.e. as noun phrases), as in (\ref{ex:ka overt1}). In contrast to this, \textit{ka} is obligatory with covert inanimate, implicit participants (\ref{ex:no_kan}), and \textit{-n} refers to the participant (\ref{ex:n}).

%an \textbf{``it" marker}. It expresses the inanimate \textbf{undergoer} in nominalized verbs. Consider \ref{ex:animate} as an example of animate U, where the \textit{ka} is a subject marker like in \ref{ex:sbj marker}.

\subsubsection{Position of \textit{ka-n}}

\textit{Ka} can either appear directly after the nominalized verb: \textbf{V \textit{ka} Obj} or, resumptively, after the VP: \textbf{V Obj \textit{ka-n} Possessor} (\ref{ex:moving ka}), illustrated as a tree in  \Cref{fig:ka2Tree}. In this tree, \textit{ka} is shown to be \qu{moved} after the argument before the possessor, like in (\ref{ex:moving ka}), but it hosts a resumptive morpheme then: \textit{-n} \qu{\gl{ana}}. This anaphoric use of \textit{-n} also occurs on dependent verbs (\sectref{ssec:active-n}) and prepositions (\sectref{ssec:WCPrepoNouns}). This means that \textit{ka} is not a suffix, since it tolerates a whole noun phrase in between it and the verb root. It also means that \textit{ka}, although likely related to the \gl{S\textsubscript{P}}/\gl{S\textsubscript{A}}-marker, is distinct from the latter, since the \gl{S\textsubscript{P}}/\gl{S\textsubscript{A}}-marker cannot be used resumptively. As \Cref{fig:kaTree} shows, the argument expressed with \textit{ka-n} in a possessed nominalization tends to be repeated as a noun phrase afterwards, maybe for better comprehensibility (short-term memory).

A related, though distinct function \textit{ka-} is that of semantically unspecified, focused possession (see \sectref{ssec:foc_poss_ka} on the possessor classifier). The important distinction lies in the classifier's marked use, whereas the former \textit{ka-} \qu{\gl{link}} is non-marked, though also optional. Both morphemes can function as stand-ins for known or implicit (i.e. non-overt) participants. \textit{Ka} \qu{\gl{link}} is also sensitive to animacy, and can be used resumptively, contrary to the more possessive linker \textit{ka} described in \sectref{ssec:ka_CL}.  %They do not share the same semantics, either

%Furthermore, while the relational classifier \textit{ka}/\textit{k-ong} is able to take a non-specific \textit{-n}, it uses Set I possessive suffixes (see \sectref{ssec:ka_CL}). The optional, focusing possessor classifier \textit{ka}/\textit{ka yo} detailed in \sectref{ssec:foc_poss_ka} uses free pronouns and noun phrases. %This \textit{ka} is thus formally distinct from the classifiers mentioned.

%\footnotetext{there can be several ways, all belonging to one person. is this important? maybe, because if \textit{i} \gl{art} is inside the possessed NP (i hunsaxhutikan - eong), -\textit{eong} is word-external (the way of telling it, of mine). If \textit{i} is outside, -\textit{eong} is word-internal (the, explanation of mine).}

\subsubsection{The role of animacy in \textit{ka-n} nominalizations}
\is{Linker \textit{ka}!Animacy}
\is{Animacy}
In deverbal nominalizations, inanimate S and O are optionally flagged by \textit{ka} \qu{\gl{link}}. Animate S and O can only take \textit{ka} as overt NPs, however.

\ea \label{ex:ka overt}
\gll e=xaleke i=hun-thapi-bwa- i=apuli canbwen	\\
 1\gl{sg}=see \gl{art}=\gl{nmlz}-bash-head- \gl{art}=man yesterday	\\
\glt \qu{I saw the murder of the man yesterday.} (\textit{thapi bwan} is a fixed expression for \qu{killing humans})
\z
 %\textit{i hun-vwa ka i mwa} (inanimate object), \textit{i hun-thapoke ka i vaa} (inanimate subject), \textit{i hunsaxhuti ka i jaxhut} (inanimate object)). S and O are treated the same as long as they are overt, \textit{-kan} being optional but preferred when not overt (\textit{i hunmoo} \qu{the nature [of something implied]}). 
Ambitransitive verbs like \textit{thapoke} \qu{to begin (something)} show that the co\hyp occurrence of \textit{ka-} \qu{\gl{link}} and \textit{ka} \qu{\gl{sbj}} is avoided, and only the most agentive participant is marked: derived transitive verbs with both participants present as noun phrases only mark the agent (\ref{ex:no n2}), and \textit{ka} \qu{\gl{link}} is seen in nominalizations of intransitive verbs (\ref{ex:no n1}) and transitive ones without an overt agent (\ref{ex:no n3}). An overview of this distribution is given in Table \ref{tab:ka}, with examples below (\ref{ex:no n2}--\ref{ex:ka-itr-an-ov}).
%Since animate subjects are either obligatorily marked \textit{ka} if transitive, or not necessarily \textit{ka} but like O if intransitive, there again we have a S/O vs A split.

%\textit{moo} \qu{to stay (at); to be} is intransitive. The forms for animate and inanimate subjects are not the same. Consider \textit{hun-moo-\textbf{kan}} \qu{nature} for inanimates and \textit{hun-moo-\textbf{o/go/a}...} \qu{character, way of being} for animates. Maybe \textit{kan} comes from \gl{sbj} and \textit{-n} is the inanimate placeholder, and over time has been reanalyzed? 


%\subsubsection{Different types:}

%\textit{ka} appears with \textit{-n} marked inanimate arguments, transitivity plays no role. Overt inanimate arguments (S or P) can be marked with \textit{ka}, ideally if there is no transitive subject marker \textit{ka} \qu{\gl{a}}. Animacy is important, animate S/O are not marked with \textit{ka}.

%Is the presence of \textit{ka} a question of transitivity? For instance, ex. \ref{a ka yo} \textit{i hun-xale-a ka yo} \qu{her being seen by me}, if it follows the same pattern as ex. \ref{ex:hunmoo} \textit{hun-moo-a} \qu{her character}, might need \textit{ka} because otherwise any animate argument, like \textit{-a} in this case, would be a candidate for the agent. But there is ex. \ref{ex:ka-tr-inan-ov} \textit{i hun saxhuti i jaxhut-eong} \qu{the way of telling my story}. It thus probably follows another pattern, tentatively summarized in Table \ref{tab:ka} below.
