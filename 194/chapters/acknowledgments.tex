\addchap{Acknowledgements}


This book began as my PhD thesis; I would therefore like to express my sincerest gratitude to my supervisor, Gert De Sutter, my co-supervisor, Koen Plevoets, and the members of my doctoral advisory committee Sandra Halverson, Dagmar Divjak and Els Lefever. I would also like to thank the Hogeschool Onderzoeksfonds, who funded the research to begin with, and Ghent University to provide me with the necessary research facilities to continue my research.



I would like to thank my colleagues Alexandra, Annelore, Bert, Chloé, Christophe, Isabelle, Katrien, Kristien, Lynn, Pauline, Peter, Sevdag, Sofie, Stefaan and a special \textit{merci} to Désirée. I could not have finished this work without the loving support of my friends and extended family Ann, Caroline, Christina, Irene, Elisa, Jasper, Sylvie, Bjoke, Evy, An-Sofie, Camille, Ruben, Chen, Lieve, Jan, Valérie, Anne and Francis. A special thank you to my sweet sister and brother-in-law.



I want to thank my parents, who gave me the precious freedom to study whatever I wanted, for as long as I wanted to (little did they know).
