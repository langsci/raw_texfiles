	shorttitle = {Adversative discourse markers in contrast: The need for a combined corpus approach},
	abstract = {This paper deals with the semantics of two discourse markers, viz. French en fait (“in fact”) and Dutch eigenlijk (“actually”), commonly associated with the expression of “opposition” and “reformulation”. A special focus lies on methodological issues in the description of such markers, since their non-propositional meanings seem to require what is called a ‘combined corpus approach’, including written and spoken comparable data as well as translation corpora. It is argued that eigenlijk and en fait are best described as adversatives, at the intersection of “opposition” and “reformulation” which constitute their basic meanings, and from which other meanings such as “causality”, “counterexpectation”, “enhancement” and “attenuation” can be inferred. Evidence from all sets of corpora moreover suggests that it is the semantic underspecification of en fait and (especially) eigenlijk which ultimately accounts for their high level of polysemy.

	abstract = {The article presents an analysis of the periphrastic expression of continuative aspect by taking into account Dutch blijven + Vinf and French continuer à + Vinf. As prototypical marks of continuation, or the middle phase of an event, they will be argued to constitute the core of a formal field of equivalent expressions and of a semantic field intersecting with other meanings, including spatiality, stativity, iteration and counter-expectation. The lack of substantial research into continuative aspect motivates a semasiological approach making use of translation data which, although potentially controversial, will be shown to be a highly effective heuristic for formal and semantic equivalence in linguistic phenomena. A quantitative outset will be combined with qualitative analyses of synchronic data, resulting in an outline of potential pathways of grammaticalization and, potentially, subjectification.

	shorttitle = {A model and a methodology for the study of pragmatic markers: the semantic field of expectation},
	abstract = {In this article, a model and a methodology are proposed for the study of pragmatic markers. The proposal not only contributes to the theoretical discussion but also has advantages from a descriptive point of view. As to the model, it draws on a number of notions which so far have not been brought together in a way which gives a satisfactory explanation for the existence and functioning of pragmatic markers. These notions, reflexivity and indexicality, are integrated here with a view of modality and evidentiality which, based on White (2003), goes beyond truth-functional accounts in its heteroglossic and rhetorical perspectives. From a methodological point of view, the article proposes the use of translations as a heuristic device for setting up lexical fields. Following Dyvik (in press), translation corpora are used to refine the descriptions of semantic and pragmatic relations between items in the same field. To illustrate the methodology, we have opted for the semantic field of ‘expectation’ in English, and we look at equivalents of the pragmatic markers in Swedish and in Dutch.
