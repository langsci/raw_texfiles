\addchap{Preface}
\begin{refsection}
This book originated as the proceedings of a workshop held at the 51st Annual Meeting of the Societas Linguistica Europaea (SLE) in Tallinn (see \citealt{HÃ¶lzlPayne2018}). For reasons beyond our control, the volume has been delayed for some time and we are grateful to \name{Martin}{Haspelmath} and Language Science Press for this opportunity. The volume is now an independent publication with some chapters having been presented at the workshop and some being later additions. We are happy to present a volume that covers all branches of Tungusic, several endangered languages (e.g., \ili{Even}, \ili{Evenki}, \ili{Sibe}), and includes fresh first-hand data from the very last speakers of several moribund languages (e.g., \ili{Negidal}, \ili{Oroch}, \ili{Udihe}, \ili{Uilta}). We hope that this book can contribute to the documentation of these languages. We are especially grateful that this is an open access publication that will make the data freely available to all scholars.
