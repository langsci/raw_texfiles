\emph{New research on circum-Caribbean creoles and language contact} is
a project that started with papers presented at the Society of Pidgin
and Creole Languages summer conference of 2017, hosted by the
Universities of Tampere and Turku.

Its progress was delayed at times by obstacles such as the Covid-19
pandemic and the reorganization of teaching, research, and everyday life
that resulted from it.

Consequently, we feel enormous gratitude towards the authors of the
papers in this volume. Throughout the process, their faith in it was
unwavering and their patience went even further.

This volume could not have been completed without the generous
assistance of fourteen anonymous reviewers from a geographic area that
extends from Haiti, Brazil, and the United States, to Finland, as well
as the mentors the authors have cited in their individual
acknowledgments.

We would like to thank Maria Pesola-Gallone for initial formatting and
Felix Kopecky for final typesetting as well as the Society for Caribbean
Linguistics for partial funding of the associated costs.

Most importantly, we express our gratitude to Language Science Press in
general, and first and foremost to Joseph T. Farquharson, Chief Editor
of the \emph{Studies in Caribbean Languages} series.\bigskip\\
