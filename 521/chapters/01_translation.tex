This is a story, about how the moon came into being. This is what I want to tell. Once upon a time, a lady was living with her brother. They went to find sago, they went to the sago place in the forest. They went there and they made sago.

The next day, they got up. They fell the tree and then chopped sago. So they chopped it and they continued to do so until the evening and then they collected all the sago they made and went home to sleep.

They slept and on the next day, they went there again. They did so until the third day. Then her brother said, ``Sister! Since we are eating only sago all day, I want to go downstream to find some fish.'' After that he took some arrows made of splintered ribs of sago leaves and a bow, and went to find some fish down there. While walking, he was looking out for fish. So he got some fish, brought them home and cooked them. He cooked a lot and partly ate from it himself but kept something for his sister. 

In the evening, she came back from the sago place and saw that he had taken some of the sago and cooked it. ``Hey you, from where did you take the sago you cooked here?'', she asked him and her brother answered: ``Oh! It was from that sago we made. There is also fish for you. It is our dinner!'' - ``Huh!? We cannot eat that sago!'', she scolded, ``Your brother-in-law went to Awin. He went to the market. Let him come as well, then we can eat the sago. We always eat sago together so we cannot eat the sago now.'' Having said that, her brother called out: "Oh my goodness! What shall we have with the fish then? We certainly cannot eat dirt. Since we just made sago, we must eat from that sago." But all this talk was only in his mind, he did not dare to speak out to his sister. So he kept his thoughts for himself.

At the next morning, they went to make sago again. He opened the stem, chopped it and left it for her. Then he went to find fish like the day before. As he walked, he remembered her talk from the evening before. She talked to him like that: ``Tomorrow, you will not cook and eat the sago. Instead, you shall make the sago pulp. You only cook the pulp and eat the fish.'' - ``Oh my goodness, alright'', he said.
Since she turned to him and explicitly forbade him to eat it, he left the sago. He brought the fish in the late afternoon. He went out and killed some fish and brought them home, where he cooked them in the sago pulp. When he was done, he had his meal. He took out the pulp of the sago and only ate from the meat of the fish. Then he made the other fish and kept it for his sister.

When his sister finished the work with the sago in the evening, she took off home. She came home to her brother and asked him: ``So, how was your trip?'' - ``Oh, that's what I have brought and kept for you. I cooked it with the sago pulp, so that's it'', he said. She prepared the food by taking out the sago pulp and threw it away. And then she ate the fish with some fresh sago. But her brother was stunned, since he had eaten only from the sago pulp. After dinner, he went to sleep. His thoughts kept him awake all night: ``Oh my goodness, what shall I do? We make the sago to eat, so we must eat the sago, oh!'' He thought over and over like that. At the next morning he said, ``Sister! Let us eat the sago today. If we keep on waiting for my brother-in-law, it will be too long. So can we just eat the sago?'' But she just refused: ``My brother, we cannot eat the sago. Let the brother-in-law who went to Awin region come back first.'' He agreed and then he started to make plans.

He had to do something. What he went for was some sort of thorns. Some sort of thorns, and bees, and sharp objects and more like that. He brought all sorts of rough items and he wrapped them. He wrapped it into a big, rough thing. He made a huge package of that and he took it and climbed on a tree. He took it onto a tree where he arranged everything. He hung it up there quite well. It was up there and should be part of his revenge. He did not care for his sister anymore, just because of the sago. 

He climbed and arranged everything and it was high up there on the tree. Then he covered his eyes but nothing happened. There was nothing near him, everything was far away from up the tree there. Then he stuck out his tongue. When he stuck out the tongue, the sky was suddenly coming closer. He recognised that this way, he could make it come closer. It was good to know and he thought: ``What will I do with that?'' Finally, he went home.

He went home and his sister came later. When she came at night, he told her: ``Hey sister! Guess what, I have seen a big bird's nest. It was huge. So we will go to kill the bird. I will drop it with its nest'', he said. - ``Oh, my brother, alright. We can go and get it. This will be good, since we made sago lately.'' So they first took some torches, one for the sister and one for the her brother. They walked until they arrived at the tree that had been prepared with the fake nest. ``Sister, you keep standing here! I am going to climb'', he said. And immediately, he climbed the tree. He climbed, and climbed, and climbed, until he arrived at the nest. Then he shouted down to her: ``Sister, where exactly are you standing?'' - ``I am right here, my brother!'' - ``Just come a little closer!'' He directed her right under the nest, so that when he would drop it, it would hit her. She moved according to his directions: ``Alright, here is where I stand.'' - ``Yes, just stay there! I want to pick up and drop the nest now. You just keep standing there'', he shouted. And finally, as she was standing there, he picked up and dropped that huge nest. He dropped the nest that he made, it went down and hit his sister hard. It broke at her body and all the thorns inside, the bees and all the bad things he loaded it with fell exactly on her. It hit her pretty hard. Then he stuck out his tongue and as the moon came closer, he climbed onto it. He changed from the land to the sky, so he got onto it and became one with the moon soon. He just merged with the moon and so it stayed.

As for the sister, after the nest had hit her, she said: ``What was that? How could that happen?'' She was looking around but did not get any answer. Her brother was quiet, everything was quiet. He did not come down to help her. So from that time on, he had become the moon. "The moon is now much brighter than before, oh, maybe my brother has joined the moon?", she said. She said this and then she went back home crying. Still crying, she arrived at home: ``Oh goodness, he is my younger brother!'' She was missing him badly and just kept sitting there. Finally, she fell asleep.

The next morning, her husband who had gone to Awin came back. As he came, he was looking all around. He kept looking around but did not find the other man. She was alone inside the house. ``But where is my brother-in-law?'', he asked. - ``Oh, the brother-in-law! It is a long story. It has to do with the sago. Since you went off to the Awin region, we would wait with eating the sago until you return'', she said. ``That's what I wanted. He went to catch fish and hunt other things and he was cooking it with the sago pulp. And then it was like this: He did something to deceive me. There were all kinds of thorns, bees and similar things, and a nest. It was a fake bird's nest. He lied about it and he went to a tree. He hung it at the tree and dropped it to hit me. And when he had done all that he flew out to become the moon!'' As she told her husband everything like that, he cried out for his brother-in-law. He cried for his brother-in-law and he was very emotional. Then he picked up a stone adze and he killed her. After killing her, he cut her in two halves.

The man had cut her wife in two halves. The story concludes like that: So one half turned into a beetle, the other into a spider. The beetle went into the soil immediately. The spider made a nest. And this nest is an imitation of the bird's nest that hit the woman. From then on, spiders kept making nests. But as for the beetle, it lives in the ground. Only when the moon shines, it wants to come out. In the evening, when there is the moon, it wants to come out and it makes a buzzing sound: ``Olololok!'' When we hear that, the moon is about to come out.

The man who had killed his wife took a stone axe, cut a termite hill open and went inside. He finally turned into a bird, a Kookaburra bird. He became the Kookaburra bird and from then on when the moon comes out, this bird usually cries out. He keeps saying ``Baat totenek'', which means ``the brother-in-law is coming''. He keeps crying out like that. That is the story about the origin of the moon. It was a story of our ancestors.
