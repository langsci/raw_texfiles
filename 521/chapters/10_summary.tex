This story describes an experience between the narrator and his brother Lukas at the Wolok estuary. While Lukas harvested peanuts, the narrator played around, occasionally throwing sand at Lukas. During one playful moment, the narrator discovered a Muying rat's nest among the peanut plants. Encouraged by Lukas, he reached into the nest but was bitten by the rat, causing his hand to bleed. While Lukas found it amusing, the narrator returned home crying.
