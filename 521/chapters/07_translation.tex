Yes, this is about when we were looking for Nik fruits. I want to tell about what happened when we wanted to find some of them.

Okay, so we went for Nik fruits. Brother Lukas, Agus, and myself, we were walking to the forest house. The forest down at the Oga river. We went on until we arrived at the road leading to the river. We took that road and made plans. ``One man shall go this way and the other shall go that way'', we decided. - ``Yes, you go that way'', I said.
``I go that way.'' Thus I went on. Walking ahead, I suddenly recognized some movements over there in the bushes. So I pumped air in my gun and approached the spot. As I went uphill, I saw something was shaking. I thought maybe the other guy passed there. But I as looked, I recognized that it was not the other man. A cassowary had passed just here. So I sat down there quietly and put off my boots. I had my long boots with me. So now I put them off and looked for a tree. At which tree could I hide?

Walking and looking, I noticed a suitable tree. I stood at that tree and tried to spot the cassowary. Where did it go? Oh, it was standing up there. It was standing up there, so I kept quiet. And I shot directly. I shot at it but I thought the bullet did not hit it. ``Where will it go?'', I thought and watched. I held on to the tree, so I could climb it just in case. If the bullet hit it, it would think: ``Where is the human who shoot at me?'' and it would come after me.

I was standing there and watched, but the cassowary made no sign of running away. I was watching and suddenly the little trees over there were also budging. They were budging so, ``Hey! What was that?'' I was watching and then I realized that the cassowary it had fallen over was wriggling on the ground. It was wriggling and then stopped. It's head stuck in some roots of rattans. I went up there quietly and looked at it: ``Oh, the head is all in rattan. It has put its head in the bottom of the rattan. It must be dead.'' And again I shot one bullet at it. It was dead, and I said: ``Yes, you stay down there!'' Then I went to brother Lukas. There were two (guys), I went to find them. I was looking for them and when I found brother Lukas, he was amidst of setting a fishnet in the Oga river. He was trying to set it there and before going there, I put a feather on my head which I had taken from the dead cassowary. I came closer and stood still while he was setting the fishnet. I wanted to fool him. ``Oh, friend! On my way I met an old woman who was lying there dead'', I said. ``Maybe she died while looking for Nik fruits.'' - ``Oh, come on'', he responded in disbelief. - ``It's true'', I said. - ``You are lying!'' - ``No, I am not!'', I insisted. ``She was looking for Nik fruits and now she is dead.'' - ``Who is it?'', he asked. - ``I do not know. I did not see the face well. Let's go and check.'', I said. - ``Oh, we'll walk right into trouble. Come on, couldn't you have died earlier?'', he said.

After this talk, he began to untie the fishing net. ``Just leave it like that'', I said. ``Just leave it. We'll come to take it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.'' - ``No, we cannot do that. We need to bring the news to the village, so let me untie it'', he said. - ``Ah, just leave it like that'', I said. I was laughing and from that Lukas recognized the hoax. He said: ``It must be meat.'' - ``Yes, it is'', I acknowledged. ``It was a cassowary and I shot it.'' - ``Oh yes, if so, let's call the other guy'', he said. The other guy was looking for Nik fruit over there, we decided to call him. Brother Lukas came up from the river and we called for Agus. We called him to come and we wanted to fool him too. Here is how we did it. ``The cassowary is lying in that direction.'' I had passed quite a distance. The two of them should go up to where the cassowary was lying. I took a detour in order to surprise the other guy. They went on until they saw traces. ``Oh, what trace is this?'' They were surprised. Then they saw, there was a cassowary lying there! ``Oh, maybe this is what made the traces'', they thought but the cassowary was just lying there. The other guy quickly took the cassowary on his shoulders. He carried it and came to the river. We put it in the Oga river. First, we tied it with a rope and then put it down and left it lying there. Then we went away to find some Nik fruits. We looked for it at the crest and crossed a river, and crossed it again at another crest. We crossed the river to find them on another crest. But there was almost nothing, we only got a few. ``If it's like that, let's go back'', we said. And we came back.

We came back to the cassowary and took out its feathers. We pulled them all out but the cassowary had become cold and our hands were aching. We pulled out the feathers with our bare hands and it was very painful. Somehow we managed to pull out all the feathers this way and then, still at the river side, brother Lukas sliced it. He sliced it, put down the slices and took them to the other man. He took the slices of meat and put some of them in the bag of the other guy and some into my bag. Then we quickly went up to the high land and while walking we became hungry, so brother Lukas said: ``Let's cook some sago to eat!'' We agreed and went around collecting fire wood and some dried palm leaves and then we made a fire. The fire flared up and we baked the sago. When it was done we took it out and ate a lot.

``Oh, we cannot eat sago only, come on! There is meat. Let's roast a small piece!'' - He took and roasted it. While he roasted it, the other man said: ``Oh, It's harmful to me. I will not eat it.'' And so he did not eat. Only brother Lukas and me ate from it. After we ate a lot, we drank water and finally we moved on. We came to the big road,
we arrived at the big road and then we went on to the village quickly.
We did like that.
