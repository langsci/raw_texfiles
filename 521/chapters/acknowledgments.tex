I thank the Muyu people, who generously welcomed me into their community and taught me their language. This book would not have been possible without the extraordinary patience of my teacher and friend, Yakobus ``Jack'' Wonam.

I especially wish to pay tribute to the six narrators featured in this book: Yakobus Wonam, Patrisius Enip, Adrianus Yamuk, Xaverius Kerenjop, Galus Kolop, and Lukas Autet. Each of them generously shared their stories and patiently sat through long recording sessions.

I would also like to thank Christian Döhler for his excellent guidance throughout the entire process of editing and publishing, as well as Sebastian Nordhoff for his unfailing technical support. Two anonymous reviewers contributed greatly to the quality of this book, and I deeply appreciate their detailed suggestions.
