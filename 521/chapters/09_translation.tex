This is about me, mother, Yamuk, and all our friends - we went to the estuary of Wolok river on the road. I want to tell about the one time when my mother saw a big rat and we caught and killed it.

Our group prepared at our house in the village. Mama Kenmo got ready and so we all went to the Wolok estuary. When we came to Ninikaba, we just went on until we were almost at the Wolok estaury. Mom said, ``Sons, you keep going all along the road. I'll go to check the places where the Benem rats usually hide. I want to check that first.'' After she said that, I, brother Yamuk, and our friends Abraham, Agus, and Galus went on as we were told. Galus was a little boy at that time. We just kept on walking, when suddenly mom called. She was calling my name, so I replied, ``What's the matter?'' - ``Come here! Let us kill a Benem rat'', she replied. After she said that, brother Yamuk and I were running to her. We went to the place where mother was trying to hold and kill the rat and there we met her.

When we went to met her there, we saw that she was right. The rat was in the aerial root of a tree. It had made a nest and stayed there. It stayed like that, so mom put her hand in the aerial root from one side then she reached in from the other side of the aerial root. Like that she had tried to catch and kill it but it was too hard, so she called for us. As we arrived, mother said: ``You son, put in your hand from one side of the aerial root. And Yamuk needs to put in his hand from the other side of the aerial root.'' She said that and so we did. I came from one side of the big aerial root, put in my hand and reached to mother's thumb. So I held mother's thumb and tried to break it. But mother wanted to pull out her hand. I thought I was holding the snout of the rat, while I actually was trying to break mother's thumb. And mother kept trying to pull her hand out. As she struggled to pull it out, I thought the rat was moving. So I held on to mother's thumb strongly, I held it and tried to break it. And
mother still tried to pull her hand out but it was too difficult. She said: ``Children, that's my hand there, who is holding on to it?'' When she said that, I answered: ``Mom, maybe it is me.'' - Then she told me: ``Just try to grab it again.''

I grabbed it and thought the finger was the snout of the rat, so I tried to break it. ``Oh son, you are trying to break my hand'', she said, ``Ouch!'' We did like that.
