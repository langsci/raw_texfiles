This story is about two sisters who got lost in the forest while they were collecting vines and fruit for a party in the village. After wandering around aimlessly, they eventually found a garden with ripe pandanus fruit. While they were eating the fruit, the owner of the garden approached and wanted to scare them away.

Deeply frightened the sisters fled up the tree. However, while the first sister reached a high branch, the second sister stepped on a weak branch and fell down to the ground. Suddenly they transformed into birds to escape. The sister on the tree turned into a crowned pigeon, while the sister on the ground became a cassowary.
