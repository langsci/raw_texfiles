This story is about parents who denied their children access to the sago they stored in their house. The children formed certain body parts from natrual resources and eventually turned into different kinds of bats.

The bats were hanging from the ceiling and flying around in the house, making a mess with the stored sago. When the parents came home, the bats flew out and never returned.

At the end of the story, the narrator tells about the taboo of eating sago before hunting bats. This food taboo is deeply linked with this story.
