The story tells about a man who took his dogs on hunting trips in the forest. One day the dogs took revenge for only being fed the bad parts of the prey. They killed him and threw his severed head into the river.

When his wife found the head, she burried it near the river. Eventually, the first coconut tree grew from this head. The fruit fell into the river and got carried away, so that the coconut tree spread all over the area.
