This is a hunting story. The narrator and his friends, Lukas and Agus, went to the forest near the Oga River to search for Nik fruits. They split up, and the narrator shot a cassowary, took a feather, and played a prank on Lukas by pretending he had found a dead woman. After revealing the joke, Lukas and Agus retrieved the cassowary, kept it fresh in the river, and resumed searching for fruits. Finding few, they butchered the bird, shared the meat, and cooked a meal by the riverside. After eating, they returned to the village.
