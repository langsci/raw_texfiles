This one is about brother Lukas and me. It's a story about a Muying rat that made a nest to stay in and when I cought it, it bit my hand.

We stayed at the Wolok estuary and brother Lukas planted his peanuts. It was a very big patch of peanuts that he planted. He had planted them and waited until they were ready. ``The peanuts are becoming old already'', he said, so he harvested them.

Our father also planted his own peanuts. He had a very big peanut garden. It was like that and brother Lukas harvested his peanuts in round patches, like islands, and left them. He made some further ``islands'' and left them. He always did like that until he would finish harvesting. He would harvest them by going around pulling them out and forming patches like islands. He would go on until the last one. He always left one of these ``islands''.

I used to come to play with him while he was harvesting. I came to the place and took some clumps of sand from the ground and threw them to hit him.  He would try to hit me back but I usually ran away and then he would sit down again calmly and harvest his peanuts. And again I would come to throw something and hit him. The two of us used to play like that.

One day we were playing like that and I came closer to my brother. ``Brother, please don't be angry at me.'' I thought I was disturbing him and when I came closer to him, I saw that there was a rat's nest inside the soil where he harvested peanuts and made these little ``islands''. The nest of a Muying rat. I went on, went closer and checked it well, ``Oh, it is a rat's nest! This Muying rat's nest is new! There must be a rat in here''. I thought like that and I called my brother and told him. ``Brother, maybe there is a rat in here'', I said. When I said that, he responded: ``Try and catch it!'' I went closer and hesitated if I should catch it or not. While I was still hesitating, I tried to touch it with my foot. ``Oh, I cannot go on like that, there must be a rat'', and then I tried it with my hand. It was true, there was a Muying rat in it. A Muying rat and even its offspring stayed in there. I held the nest of the rat and then it bit my hand, so that I bled strongly and brother Lukas laughed at me. He laughed at me and I just went back home crying. We did like that.
