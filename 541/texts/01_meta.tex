\textit{Baet bo llan a allame de tubutubu gogon} is a narrative archived in \citet{Lindsey2015a} and can be cited as \citet[WE\_PN001]{Kidarga2016}. It was submitted to the collection in written form by \name{Minong}{Kidarga} of Limol village in 2016 to be included in a book for the Limol Elementary School. It was edited by \WKS{}, \TTW{}, and \KLL{}. Editing involved rewriting the text with a standardized orthography and light editing to word choice, word order, or style. After editing, \KLL{} recorded \TTW{} reading the text aloud and later retelling the story from memory using a Zoom H4 recorder and head-mounted microphone. These recordings are archived in the collection as \citet{Warama2016a} and \citet{Warama2016b}, respectively. \WKS{}, \TTW{}, \KLL{}, and other members of the Ende Language Committee transcribed these recordings and translated all three texts at the phrase level. After this, \KLL{} imported the texts into the Ende FLEx database and translated them at the morpheme level with help from \CAS{} and various Ende Language Committee members.

The illustrations accompanying the story in Section A.3 were drawn by \name{Kiplin}{Geoff} for inclusion in the book titled \textit{Pepeb Peba (Folk Stories)} assembled by \citet{Johnson2016a}.
