The \textit{Yu ingong} `Fire dance' story was originally told by \WGGfull{} in August 2016 while the Ende Language Committee was gathering stories for an Old Ways book \citep{Johnson2016} to have at the local elementary school \citep{Geser2016}. This recording was transcribed, translated, and edited into a written version for the storybook \citep{Geser2016a}. After it was written down, \name{Sam}{Karao} and \TTW{} read the text out loud for the corpus \citep{Karao2016a,Warama2016z}. \AKDfull{} illustrated the version in the Old Ways book, and those illustrations are included here as well.
