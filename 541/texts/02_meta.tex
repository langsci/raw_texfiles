\textit{Kottllam bo pallall ttoenttoen} `Turtle's story' is a \textit{pourquoi} story told by \TTWfull{} for inclusion in a compilation of children's stories for the Limol Elementary School called \textit{Pepeb Peba (Folk Stories)} (\cite{Johnson2016}). \TTW{} first told the story to \DLJ{} on October 9, 2016 (4.6 minutes; \cite{Warama2016q}), retold it to \KLL{} on October 29, 2016 (7.3 minutes; \cite{Warama2016k}), helped us write it down for \textit{Pepeb Peba} (\cite{Warama2016}), and then read that version aloud later that day (\cite{Warama2016p}). All four texts were transcribed, translated, and put into the Ende FLEx corpus, where they were further translated at the word and morpheme level by \KLL{}, with the help of \CAS{}, \WKS{}, and \TTW{}. The written version \citep{Warama2016} is printed below with the original illustrations by \AKD{} from the \textit{Pepeb Peba} book.
