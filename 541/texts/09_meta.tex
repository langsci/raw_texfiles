This children's song was contributed to the Ende language corpus in 2016 by \name{Julia}{Tätän (Delema)}, a ten-year-old resident of Limol. This song, about a fish who breaks a woman's fishing line, is sung by young girls on fishing trips or when spending time together. Other songs in this genre include songs about birds sitting in trees, people going to wash, and animals spending time together. Sometimes these ditties are accompanied by gestures or string games (see, \textit{e.g.}, \citealt{Claassen2024}). You can listen to J. Tätän (Delema) sing this song in the Ende language corpus \citep{Taetaen2016}.
