The song \textit{Ause Ur} is a children's song about an old woman named Ur, the mother of \name{Kidarga}{Nakllae$^\dagger$}, who was, at the time of recording, one of the oldest men in the village. In the song, the child asks Ur for her last cigarette, and Ur's response seems to indicate that she was a generous figure in the village. Tobacco is grown in the village, and generosity is common, but I did not personally observe any children smoking while I lived there. In the text, we can observe some instances of the benefactive \textit{ngämlle} `for me' (Line 2), the malefactive \textit{ngämlle} `on me' (Line 3), ablative possession \textit{bänene} `that which used to be yours, or came from you' (Line 4), and associated motion \textit{yazgi} `wrap and bring' (Line 2). This song was contributed by \name{Samuel}{Jerry}, the son of \JJD{} and neighbor to K. Nakllae$^\dagger$\ia{Nakllae$^\dagger$, Kidarga}. You can hear S. Jerry sing this song in the Ende language corpus \citep{Jerry2016e}.
