This text is called \textit{Iddob käbama ibiatt} or Night Hunting.\is{hunting} It was initially written by \SKSfull{} around 2007 for inclusion in a literacy primer developed to showcase the Ende orthography at that time. In 2015, \KLL{} and the Ende Language Committee updated the text to the latest spelling system and translated it into \ili{English} (\cite{Kurupel2007}). In 2017, \KLL{} asked \SKS{} to retell the story from memory. This recording is available in the Ende language corpus (\cite{Kurupel2017a}). There is also a recording of \KDDfull{} reading the written text out loud (\cite{Dobola2017}).
