This story, called \textit{Tawa mamoeatt ttoen} `Swamp hunting\is{hunting} story' is a personal narrative told by \JBDfull{} about a time he went hunting for deer with his son. \JBD{} wrote this story in 2007 for inclusion in a primer designed to illustrate a new spelling system for Ende (\cite{Bendanipa2007}). In 2017, \KLL{} edited the text to adhere to the updated \isi{orthography} for inclusion in an illustrated collection of hunting stories for the elementary school (\cite{Reed2017a}). At that time, we also audio-recorded \JBD{} reading the story out loud and retelling it from memory. These recordings are archived in \citet{Lindsey2015b} as \citet{Bendanipa2017a} and \citet{Bendanipa2017b}, respectively.
