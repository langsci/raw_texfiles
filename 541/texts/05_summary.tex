In this text, \SKS{} tells a tale about how he went hunting\is{hunting} one night, shot a deer, and was chased home by a bright light, which locals call a ``ball plane" in \ili{English}. There are many such stories in the Ende corpus about night hunting and ball planes. Generally, Limol residents do not move around after dark because of the lack of light and the chance of encountering dangerous animals. Night hunting is more frequent during full moons and when hunters can access battery-operated torches (flashlights) or solar-powered lanterns. Stories of ball plane encounters occur frequently at night and usually include descriptions of a low-flying, silent, spherical craft with a bright shining light that follows travelers. Sometimes these ball planes have people inside, often with light skin. Many in the community believe that if these ball planes were to catch them, the people inside would take their hearts and kill them. Others believe that they are trying to sell them weapons. Either way, people are afraid of them and will run back to the village in fear, often hurting themselves along the way by tripping and falling on the uneven walking paths. These stories were always presented to me as true and were never compared to the Western folk beliefs of aliens or UFOs. I have been asked multiple times to do something about these ball planes, specifically to ask that they stop scaring the Ende villagers.

After \SKS{} returns home, he takes a group of men with him the following day to collect the slain deer. This is common practice, especially when the animal is too large for one man to carry (see \figref{fig:hunting-deer}).\is{hunting} The group of men will share the deer with their families, with the hunter taking the most prized cuts of meat. When \is{possession} possessions like slain animals, fallen trees, sago\is{flora!\textit{Metroxylon sagu} (Sago)} bundles, or other heavy items are left on the road, a mark is left on the bundle called \textit{tab}. This \textit{tab} can be a part of a plant or animal that is connected to the person's clan group,\is{clan} or even a simple branch on top that indicates “I am coming back for this."
