The following narrative is called \textit{Donae Kurupel bäne käza gäzatt ttoen} or `Donae Kurupel's crocodile killing story.' It is a true story told by \DKSfull{} about a noteworthy fishing\is{fishing} day with \SSSfull{}.

\DKS{} told this story to \LWR{} in 2017 for inclusion in a book for the elementary school on fishing\is{fishing} stories (\cite{Reed2017}). \LWR{} recorded \DKS{} using a Zoom H4N audio recorder and a head-mounted microphone while she told this 9.4-minute long story. This recording is archived in the Ende language corpus as \citet{Kurupel2017}. After recording, \LWR{} and \WKS{} transcribed the story into standard Ende and translated it at the phrase-level. \TTW{} and \KLL{} translated the text at the word- and morpheme-levels. The text was lightly edited for style and structure for inclusion in the fishing story book. This edited version at 375 words long is presented here and is archived in the Ende language corpus as \citet{Kurupel2017b}. This published version is accompanied by illustrations drawn by 16-year-old \name{Keith}{Mado}.
