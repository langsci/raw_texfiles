\textit{Auma we ibiatt ttoen} is an original story told by \WKSfull{} in 2017. Two oral tellings and one written version are archived in \citet{Lindsey2015b}. The story was first told to and recorded by \KLL{} (\cite{Kurupelsuwede2017g}). The telling elicited so much laughter that it was retold to and recorded by \LWR{} (\cite{Kurupelsuwede2017e}). \KLL{} and \LWR{} worked with \WKS{} and \TTW{} to transcribe and translate the two spontaneous recordings of the narrative. The two narratives were then combined and edited to produce the written version included here (\cite{Kurupelsuwede2017k}). Light editing involved rewriting the text with a standardized orthography and inserting content for clarity.
