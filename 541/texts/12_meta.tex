This text called \textit{Bundae bo pepeb} `Bundae's story,' is a parable that was written down by \JJDfull{} and illustrated by \WKSfull{} in 2016 for inclusion in a collection of children's stories called \textit{Pepeb peba} `Storybook' \citep{Johnson2016a}. After it was written down, the text was edited by \TTW{}, \WKS{} and \KLL{} for standardization in spelling and punctuation (\cite{Dareda2016d}). Later, \CAS{} recorded \JJD{} reading the written version out loud (\cite{Dareda2016}) and retelling the story from memory (\cite{Dareda2016a}).
