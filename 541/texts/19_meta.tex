\textit{Ttongo toto me, yäbäd a goklanän} is a children's song about girls having fun at \textit{Iräm} washing place at the end of the day (see \figref{fig:girls-washing}). When this song is sung, everyone shakes their bum on the third line, which elicits much laughter. This song was contributed to the Ende language corpus twice, once by \name{Jordan}{Dobola} \citep{Dobola2016g} and once by \name{Ibetty}{Kenny} \citep{Kenny2016}. Both performances are available in the archive.
