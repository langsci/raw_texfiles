\textit{Iräm ine, Iräm ine} 'Ode to Iräm waters' is an ode written by \WBBfull{} prior to 2007. This text was included in a short reader developed by the Lewada Bible Translation Center to showcase a new spelling system for the Ende language. In 2015, \WKS{} and \KLL{} adapted the text to an updated spelling system and translated it into \ili{English} (\cite{Bewag2007}). After it was written down, \MSKfull{} read the text aloud for the Ende language corpus (\cite{Sowatikurupel2017a}).
