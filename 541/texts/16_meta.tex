\textit{Gämällang komlla} `A tale of two thieves' or `Lobster and Frog' is a parable originally written by \RWWfull{} in 2016 for the children's storybook, \textit{Pepeb peba} compiled by the Ende Language Committee \citep{Johnson2016a}. The story garnered so much laughter that we asked \RWW{} to retell the story with an audience present \citep{Warama2016j}. That version was transcribed, translated, and edited by \WKS{}, \TTW{}, and \KLL{} to become \citet{Warama2016c}, the written version presented here. Both \RWW{} and her brother \TTW{} read the final written version out loud \citep{Warama2016t,Warama2016d}. \SSSfull{} illustrated the original publication and her drawings are included here as well.
