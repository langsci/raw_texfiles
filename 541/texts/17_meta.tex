The following text titled \textit{Eramang Karama walle} `Ode to Karama Swamp' is an ode written by \WKSfull{}. It was written prior to 2007, when it appeared in a short reader developed in partnership with the Lewada Bible Translation Center to illustrate the newly developed Ende spelling system. It was edited by \WKS{} and \KLL{} in 2015 to the updated spelling system and submitted to the Ende language corpus with an accompanying translation (\cite{Kurupelsuwede2007}). In 2017, \WKS{} read the written text out loud (\cite{Kurupelsuwede2017f}).
