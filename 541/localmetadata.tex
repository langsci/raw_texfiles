\BackBody{This collection of Ende stories and songs contains 20 texts from the Ende language corpus, a repository of Ende language and culture. The texts were compiled by the Ende Language Committee and represent a diverse set of authors, illustrators, and translators from the community. Each text is accompanied by a summary, contextual background, and presented in two formats: a running text format in parallel with an English translation, and an interlinearized format with English translations at the morpheme and sentence levels. The texts cover a broad slice of Ende life and are organized into five thematic parts: Animal Tales and Origin Stories, Tales of Hunting and Survival, Heroic or Legendary Stories, Tales of Misbehavior and Consequence, and Odes and Reflections on the Natural World. Audio versions of all the texts are available online through the Ende language corpus.
