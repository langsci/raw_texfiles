\addchap{Preface}

This book has had a rather long gestation period. The papers in this collective volume originate in
a selection of the papers that were presented at a workshop at Freie Universität Berlin in May
2017, which was jointly organised by Ulrike Freywald, then University of Potsdam, and Horst Simon,
FU Berlin. In an elaborate and anonymous peer review process, the papers were selected and revised
under the guidance of UF and HS, and finally refined and brought into their present shape by Stefan
Müller, who had also presented at the workshop, and his team at HU Berlin. 

We thank various institutions and individuals, above all the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the
Ernst-Reuter-Gesellschaft der Freunde, Förderer und Ehemaligen der Freien Universität Berlin
e.V. for their financial support of the workshop, then a host of colleagues, who need to remain
anonymous, who have offered their expertise when peer reviewing, and finally a group of student
assistants in the final process of polishing the papers into publishable form, namely Elisabeth
Eberle, Luisa Kalvelage, and Julie Täge.

It is to be hoped that the present volume will testify more to the potential headlessness of the
structures discussed than to the headlessness of the pondering linguist.
