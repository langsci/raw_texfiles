Apart from the people acknowledged in each of the published studies, this book has been shaped throughout the years by a number of people in particular, who I would like to thank here.

Martine Grice; thank you for guiding me in the habilitation process and providing me with constructive feedback in the recent years. Over a much longer period of time, basically since the start of my studies, the work coming from the Phonetics Institute in Cologne has inspired me deeply. I am particularly grateful to you for this.

Nikolaus Himmelmann; thank you for the supervision of my work over the last years. It has shaped my research in many ways and was invaluable for the outline of the thesis. Thank you also for fuelling my interest in doing typological work. Your input has sharpened my thinking and helped me to keep a critical view on my own work.

Angela Kluge; thank you for the important work you did on Papuan Malay before I started working on it. It has provided an ideal basis to work with. Thank you also for the collaboration and help, in particular with Chapter \ref{chLex}.

Vincent van Heuven; thank you for the critical comments on several draft versions of the studies outlined here as well as on an earlier version of this book. You inspired me for over two decades now and it is a privilege to benefit from your understanding and experience. It made me realise that there is so much more to understand and to do.

Rob Goedemans; thank you for the lively discussions on the phonetics and phonology of word stress in Indonesian and beyond. They have reassured me that the two fields are too deeply intertwined to ignore one or the other. Thank you also for your valuable and encouraging input on several studies presented in this book. You remained patient and understanding when I went nuts on acoustic evidence.

Anne Cutler; although we were in touch only briefly, she provided me with very clear and constructive feedback. I am thankful for that, but even more so for the truly inspiring research she left behind. It has definitely set the direction of the experimental approaches in this book, as well as my thinking about language production and perception. Because unfortunately I cannot thank her in person any more, I believe mentioning her here is the least I can do.

Maximilian Hörl; thanks, Max, for your very helpful statistical advice. You always returned my questions with constructive feedback and many times presented solutions in a ready-to-use fashion. Often, you managed to understand where I wanted to go before I did. I am also thankful for our friendship and the nice times we have spent together.

Maria Bardají; thank you, Maria, for all the moments we shared in the office, and the great times we had after work. You are the ideal colleague; smiling, always in a good mood and at any moment ready to help, to listen or in for a joke. I value our friendship and miss our office life.
