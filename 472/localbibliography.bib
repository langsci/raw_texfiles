	abstract = {This book provides the first systematic descriptive analysis of the phonological system of Romanian, one of the less studied Romance languages, from the perspective of recent phonological theory. The author offers an account of some of the major phonological processes of modern standard Romanian, set in the framework of Optimality Theory and Correspondence Theory. The book begins with an overview of Romanian phonology - segment inventory, phonotactics, inflectional and derivational morphology. The main part of the study focuses on processes involving vocalic segments: glide-vowel and diphthong-vowel alternations, vowel harmony, palatalization. The major issues addressed include feature theory, syllable structure, metrical structure and stress, the interaction between phonology and morphology. Acoustic phonetic data is used as supporting evidence for the phonological patterning of diphthongs and glide-vowel sequences. Interesting complexities of the system are pointed out and discussed, as they pose certain challenges to the theoretical model. The book contains an abundance of systematically organized data, which makes it a solid reference for students and scholars of general and Romance phonology, and a strong basis for further study},

The outcomes have contributed to the conclusion that these languages do not have word stress. The current study revisits this conclusion and investigates to what extent speakers of Papuan Malay, a language of Eastern Indonesia, use suprasegmental stress cues to recognize words. Acoustically, this language exhibits predictable word level prominence patterns, which could facilitate word recognition. However, the literature lacks a crucial perceptual verification and related languages in the Trade Malay family have been analysed as stressless. This could be indicative of either regional variation or different criteria to diagnose word stress. To investigate this issue, the current study reviews the literature on which criteria were decisive to diagnose (the absence of) word stress in Indonesian and Trade Malay. An acoustic analysis and a gating task investigate the usefulness of Papuan Malay stress cues for word recognition. Results show that Papuan Malay listeners are indeed able to use suprasegmental stress cues to identify words. The outcomes are discussed in a typological perspective to shed light on how production and perception studies contribute to stress diagnosis cross-linguistically.},

Although boundary marking has been uncontroversially shown as the major prosodic function in these languages, studies on the use of pitch accents to highlight important words in a phrase remain inconclusive. In addition, most knowledge of pitch accents is based on well-researched languages such as the ones from the Western-Germanic language family. This paper reports two word identification experiments comparing Papuan Malay with the pitch accent language American English, in order to investigate the~extent to which the demarcating and highlighting function of prosody can be disentangled. To this end, target words were presented to native listeners of both languages and differed with respect to their position in the phrase (medial or final) and the shape of their f0 movement (original or manipulated). Reaction times for the target word identifications revealed overall faster responses for original and final words compared to manipulated and medial ones. The results add to previous findings on the facilitating effect of pitch accents and further improve our prosodic knowledge of underresearched languages.},

	abstract = {The existence of word stress in Indonesian languages has been controversial. Recent acoustic analyses of Papuan Malay suggest that this language has word stress, counter to other studies and unlike closely related languages. The current study further investigates Papuan Malay by means of lexical (non-acoustic) analyses of two different aspects of word stress. In particular, this paper reports two distribution analyses of a word corpus, 1) investigating the extent to which stress patterns may help word recognition and 2) exploring the phonological factors that predict the distribution of stress patterns. The facilitating role of stress patterns in word recognition was investigated in a lexical analysis of word embeddings. The results show that Papuan Malay word stress (potentially) helps to disambiguate words. As for stress predictors, a random forest analysis investigated the effect of multiple morpho-phonological factors on stress placement. It was found that the mid vowels /?/ and /?/ play a central role in stress placement, refining the conclusions of previous work that mainly focused on /?/. The current study confirms that non-acoustic research on stress can complement acoustic research in important ways. Crucially, the combined findings on stress in Papuan Malay so far give rise to an integrated perspective to word stress, in which phonetic, phonological and cognitive factors are considered.},

	title = {Na\"ive listeners' prominence and boundary perception},
	abstract = {This paper examines how ordinary listeners, na{\"i}ve with respect to the phonetics and phonology of prosody, perceive the location of prosodic boundaries that demarcate speech "chunks" and prominences that serve a "highlighting" function, in spontaneous speech (Buckeye corpus). Over 70 na{\"i}ve listeners marked the locations of prominences and boundaries in a real-time transcription task. Fleiss' multi-transcribers' reliability tests show that na{\"i}ve transcribers are consistent in their perception of prosodic boundaries and prominences. Specifically, we observe higher multi-transcriber agreement scores for boundary marking than for prominence marking. Variation between transcriptions of the same speech excerpt produced by different listeners reveals individual differences in the perception of prominences and boundaries. Variation in Fleiss' multi-transcribers' agreement scores for excerpts from different speakers suggests that speakers vary in how they structure an utterance prosodically and/or in how effectively they cue prosodic structure. We also find that nuclear prominences are more consistently perceived by na{\"i}ve listeners than prenuclear prominences. The finding that na{\"i}ve listeners agree well above chance on the location of prosodic events indicates that na{\"i}ve transcription is a valid method for prosody analysis which can augment analysis based solely on expert labeling.},

It brings together in a single volume a detailed explication of the stylization method used in the analysis of intonation; theoretical insights and the experimental evidence that supports them, the results of physiological measurements that substantiate hypotheses about the production of intonation; and applications arising from the research. Johan't Hart, Rene Collier and Antonie Cohen argue that a perception-oriented approach, carried out by studying the perceptual consequences of deliberate manipulations of the speech signal, is the only way in which it can be decided what, out of the abundant information in the acoustic domain, is important for the listener and hence may be relevant for communication. The method they employ is fruitful not only for the analysis of Dutch, but also of British English, German and Russian intonation.},

	abstract = {Reaction times (RTs) are an important source of information in experimental psychology. Classical methodological considerations pertaining to the statistical analysis of RT data are optimized for analyses of aggregated data, based on subject or item means (c.f., Forster \& Dickinson, 1976). Mixed-effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, \& Bates, 2008) does not require prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical exibility with respect to the choice of transformation for the RTs. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal dependencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of interactions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

	abstract = {Spanish but not French uses accent to distinguish between words (e.g., t{\'o}po vs top{\'o}). Two populations of subjects were tested on the same materials to determine whether this difference has an impact on the perceptual capacities of listeners. In Experiment 1, using an ABX paradigm, we found that French subjects had significantly more difficulties than Spanish subjects in performing an ABX classification task based on accent. In Experiment 2, we found that Spanish subjects were unable to ignore irrelevant differences in accent in a phoneme-based ABX task, whereas French subjects had no difficulty at all. In Experiment 3, we replicated the basic French finding and found that Spanish subjects benefited from redundant accent information even when phonemic information alone was sufficient to perform the task. In our final experiment, we showed that French subjects can be made to respond to the acoustic correlates of accent; therefore their difficulty in Experiment 1 seems to be located at the level of short-term memory. The implications of these findings for language-specific processing and acquisition are discussed.},

Cura{\c c}ao Papiamentu has both lexically distinctive stress and, independently, a word-level tone contrast. On the basis of a detailed acoustic investigation of this tonal contrast, we propose a privative phonological interpretation of the tone contrast, similar to proposals for the Scandinavian word-accent systems (Riad 1998, to appear). As compared to previous treatments of Cura{\c c}ao Papiamentu word prosody, our hypothesis makes crucial reference to intonation and to tonal underspecification. We also investigate the realisation of primary and secondary stress in Cura{\c c}ao Papiamentu.},

	abstract = {Research on the exploitation of prosodic information in the comprehension of spoken language is reviewed. The research falls into three main areas: the use of prosody in the recognition of spoken words, in which most attention has been paid to the question of whether the prosodic structure of a word plays a role in initial activation of stored lexical representations; the use of prosody in the computation of syntactic structure, in which the resolution of global and local ambiguities has formed the central focus; and the role of prosody in the processing of discourse structure, in which there has been a preponderance of work on the contribution of accentuation and deaccentuation to integration of concepts with an existing discourse model. The review reveals that in each area progress has been made towards new conceptions of prosody's role in processing, and in particular this has involved abandonment of previously held deterministic views of the relationship between prosodic structure and other aspects of linguistic structure.},

Two functions of Papuan Malay phrase prosody are analysed here, namely the marking of phrase boundaries (demarcating) and the marking of important elements within the phrase (highlighting). The limited work on Papuan Malay suggests that its prosody mainly serves a demarcating function. This hypothesis is tested by means of an acoustic analysis of F0 in phrase-final syllables. Results confirm previous work on demarcation but provide new insights into the role of highlighting in this language, suggesting a relevant difference as to syllable position: While final syllables mark boundaries, F0 movements on prefinal syllables seem to serve a highlighting function.},

	abstract = {What is the explanation for vigorous variation between was and were in plural existential constructions, and what is the optimal tool for analyzing it? Previous studies of this phenomenon have used the variable rule program, a generalized linear model; however, recent developments in statistics have introduced new tools, including mixed-effects models, random forests, and conditional inference trees that may open additional possibilities for data exploration, analysis, and interpretation. In a step-by-step demonstration, we show how this well-known variable benefits from these complementary techniques. Mixed-effects models provide a principled way of assessing the importance of random-effect factors such as the individuals in the sample. Random forests provide information about the importance of predictors, whether factorial or continuous, and do so also for unbalanced designs with high multicollinearity, cases for which the family of linear models is less appropriate. Conditional inference trees straightforwardly visualize how multiple predictors operate in tandem. Taken together, the results confirm that polarity, distance from verb to plural element, and the nature of the DP are significant predictors. Ongoing linguistic change and social reallocation via morphologization are operational. Furthermore, the results make predictions that can be tested in future research. We conclude that variationist research can be substantially enriched by an expanded tool kit.},

	abstract = {Varieties of Malay, including Indonesian, have been variously described as having word stress on the penultimate syllable, as having variable word stress and as having a phrase-final pitch accent without word stress. In Ambonese Malay, the alignment of sentence-final pitch peaks fails to support the existence of either word stress or phrase-final pitch accents. Also, the shape of its pitch peaks fails to vary systematically with the information status of the phrase-final word. The two intonation melodies of the language include phrase-final boundary-tone complexes which do not associate with any syllables. The declarative rise-fall would appear to be timed so as to occur within the last word of the sentence. Minimal stress pairs presented in earlier descriptions show a contrast between /a/ and a segmentally distinct weak /{\u a}/, a contrast that also appears in positions that have not been claimed to have stress. A preliminary phonological analysis concludes the account.},

	abstract = {Four cross-modal priming experiments and two forced-choice identification experiments investigated the use of suprasegmental cues to stress in the recognition of spoken English words, by native (English-speaking) and nonnative (Dutch) listeners. Previous results had indicated that suprasegmental information was exploited in lexical access by Dutch but not by English listeners. For both listener groups, recognition of visually presented target words was faster, in comparison to a control condition, after stress-matching spoken primes, either monosyllabic ( mus-from MUsic/muSEum) or bisyllabic ( admi-from ADmiral/admiRAtion ). For native listeners, the effect of stress-mismatching bisyllabic primes was not different from that of control primes, but mismatching monosyllabic primes produced partial facilitation. For non-native listeners, both bisyllabic and monosyllabic stress-mismatching primes produced partial facilitation. Native English listeners thus can exploit suprasegmental information in spoken-word recognition, but information from two syllables is used more effectively than information from one syllable. Dutch listeners are less proficient at using suprasegmental information in English than in their native language, but, as in their native language, use mono- and bisyllabic information to an equal extent. In forced-choice identification, Dutch listeners outperformed native listeners at correctly assigning a monosyllabic fragment (e.g., mus-) to one of two words differing in stress.},

	abstract = {This book presents an in-depth linguistic description of Papuan Malay, a non-standard variety of Malay. The language is spoken in coastal West Papua which covers the western part of the island of New Guinea. The study is based on sixteen hours of recordings of spontaneous narratives and conversations between Papuan Malay speakers, recorded in the Sarmi area on the northeast coast of West Papua. Papuan Malay is the language of wider communication and the first or second language for an ever-increasing number of people of the area. While Papuan Malay is not officially recognized and therefore not used in formal government or educational settings or for religious preaching, it is used in all other domains, including unofficial use in formal settings, and, to some extent, in the public media. After a general introduction to the language, its setting, and history, this grammar discusses the following topics, building up from smaller grammatical constituents to larger ones: phonology, word formation, noun and prepositional phrases, verbal and nonverbal clauses, non-declarative clauses, and conjunctions and constituent combining. Of special interest to linguists, typologists, and Malay specialists are the following in-depth analyses and descriptions: affixation and its productivity across domains of language choice, reduplication and its gesamtbedeutung, personal pronouns and their adnominal uses, demonstratives and locatives and their extended uses, and adnominal possessive relations and their non- canonical uses. This study provides a starting point for Papuan Malay language development efforts and a point of comparison for further studies on other Malay varieties.},

"Nespor \& Vogel 1986" is a citation classic, and even after twenty years, it is still recognized as the standard resource on Prosodic Phonology. This groundbreaking work introduces all of the prosodic domains (syllable, foot, word, clitic group, phonological phrase, intonational phrase and utterance) and comments on the evidence in their favor from numerous languages. It also contains a chapter on the phonology of poetic meter, and a chapter on the experimental testing of the role of the prosodic constituents in the perception of ambiguous sentences. The book is an important reference not only for all phonologists, but for all linguists interested in the problem of interfaces. It is a basic resource also for psycholinguists and for cognitive scientists working on perception of language and language acquisition.},

For illustration purposes, the contours which are reported to occur most commonly are given in schematic form, along with their GToBI transcription and examples of their usage.},

A language with more phonemes will allow shorter words and reduced embedding of short words within longer ones, decreasing the potential for spurious lexical competitors to be activated by speech signals. We demonstrate that this is the case via comparative analyses of the vocabularies of English and Spanish. A language which uses suprasegmental as well as segmental contrasts, however, can substantially reduce the extent of spurious embedding.},

Topics covered include prosodic constituency, degree of disjuncture between adjacent words, boundary tones associated with various utterance types, and nuclear pitch accent placement. Some of the principal findings are as follows. Chickasaw utterances may be broken down into successively smaller constituents, defined in terms of tonal, durational, and accentual properties. Statements end in a rise in fundamental frequency, phonologically a H\% boundary tone; whereas both yes/no and wh-questions end in a fall in fundamental frequency, reflecting a L\% boundary tones. Each Intonational Phrase has a nuclear pitch accent that falls on the last syllable in statements, but typically falls on a syllable to the left of the final one in questions. In addition, phonologically predictable nuclear pitch accents are suppressed when adjacent to the morpholexical pitch accent found in certain words.},
