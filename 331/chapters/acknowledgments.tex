\addchap{\lsAcknowledgementTitle} 

The quality of this book has benefited tremendously from the comments and feedback I have received from several individuals who I would like to acknowledge here. Parts of this book were presented at a colloquium for the Department of Germanic Studies at Indiana University (2018) and at the Conference on Germanic Linguistics (GLAC) at Purdue University (2014) and The Pennsylvania State University (2018). I would like to thank the many members of the audience at those venues who provided me with helpful feedback. In addition, I would like to extend my gratitude to Joe Salmons and an anonymous referee for extremely valuable comments on an earlier version of this book. I would like to thank JÃ¼rg Fleischer for several very illuminating conversations on German dialects and dialectology and Stuart Davis for his insights on various topics in theoretical phonology. I am also indebted to Tyler Kniess for his careful proofreading as well as Matt Johnson of Johnson Cartographic LLC for the excellent work he did in creating the maps. Finally, I am grateful for the support I have received from everyone at Language Science Press for their assistance in the final stages of this book, in particular Sebastian Nordhoff, Felix Kopecky, and the many proofreaders.\bigskip\\
