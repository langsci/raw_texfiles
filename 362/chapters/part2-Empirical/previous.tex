\label{ch:previous-exp}

In this chapter, I attempt to give an overview of the previous work on subject islands, reporting the results that I judged most interesting. I only mention experiments published in peer-reviewed publications or in Ph.D.\ theses and leave aside unpublished conference talks and posters. Nevertheless, given the growing interest of experimental linguistics in islands, the following is likely to be incomplete.

The experiments on French presented in this book, some of which have been published, are not included in this chapter, nor are a few experiments on English that we carried out in parallel with the French ones \citep{Abeille.2019.Quasy,Abeille.2020.Cognition}. They will be taken up later in the book.

I deliberately leave aside the work done by several scholars on a phenomenon called ``satiation'' or ``habituation''. \citet{Sprouse.2007.PhD,Sprouse.2007.Acceptability,Sprouse.2009}, \citet{Francom.2011}, \citet{Goodall.2011}, \citet{Chaves.2014,Chaves.2019.Frequency} and \citet{Chaves.2020.UDC} investigated whether the acceptability of subject islands increases after repeated exposure. All these experiments examined extraction out of subjects in \textit{wh}-questions. The subjects are NP subjects as well as non-finite and finite sentential subjects. The results are mixed, but the latest evidence suggests that the acceptability of extraction out of subjects improves after at least eight exposures.

I also omit studies on non-native speakers because the research questions they target are very different from my own. \citet{Kush.2022} provide a current overview of the state of the art.

I start with studies on extractions out of NP subjects, which are the most common ones, before presenting studies on extractions out of sentential subjects.

\section{Interrogatives}
\label{ch:previous-wh}

Unsurprisingly, the most studied language in these studies is English. Maybe more surprisingly, a large majority of the investigations concentrate on extraction in \textit{wh}-questions (mostly direct \textit{wh}-interrogatives, sometimes also indirect ones). An overview of these studies is found in Table~\ref{tab:previous-english-wh}.

Most studies on English \textit{wh}-questions employ acceptability rating tasks with slightly different methodologies, whose results tend to be roughly similar \citep{Fukuda.2012}. The ``subject island effects'' are attested and seem robust \citep{Sprouse.2007.PhD,Jurka.2010,Sprouse.2012,Fukuda.2012,Sprouse.2016}. All the studies which extracted a PP-complement out of the subject used preposition stranding, except \citet[Experiment 8]{Jurka.2010} and \citet{Bianchi.2015} which test cases both with and without preposition stranding: preposition stranding seems to lower the acceptability of the extraction out of the subject. Some studies compared different verb types \citep{Jurka.2010,Polinsky.2013,Bianchi.2015}, and their results indeed reveal some differences between verbs. But the studies do not systematically measure whether island effects disappear based on those factors. The presence of a quantifier might ameliorate extraction out of the subject, but the effect sizes are very small, thus the results are difficult to interpret \citep[Experiment 11]{Jurka.2010}. Supporting context does not seem to improve extraction out of subjects \citep{Sprouse.2007.PhD} but relevance does \citet{Chaves.2020.UDC}. The results on working memory are mixed: working memory may have an impact on the acceptability ratings of extractions out of subjects, but it does not explain them \citep{Sprouse.2012}. Two online studies measures investigated  whether or not readers postulate a gap in the subject \citep{Phillips.2006,Chaves.2019.Frequency}. Their results go in the same direction, though the authors draw opposite conclusions from them.

Table~\ref{tab:previous-languages-wh} presents studies on \textit{wh}-questions carried out in other languages (only examining direct interrogatives).

Some studies employed a design that makes it possible to detect  island effects (\citealt[Experiment 13b]{Jurka.2010}, \citealt{Jurka.2011,Sprouse.2016} \citealt[Experiment 2]{Greco.2017}, \citealt{Kush.2018,Paneda.2020,Kobzeva.2022}). In those studies, there is almost systematically a significant interaction effect pointing to a potential ``subject island'' (unfortunately, even though \citet[Experiment 1 \& 2]{Jurka.2010} and \citet{Polinsky.2013} used such a design, they do not report the results for the interaction). However, all except one \citep{Greco.2017} use extraction of the whole subject as a baseline to test subextraction. This is not ideal, given that extraction of the subject displays processing advantages. One study that stands out is \citet[Experiment 13a]{Jurka.2010} on Serbian, which does not show a superadditive effect. Some experiments explore different verb types \citep{Jurka.2010,Polinsky.2013,Bianchi.2014} and their results differ from the English ones: in German, Russian and Italian, different verb types seem to behave similarly as far as extraction out of the subject is concerned. The position of the subject affects the acceptability of the subject island condition \citep{Jurka.2010,Jurka.2011,Polinsky.2013,Bianchi.2014}. However, the findings could be due to general preferences that have nothing to do with subextraction, since this is not controlled for with a baseline (or it is not reported).

Several experiments test extraction of the specifier  in languages that allow such extraction \citep{Jurka.2010,Jurka.2011,Polinsky.2013}. The possibility of specifiers behaving differently than complements in subextraction is only explored in \citet[Experiment 13a\&b]{Jurka.2010}. Indeed, \citet[Experiment 13a]{Jurka.2010} does not find superadditive effects when the specifier is extracted, while \citet[Experiment 13b]{Jurka.2010} observes superadditive effects in the extraction of the complement. Notice, however, that the two experiments used different baselines, namely ``no extraction'' (Experiment 13a) and ``extraction of the NP'' (Experiment 13b). Unfortunately there is no test reported for a three-way interaction.

\citeauthor{Sprouse.2007.PhD} and colleagues also conducted a series of experiments on in-situ questions. An overview is provided in Table~\ref{tab:previous-in-situ}.

Since in-situ questions in English are uncommon and restricted to specific contexts, \citet{Sprouse.2007.PhD} and \citet{Sprouse.2011} tested them by using double interrogatives. In these constructions, when a first \textit{wh}-phrase is extracted, a second \textit{wh}-phrase can be in situ. The results are mixed: depending on the baseline, a superadditive effect may be observed. In Japanese, interrogatives are in situ by default, so \citet{Sprouse.2011} was able to test  the \textit{wh}-phrase directly inside the subject. They found no interaction effects, which goes against an analysis of in-situ questions as covert movement. I will develop the issue of in-situ questions in more detail in Section~\ref{ch:exp11}.

\section{Other constructions}

Few studies have tested non-interrogative constructions. Table~\ref{tab:previous-other-cx} presents five such studies.

The distinction between focalizing and non-focalizing extractions is very important for the Focus-Background Conflict constraint (see Section~\ref{ch:discourse}). In the literature, apart from \textit{wh}-questions, the other constructions tested are topicalization \citep{Kush.2019} and relative clauses \citep{Sprouse.2016,Kobzeva.2022}, both of them probably non-focalizing constructions. There is a caveat with \citegen{Kobzeva.2022} study, which examine Norwegian: as the authors note, the Norwegian demonstrative relative clause could be read as a cleft. It is thus difficult to know whether the construction tested by \citeauthor{Kobzeva.2022} is a focalizing construction or not. 

All the studies observe superadditive effects, except the Italian experiment \citep{Sprouse.2016}. As previously discussed, the baseline in these studies might cause a problem (if there is a subject advantage in the baseline, as in extraction of the subject in relative clauses, the interaction might be caused by this subject preference rather than by the subextraction). The Italian experiment in \citep{Sprouse.2016} is also the only one without preposition stranding. 

Only \citet{Kobzeva.2022} looked for a three-way interaction to compare different constructions: they found that the superadditive effect in relative clauses (or clefts) is smaller than in \textit{wh}-questions.

\section{Sentential subjects}

Even though the subject island constraint was first formulated as the sentential subject island constraint \citep{Ross.1967}, there are relatively few studies on extraction out of sentential subjects. These studies are presented in Table~\ref{tab:previous-sentential-subject}.

The studies examined finite and non-finite sentential subjects, sometimes in the same experiment. In English, extractions out of sentential subjects are one of the worse island violation (in raw ratings), and worse for non-finite subjects than finite ones \citep{Sprouse.2007.PhD}. In German, \citet{Jurka.2010} found superadditive effects, but again the baseline condition showed an advantage for the subject condition (meaning that the baseline increases the interaction). Extraposition does not seem to play a role. Finally, it appears that Japanese does not have a ``subject island effect'' \citep{Jurka.2010,Jurka.2011,Fukuda.2014}, in line with what was reported in the literature.
