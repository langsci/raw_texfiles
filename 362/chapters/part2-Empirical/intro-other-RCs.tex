In this chapter, I present two corpus studies.

\begin{description}

\item[Corpus studies on \emph{duquel}:] Data from Frantext show that \emph{duquel} is mostly used in relative clauses. Since it primarily occurs in pied-piping structures, there are only few cases of extraction out of NPs. Still, extraction out of subjects is attested.

\item[Corpus studies on \emph{avec} + \textit{wh}-:] In both relative clauses and interrogatives, \textit{avec} + \textit{wh}- is mostly used as a complement of the verb or as an adjunct. Extraction out of NPs is rare in relative clauses and not attested for interrogatives. Even though we found more extractions out of objects than extractions out of subjects in relative clauses, the numbers are too low to conclude that this difference is a robust one.
