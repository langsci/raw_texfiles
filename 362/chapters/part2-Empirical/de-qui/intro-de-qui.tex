\section{Corpus studies on \emph{de qui}}
\label{ch:de-qui-corpus}
This section summarizes the results of two corpus studies previously published in \citet{Abeille.2020.JFLS} that looked at the distribution of occurrences of \emph{de qui} in Frantext for texts written between 1900 and 1913, and texts written between 2000 and 2013. Unlike \emph{dont}, \emph{de qui} can be used not only in relative clauses but also in interrogatives.
