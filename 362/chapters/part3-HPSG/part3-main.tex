\chapter{Conclusion}

In this last part, I discussed in more detail the FBC constraint and its implications, and proposed a formal analysis in HPSG. In the process, I sketched a substantial fragment of a French grammar in HPSG. I showed a cross-classification of interrogatives \citep[inspired by][]{Ginzburg.2000} and of relative clauses \citep[based on][]{Abeille.2007.Relatives}, while \emph{c'est}-clefts are formed by specific lexical entries of \emph{être} (`be') \citep{Winckel.2020}. I explained how information structure interacts with syntax in these short- and long-distance dependencies. The impression of a ``subject island'' in focalizing constructions arises from the fact that subjects are preferred topics for the majority of verbs. I modeled this preference by treating subjects of such verbs as the \textsc{designated topic}, following a proposal by \citet{Bildhauer.2010}. This allowed me to then propose a formalization of the FBC constraint (\ref{avm:rule-FBC}).
% This bears some resemblance with Webelhuth \citet{Webelhuth.2007}'s Preference Principle: A topic should not contain any focused element.
% Ressemblance with Bresnan & McHomb too

When reflecting on all this evidence showing the non-existence of subject islands, one cannot help but ask why so many linguists have postulated a subject island constraint. I suppose it is possible to see this as a consequence of the fact that most of the examples on which the discussion was based were interrogatives, as were most of the previous experiments.

One major element is missing in my HPSG analysis. In Section~\ref{ch:general-analysis-gradability}, I emphasized that the FBC constraint presupposes gradient information structure. Besides \citegen{Webelhuth.2007} ``more thematic than'' function (which, I think, is not compatible with \citegen{Song.2017} representation of information structure), there has been no attempt in HPSG to capture this gradience. As the goal of the present work was not to determine how and why an element is more or less focus, topic or backgrounded, it can therefore not contribute much to constructing such a model. However, presumably several factors contribute to making an element more or less focused, topicalized or backgrounded. For example, the topic of an embedded clause may be less topical than the topic of the embedding clause. It would then follow that the FBC constraint applies less strongly to elements that are less backgrounded, and this could explain why we do not see superadditive effects in the interrogatives with long-distance dependencies. For the time being, this is unfortunately only speculation. Once the factors have been identified, it should be possible to treat them as weighted constraints and attempt to model the gradience of information structure. Some proposals have been made to introduce weighted constraints in HPSG (in the \emph{Verbmobil} project \citep{Mueller.S.2000}, in \citet{Brew.1995}, in \citet{Guzman.2015}, or in \citet{An.2020}, see \citet[164]{Mueller.S.2017}), but their aim was to compute probabilistic models of sentence processing (production and comprehension)~-- for example the probability of using one or the other dative construction for ditransitive verbs in English (\emph{give Sandra the book / give the book to Sandra}). Any effort to adapt these methods and propose a new way to treat information structure as a gradient feature instead of a categorical feature on lexical signs would contribute greatly to the scientific debate. However, such an attempt goes far beyond the scope of this work.
