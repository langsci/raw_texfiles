\label{ch:discourse}

It is time to address the last type of approach, the one that takes into account pragmatics and discourse. In this chapter I introduce the working hypothesis formulated with colleagues during the years of research that led to the writing of this book: the Focus-Background Conflict constraint. Thus this chapter focuses on aspects of information structure.

It seems indisputable to me that this factor is highly pertinent. I refer the reader to \citet{Chaves.2020.UDC} for a more exhaustive discussion. My own work, however, has addressed a discourse factor that is different from relevance, but which is not in contradiction with it. Before going into more detail about my working hypothesis, I need to define the concepts of information structure that I use in this book (Section \ref{ch:is}), and then present previous works that have explored these notions in the context of islands.
