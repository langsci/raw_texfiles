\addchap{Dedication}

This book is dedicated to the Kagayanen people who received me into their communities, into their homes and into their lives. They so patiently taught me their language and their cultural ways. I am very grateful for all my years learning from them and especially their friendships. Most of all I dedicate this book to \emph{Maal ta na Dios} ‘our Beloved God.’ --- Carol Jean Pebley
