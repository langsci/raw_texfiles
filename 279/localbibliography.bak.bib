	abstract = {Since the beginnings of speech research, the issue of variability has been a central topic in the field. Until recently, solutions to this problem have focused mainly on resolving linguistic forms from variable acoustic realizations, with little systematic consideration of talker variability or social settings. However, acoustic-phonetic variability within and between talkers does not arise by chance – such variation is attributable to a variety of causes including talker physiology, dialect, affect, and social/situational factors. Studies of conversational interaction demonstrate the influence of situational factors on many aspects of spoken communication. In particular, interacting talkers converge and diverge in acoustic-phonetic form over the course of a single conversational setting. Although phonetic convergence likely reflects a close connection between speech perception and production, it is not an automatic consequence of priming mechanisms or a mirror neuron system. In studies of the neural activity associated with speech perception, it is increasingly clear that utterances are processed in separate dorsal and ventral cortical streams, one that is part of the self-regulation of spoken utterances, and another that is part of conceptual understanding. Links between perception and production appear to be part of the self-regulatory system that participates in speech production control monitoring, which makes this system a likely candidate for talker control of acoustic-phonetic variability. Whether talkers converge or diverge depends on multiple aspects of the social setting, which have a much greater influence on the form of phonetic expression than automatic links or mirror mechanisms.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the hypothesis that the more accurately a speaker discriminates a vowelcontrast, the more distinctly the speaker produces that contrast.Measures of speech production and perception were collected from 19 young adult speakers of American English. In the production experiment, speakers repeated the words cod, cud, who’d, and hood in a carrier phrase at normal, clear, and fast rates. Articulatory movements and the associated acoustic signal were recorded, yielding measures of contrast distance between /ɑ/ and /ʌ/ and between /u/ and /ʊ/. In the discrimination experiment, sets of seven natural-sounding stimuli ranging from cod to cud and who’d to hood were synthesized, based on productions by one male and one female speaker. The continua were then presented to each of the 19 speakers in labeling and discrimination tasks. Consistent with the hypothesis, speakers with discrimination scores above the median produced greater acoustic contrasts than speakers with discrimination scores at or below the median. Such a relation between speech production and perception is compatible with a model of speech production in which articulatory movements for vowels are planned primarily in auditory space.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to test whether both phonetic and phonological representations of intonation can be rapidly modified when imitating utterances belonging to a different regional variety of the same language. Our main hypothesis was that tonal alignment, just as other phonetic features of speech, would be rapidly modified by Italian speakers when imitating pitch accents of a different (Southern) variety of Italian. In particular, we tested whether Bari Italian (BI) speakers would produce later peaks for their native rising L + H* (question pitch accent) in the process of imitating Neapolitan Italian (NI) rising L* + H accents. Also, we tested whether BI speakers are able to modify other phonetic properties (pitch level) as well as phonological characteristics (changes in tonal composition) of the same contour. In a follow-up study, we tested if the reverse was also true, i.e., whether NI speakers would produce earlier peaks within the L* + H accent in the process of imitating the L + H* of BI questions, despite the presence of a contrast between two rising accents in this variety. Our results show that phonetic detail of tonal alignment can be successfully modified by both BI and NI speakers when imitating a model speaker of the other variety. The hypothesis of a selective imitation process preventing alignment modifications in NI was hence not supported. Moreover the effect was significantly stronger for low frequency words. Participants were also able to imitate other phonetic cues, in that they modified global utterance pitch level. Concerning phonological convergence, speakers modified the tonal specification of the edge tones in order to resemble that of the other variety by either suppressing or increasing the presence of a final H\%. Hence, our data show that intonation imitation leads to fast modification of both phonetic and phonological intonation representations including detail of tonal alignment and pitch scaling.},

	abstract = {The study of animal communication has led to significant progress in our general understanding of motor and sensory systems, evolution, and speciation. However, one often neglected aspect is that signal exchange in every modality is constrained by noise, be it in the transmission channel or in the nervous system. This book analyses whether and how animals can cope with such constraints, and explores the implications that noise has for our understanding of animal communication. It is written by leading biologists working on different taxa including insects, fish, amphibians, lizards, birds, and mammals. In addition to this broad taxonomic approach, the chapters also cover a wide array of research disciplines: from the mechanisms of signal production and perception, to the behavioural ecology of signalling, the evolution of animal communication, and conservation issues. This volume promotes the integration of the knowledge gained by the diverse approaches to the study of animal communication and, at the same time, highlights particularly interesting fields of current and future research.},

	abstract = {Vocalization is a complex behaviour pattern, consisting of essentially three components: laryngeal activity, respiratory movements and supralaryngeal (articulatory) activity. The motoneurones controlling this behaviour are located in various nuclei in the pons (trigeminal motor nucleus), medulla (facial nucleus, nucl. ambiguus, hypoglossal nucleus) and ventral horn of the spinal cord (cervical, thoracic and lumbar region). Coordination of the different motoneurone pools is carried out by an extensive network comprising the ventrolateral parabrachial area, lateral pontine reticular formation, anterolateral and caudal medullary reticular formation, and the nucl. retroambiguus. This network has a direct access to the phonatory motoneurone pools and receives proprioceptive input from laryngeal, pulmonary and oral mechanoreceptors via the solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei. The motor-coordinating network needs a facilitatory input from the periaqueductal grey of the midbrain and laterally bordering tegmentum in order to be able to produce vocalizations. Voluntary control of vocalization, in contrast to completely innate vocal reactions, such as pain shrieking, needs the intactness of the forebrain. Voluntary control over the initiation and suppression of vocal utterances is carried out by the mediofrontal cortex (including anterior cingulate gyrus and supplementary as well as pre-supplementary motor area). Voluntary control over the acoustic structure of vocalizations is carried out by the motor cortex via pyramidal/corticobulbar as well as extrapyramidal pathways. The most important extrapyramidal pathway seems to be the connection motor cortex–putamen–substantia nigra–parvocellular reticular formation–phonatory motoneurones. The motor cortex depends upon a number of inputs for fulfilling its task. It needs a cerebellar input via the ventrolateral thalamus for allowing a smooth transition between consecutive vocal elements. It needs a proprioceptive input from the phonatory organs via nucl. ventralis posterior medialis thalami, somatosensory cortex and inferior parietal cortex. It needs an input from the ventral premotor and prefrontal cortex, including Broca's area, for motor planning of longer purposeful utterances. And it needs an input from the supplementary and pre-supplementary motor area which give rise to the motor commands executed by the motor cortex.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The Lombard effect describes the tendency for speakers to increase pitch, intensity, and duration in the presence of noise. It is unclear whether these modifications are uniformly applied across all words within an utterance or whether information-bearing content words are further enhanced compared with function words. In the present study, the authors investigated the influence of linguistic content on acoustic modifications made to speech in noise.
METHOD: Sixteen speaker-listener pairs engaged in an interactive cooperative game in quiet, 60 dB of multitalker noise, and 90 dB of multitalker noise. Speaker productions were analyzed to examine differences in fundamental frequency (F(0)), intensity, and duration of target words in sentences across noise conditions.
RESULTS: Proportional increases in F(0,) intensity, and duration were noted for all word types as noise increased from quiet to 60 dB. From quiet to 90 dB, content words that referred to agents, objects, and locations were disproportionately elongated compared with function words. Additionally, agents were further enhanced by increased F(0).
CONCLUSIONS: At moderate noise levels, most word types appear to be uniformly boosted in F(0), intensity, and duration. As noise increases, linguistic content shapes the extent of the Lombard effect, with F(0) and duration serving as primary cues for marking information-bearing word types.},

By comparing the findings from anurans, birds and mammals, we try to trace back the phylogenetic origins of this basic vocal mechanism for acoustic communication in noise. The current evidence suggests two alternative parsimonious hypotheses: either the Lombard effect is the outcome of a convergent evolution in birds and mammals or it may be a synapomorphy of all amniotes. If the latter is true, then the Lombard effect would have evolved to maintain vocal communication in the presence of noise more than 300 million years ago.},

The plausibility of these models is potentially relevant for human evolutionary accounts insofar as humans possess some phenotypic trait that could serve as a reliable tag. Linguistic markers, such as accent and dialect, have frequently been either cursorily defended or promptly dismissed as satisfying the criteria of a reliable and evolutionarily viable tag. This paper integrates evidence from a range of disciplines to develop and assess the claim that speech accent mediated the evolution of tag-based cooperation in humans. Existing evidence warrants the preliminary conclusion that accent markers meet the demands of an evolutionarily viable tag and potentially afforded a cost-effective solution to the challenges of maintaining viable cooperative relationships in diffuse, regional social networks.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical models have demonstrated that phenotypic traits can support the non-random assortment of cooperators in a population, thereby permitting the evolution of cooperation. In these “tag-based models”, cooperators modulate cooperation according to an observable and hard-to-fake trait displayed by potential interaction partners. Socially acquired vocalizations in general, and speech accent among humans in particular, are frequently proposed as hard to fake and hard to hide traits that display sufficient cross-populational variability to reliably guide such social assortment in fission–fusion societies. Adults’ sensitivity to accent variation in social evaluation and decisions about cooperation is well-established in sociolinguistic research. The evolutionary and developmental origins of these biases are largely unknown, however. Here, we investigate the influence of speech accent on 5–10-year-old children's developing social and cooperative preferences across four Brazilian Amazonian towns. Two sites have a single dominant accent, and two sites have multiple co-existing accent varieties. We found that children's friendship and resource allocation preferences were guided by accent only in sites characterized by accent heterogeneity. Results further suggest that this may be due to a more sensitively tuned ear for accent variation. The demonstrated local-accent preference did not hold in the face of personal cost. Results suggest that mechanisms guiding tag-based assortment are likely tuned according to locally relevant tag-variation.},

According to this account, a tendency to favour similar others (homophily) has been a key driving force in creating unique human forms of culture and thus evoked the striking differences we observe between human groups. We begin by presenting evidence that, from the early stages of development, humans have shown a strong tendency to interact with, and learn from, individuals who are similar to themselves. Following this, we propose that the homophilic preferences of the group in general has created a feedback loop that ensures that children engage in high-fidelity copying of the group’s behavioural repertoire. This allows children to reap the benefits of others’ homophilic preferences and to therefore maintain their position within the group. In consequence, homophilic preferences have transformed a number of mechanisms that we share with other species, for example emulation and majority-biased transmission, into human unique variants such as social imitation and conformity. Homophilic preferences have furthermore spawned a new tendency to interpret the structure of actions as social signals: norm-psychology. The homophily account thus connects previously disparate findings in comparative, developmental, and social psychology and provides a unified account of the importance of the preference for similar others in species-specific human social behaviour.},

These errors were hypothesized to originate from self-organizing mechanisms underlying context-free gestural coordination. The current study investigates whether such self-organizing mechanisms and resulting speech errors are influenced by coproduction constraints, which are introduced by phonetic context. Speakers repeated CVC–CVC word pairs, differing in onsets and sharing their rhymes. “Phonetic context” was manipulated by changing the rhyme across different word pairs using specific vowel- and consonant-combinations. Vertical movements of tongue tip, tongue dorsum, and lower lip were recorded with Electro-Magnetic Articulography. The results revealed that the tongue dorsum as an intruding articulator showed more intrusions in front vowel context than in low back vowel context. In addition, this articulator showed more intrusions than the tongue tip in /æ/ context, and more intrusions than the lower lip in /ɪ/ context. Reductions did not demonstrate this effect of vowel context. However, both tongue dorsum and tongue tip reduced more than the lower lip. The findings are explained in terms of the amount of spatial overlap of gestures and intruding articulatory movements, as defined in Articulatory Phonology.},

This confirms earlier proposals in the literature that code-switching in bilingual children decreases when they gain proficiency in their dominant language, especially in vocabulary. Contradicting expectations from other studies, our corpus data also reveal that for adults, multi-word insertions of Nepali into Chintang are just as likely to undergo full syntactic integration as single-word insertions. Speakers of younger generations show less syntactic integration. We propose that this reflects a change between generations, from strongly asymmetrical, Chintang-dominated bilingualism in older generations to more balanced bilingualism where Chintang and Nepali operate as clearly separate systems in younger generations.

	abstract = {Human cooperation is highly unusual. We live in large groups composed mostly of non-relatives. Evolutionists have proposed a number of explanations for this pattern, including cultural group selection and extensions of more general processes such as reciprocity, kin selection, and multi-level selection acting on genes. Evolutionary processes are consilient; they affect several different empirical domains, such as patterns of behavior and the proximal drivers of that behavior. In this target article, we sketch the evidence from five domains that bear on the explanatory adequacy of cultural group selection and competing hypotheses to explain human cooperation. Does cultural transmission constitute an inheritance system that can evolve in a Darwinian fashion? Are the norms that underpin institutions among the cultural traits so transmitted? Do we observe sufficient variation at the level of groups of considerable size for group selection to be a plausible process? Do human groups compete, and do success and failure in competition depend upon cultural variation? Do we observe adaptations for cooperation in humans that most plausibly arose by cultural group selection? If the answer to one of these questions is “no,” then we must look to other hypotheses. We present evidence, including quantitative evidence, that the answer to all of the questions is “yes” and argue that we must take the cultural group selection hypothesis seriously. If culturally transmitted systems of rules (institutions) that limit individual deviance organize cooperation in human societies, then it is not clear that any extant alternative to cultural group selection can be a complete explanation.},

	abstract = {Participants took part in two speech tests. In both tests, a model speaker produced vowel–consonant–vowels (VCVs) in which the initial vowel varied unpredictably in duration. In the simple response task, participants shadowed the initial vowel; when the model shifted to production of any of three CVs (/pa/, /ta/ or /ka/), participants produced a CV that they were assigned to say (one of /pa/, /ta/ or /ka/). In the choice task, participants shadowed the initial vowel; when the model shifted to a CV, participants shadowed that too. We found that, measured from the model’s onset of closure for the consonant to the participant’s closure onset, response times in the choice task exceeded those in the simple task by just 26 ms. This is much shorter than the canonical difference between simple and choice latencies [100–150 ms according to ] and is near the fastest simple times that Luce reports. The findings imply rapid access to articulatory speech information in the choice task. A second experiment found much longer choice times when the perception–production link for speech could not be exploited. A third experiment and an acoustic analysis verified that our measurement from closure in Experiment 1 provided a valid marker of speakers’ onsets of consonant production. A final experiment showed that shadowing responses are imitations of the model’s speech. We interpret the findings as evidence that listeners rapidly extract information about speakers’ articulatory gestures.},

	abstract = {A motor theory of speech perception, initially proposed to account for results of early experiments with synthetic speech, is now extensively revised to accommodate recent findings, and to relate the assumptions of the theory to those that might be made about other perceptual modes. According to the revised theory, phonetic information is perceived in a biologically distinct system, a ‘module’ specialized to detect the intended gestures of the speaker that are the basis for phonetic categories. Built into the structure of this module is the unique but lawful relationship between the gestures and the acoustic patterns in which they are variously overlapped. In consequence, the module causes perception of phonetic structure without translation from preliminary auditory impressions. Thus, it is comparable to such other modules as the one that enables an animal to localize sound. Peculiar to the phonetic module are the relation between perception and production it incorporates and the fact that it must compete with other modules for the same stimulus variations.},

Despite an overall similarity, an acoustic analysis revealed significant differences in the call structure between populations. To test the perceptual salience of these acoustic differences, we conducted playback experiments in both populations in which calls from the own or the other population were broadcast. The overall response pattern did not differ significantly between the populations with regard to the origin of the call. However, subjects responded slightly, but significantly longer after playback of calls from the other group. Although call function apparently determined the general response of subjects, they none the less discriminated between calls from different origins. These results suggest a small but possibly meaningful plasticity in call production.},

Swiss dialects rarely appeared in written form before the 1980s, apart from the genre of dialect literature. Due to the growing acceptance of informal writing styles in many European languages, dialect is increasingly employed for written personal communication, in particular in computer-mediated communication (CMC). In Swiss Internet Relay Chat (IRC) rooms, varieties of German are used side by side as all chatters have a command of both standard and dialectal varieties. Depending on the channel, the proportion of dialectal contributions can be as high as 90 percent. The choice of a particular variety depends on both individual preference and on the predominant variety used within a specific thread. In this paper I take a quantitative approach to language variation in IRC and demonstrate how such an approach can help embed qualitative research on code-switching in CMC.},

This paper analyses how New Zealanders produce these vowels when in an Australian-primed context. Two studies are undertaken. The first – a corpus analysis – looks at the realization of these vowels in New Zealanders' spontaneous talk about Australia. The second – an experiment – looks at the realization of these vowels in a word reading task, following the production of Australia-related lexical items. Both the experiment and the corpus analysis show differences in participant productions across Australia and non-Australia contexts. The corpus analysis shows a significant effect on the realization of the KIT and TRAP vowels, with Australian contexts associated with more Australian realizations. Both the corpus and the experiment reveal a significant interaction between speaker experience and context for DRESS. Only speakers who have ample previous experience with Australian English produce more Australian variants in an Australian context. These results highlight how different methodological approaches can provide different angles on the same question. Together, they show that subtle topic-based variation in speech production can occur. They also indicate that individual speakers' experience and beliefs can also play an important mediating role.},

	abstract = {The study of sound change in progress in Philadelphia has been facilitated by the application of forced alignment and automatic vowel measurement to a large corpus of neighborhood studies, including 379 speakers with dates of birth from 1888 to 1991. Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back upgliding vowels /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features of local phonology, tense /æh/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education. Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadelphia vowel system can be understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in common with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here as subject to phonological generalizations but driven by social evaluation as features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community.*},

Further scrutiny of this result, however, illustrates that linguistic indexicality is not as straightforward as it originally appears. Subsequent analyses of the data highlight the ways in which the perceptual evaluation of sexuality is a highly contingent process, dependent upon a variety of sociolinguistic factors. An envelope of variation in listeners' affective judgments of a speaker is shown to exist, and it is argued that research on the perception of identity must go beyond identification of salient features, and also consider when and why these features are not salient.},

We consider how these mechanisms might be implicated in human–computer interaction (HCI), and then review recent empirical studies that investigated linguistic alignment in HCI. We argue that there is strong evidence that alignment occurs in HCI, but that it differs in important ways from that found in interactions between humans: It is generally stronger and has a larger mediated component that is concerned with enhancing communicative success.},

Pairs of speakers took it in turns to describe pictures to each other. One speaker was a confederate of the experimenter and produced scripted descriptions that systematically varied in syntactic structure. The syntactic structure of the confederate's description affected the syntactic structure of the other speaker's subsequent description. We suggest that these effects are instances of syntactic priming (Bock, 1986), and provide evidence for a shared level of representation in comprehension and production.

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01163},
	abstract = {One way of evaluating the salience of a linguistic feature is by assessing the extent to which listeners associate the feature with a social category such as a particular socioeconomic class, gender, or nationality. Such ‘top–down’ associations will inevitably differ somewhat from listener to listener, as a linguistic feature – the pronunciation of a vowel or consonant, for instance – can evoke multiple social category associations, depending upon the dialect in which the feature is embedded and the context in which it is heard. In a given speech community it is reasonable to expect, as a consequence of the salience of the linguistic form in question, a certain level of intersubjective agreement on social category associations. Two metrics we can use to quantify the salience of a linguistic feature are (a) the speed with which the association is made, and (b) the degree to which members of a speech community appear to share the association. Through the use of a new technique, designed as an adaptation of the Implicit Association Test, this paper examines levels of agreement among 40 informants from the Scottish/English border region with respect to the associations they make between four key phonetic variables and the social categories of ‘Scotland’ and ‘England.’ Our findings reveal that the participants exhibit differential agreement patterns across the set of phonetic variables, and that listeners’ responses vary in line with whether participants are members of the Scottish or the English listener groups. These results demonstrate the importance of community-level agreement with respect to the associations that listeners make between social categories and linguistic forms, and as a means of ranking the forms’ relative salience.},

The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive. As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code comments.

In this review, we use birds and cetaceans to explain what vocal matching is, why animals vocally match and how vocal matching can be identified. We show that while the functional aspects of vocal matching are similar, the contexts in which matching is used can differ between taxa. Whereas vocal matching in songbirds facilitates mate attraction and the immediate defence of resources, in parrots and cetaceans it plays a role in the maintenance of social bonds and the promotion of behavioural synchrony. We propose criteria for defining vocal matching with the aim of stimulating more matching studies across a wider range of taxa, including those using other, non-vocal, communication modalities. Finally, we encourage future studies to explore the importance of vocal learning in the development of vocal matching, and the information it may provide to third parties in the communication network.},

	abstract = {The laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) is essential for the production of learned vocal behaviors because bilateral damage to this area renders humans unable to speak but has no apparent effect on innate vocalizations such as human laughing and crying or monkey calls. Several hypotheses have been put forward attempting to explain the evolutionary changes from monkeys to humans that potentially led to enhanced LMC functionality for finer motor control of speech production. These views, however, remain limited to the position of the larynx area within the motor cortex, as well as its connections with the phonatory brainstem regions responsible for the direct control of laryngeal muscles. Using probabilistic diffusion tractography in healthy humans and rhesus monkeys, we show that, whereas the LMC structural network is largely comparable in both species, the LMC establishes nearly 7-fold stronger connectivity with the somatosensory and inferior parietal cortices in humans than in macaques. These findings suggest that important “hard-wired” components of the human LMC network controlling the laryngeal component of speech motor output evolved from an already existing, similar network in nonhuman primates. However, the evolution of enhanced LMC–parietal connections likely allowed for more complex synchrony of higher-order sensorimotor coordination, proprioceptive and tactile feedback, and modulation of learned voice for speech production.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The role of the primary motor cortex in the formation of a comprehensive network controlling speech and language has been long underestimated and poorly studied. Here, we provide comparative and quantitative evidence for the significance of this region in the control of a highly learned and uniquely human behavior: speech production. From the viewpoint of structural network organization, we discuss potential evolutionary advances of enhanced temporoparietal cortical connections with the laryngeal motor cortex in humans compared with nonhuman primates that may have contributed to the development of finer vocal motor control necessary for speech production.},

	abstract = {Vocal learning is usually studied in songbirds and humans, species that can form auditory templates by listening to acoustic models and then learn to vocalize to match the template. Most other species are thought to develop vocalizations without auditory feedback. However, auditory input influences the acoustic structure of vocalizations in a broad distribution of birds and mammals. Vocalizations are dened here as sounds generated by forcing air past vibrating membranes. A vocal motor program may generate vocalizations such as crying or laughter, but auditory feedback may be required for matching precise acoustic features of vocalizations. This chapter discriminates limited vocal learning, which uses auditory input to fine-tune acoustic features of an inherited auditory template, from complex vocal learning, in which novel sounds are learned by matching a learned auditory template. Two or three songbird taxa and four or ve mammalian taxa are known for complex vocal learning. A broader range of mammals converge in the acoustic structure of vocalizations when in socially interacting groups, which qualifies as limited vocal learning. All birds and mammals tested use auditory-vocal feedback to adjust their vocalizations to compensate for the effects of noise, and many species modulate their signals as the costs and benefits of communicating vary. This chapter asks whether some auditory-vocal feedback may have provided neural substrates for the evolution of vocal learning. Progress will require more precise definitions of different forms of vocal learning, broad comparative review of their presence and absence, and behavioral and neurobiological investigations into the mechanisms underlying the skills.},

We argue that humans’ ability to modulate nonverbal vocal features evolutionarily linked to expression of body size and sex (fundamental and formant frequencies) provides a largely overlooked window into the nature of this intermediate system. Recent behavioral and neural evidence indicates that humans’ vocal control abilities, commonly assumed to subserve speech, extend to these nonverbal dimensions. This capacity appears in continuity with context-dependent frequency modulations recently identified in other mammals, including primates, and may represent a living relic of early vocal control abilities that led to articulated human speech.},

In this study, we examine the relationships among voice pitch, dominance, and male mating success. Males were audio recorded while participating in an unscripted dating-game scenario. Recordings were subsequently manipulated in voice pitch using computer software and then rated by groups of males for dominance. Results indicate that (1) a masculine, low-pitch voice increases ratings of men's physical and social dominance, augmenting the former more than the latter; and (2) men who believe they are physically dominant to their competitor lower their voice pitch when addressing him, whereas men who believe they are less dominant raise it. We also found a nonsignificant trend for men who speak at a lower pitch to report more sexual partners in the past year. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that male intrasexual competition was a salient selection pressure on the voices of ancestral males and contributed to human voice sexual dimorphism.},

	abstract = {AbstractAny account of “what is special about the human brain” (Passingham 2008) must specify the neural basis of our unique ability to produce speech and delineate how these remarkable motor capabilities could have emerged in our hominin ancestors. Clinical data suggest that the basal ganglia provide a platform for the integration of primate-general mechanisms of acoustic communication with the faculty of articulate speech in humans. Furthermore, neurobiological and paleoanthropological data point at a two-stage model of the phylogenetic evolution of this crucial prerequisite of spoken language: (i) monosynaptic refinement of the projections of motor cortex to the brainstem nuclei that steer laryngeal muscles, presumably, as part of a “phylogenetic trend” associated with increasing brain size during hominin evolution; (ii) subsequent vocal-laryngeal elaboration of cortico-basal ganglia circuitries, driven by human-specific FOXP2 mutations.;{\textgreater}This concept implies vocal continuity of spoken language evolution at the motor level, elucidating the deep entrenchment of articulate speech into a “nonverbal matrix” (Ingold 1994), which is not accounted for by gestural-origin theories. Moreover, it provides a solution to the question for the adaptive value of the “first word” (Bickerton 2009) since even the earliest and most simple verbal utterances must have increased the versatility of vocal displays afforded by the preceding elaboration of monosynaptic corticobulbar tracts, giving rise to enhanced social cooperation and prestige. At the ontogenetic level, the proposed model assumes age-dependent interactions between the basal ganglia and their cortical targets, similar to vocal learning in some songbirds. In this view, the emergence of articulate speech builds on the “renaissance” of an ancient organizational principle and, hence, may represent an example of “evolutionary tinkering” (Jacob 1977)., AbstractThe faith that “comparative analysis of the behaviour of modern primates, in conjunction with an accurate phylogenetic tree of relatedness, has the power to chart the early history of human cognitive evolution” (Byrne 2000 p. 543) runs afoul of the fact that no other primate besides humans is capable of vocal production learning. This basic enabling adaptation for articulate speech bears crucially on the reconstruction of language origins., AbstractAckermann et al. mention the “acquisition of species-atypical sounds” in apes without any discussion. In our commentary, we demonstrate that these atypical sounds in chimpanzees not only include laryngeal sounds, but also have a major significance regarding the origins of language, if we consider looking at their context of use, their social properties, their relations with gestures, their lateralization, and their neurofunctional correlates as well., AbstractSpeech prosody is essential for verbal communication. In this commentary I provide an integrative overview, arguing that speech prosody is subserved by the same anatomical and neurochemical mechanisms involved in the processing of reward/affective outcomes., AbstractNeuroimaging studies have verified the important integrative role of the basal ganglia during affective vocalizations. They, however, also point to additional regions supporting vocal monitoring, auditory–motor feedback processing, and online adjustments of vocal motor responses. For the case of affective vocalizations, we suggest partly extending the model to fully consider the link between primate-general and human-specific neural components., AbstractBuilding a theory on extant species, as Ackermann et al. do, is a useful contribution to the field of language evolution. Here, I add another living model that might be of interest: human language ontogeny in the first year of life. A better knowledge of this phase might help in understanding two more topics among the “several building blocks of a comprehensive theory of the evolution of spoken language” indicated in their conclusion by Ackermann et al., that is, the foundation of the co-evolution of linguistic motor skills with the auditory skills underlying speech perception, and the possible phylogenetic interactions of protospeech production with referential capabilities., AbstractThe primate basal ganglia are fundamental to Ackermann et al.'s proposal. However, primates and rodents are models for human cognitive functions involving basal ganglia circuits, and links between striatal function and vocal communication come from songbirds. We suggest that the proposal is better integrated in cognitive and/or motor theories on spoken language origins and with more analogous nonhuman animal models., AbstractAckermann et al. disregard attested knowledge concerning aphasia, Parkinson disease, cortical-to-striatal circuits, basal ganglia, laryngeal phonation, and other matters. Their dual-pathway model cannot account for “what is special about the human brain.” Their human cortical-to-laryngeal neural circuit does not exist. Basal ganglia operations, enhanced by mutations on FOXP2, confer human motor-control, linguistic, and cognitive capabilities., AbstractAckermann et al. treat both genetic and paleoanthropological data too superficially to support their conclusions. The case of FOXP2 and Neanderthals is a prime example, which I will comment on in some detail; the issues are much more complex than they appear in Ackermann et al., AbstractAckermann et al. provide an informative neurological road-map to primate call communication. However, the proposed model for speech evolution inadequately integrates comparative primate evidence. Critically, great ape voiceless calls are explicitly rendered unimportant, leaving the proposed model deprived of behavioral feedstock and proximate selective drivers capable of triggering the neurological transformations described by the authors in the primate brain., AbstractWe support Ackermann et al.'s proposal that the cortico-basal ganglia circuits may play essential roles in the evolution of spoken language. Here we discuss further evidence indicating that the cortico-basal ganglia circuits may contribute to various aspects of spoken language including planning, learning, and controlling of speech in adulthood., AbstractAckermann et al. discuss the lack of evidence for vocal control in nonhuman primates. We suggest that nonhuman primates may be capable of achieving greater vocal control than previously supposed. In support of this assertion, we discuss new evidence that nonhuman primates are capable of modifying spectral features in their vocalizations., AbstractAckermann et al.'s phylogenetic account of speech argues that the basal ganglia imbue speech with emotive content. However, a body of work on auditory/emotive processing is inconsistent with attributing this function exclusively to these structures. The account further overlooks the possibility that the emotion-integration function may be at least in part mediated by the cortico-ponto-cerebellar system., AbstractThe gradual audiomotor evolution hypothesis is proposed as an alternative interpretation to the auditory timing mechanisms discussed in Ackermann et al.'s article. This hypothesis accommodates the fact that the performance of nonhuman primates is comparable to humans in single-interval tasks (such as interval reproduction, categorization, and interception), but shows differences in multiple-interval tasks (such as entrainment, synchronization, and continuation)., AbstractAckermann et al.'s arguments in the target article need sharpening and rethinking at both mechanistic and evolutionary levels. First, the authors' evolutionary arguments are inconsistent with recent evidence concerning nonhuman animal rhythmic abilities. Second, prosodic intonation conveys much more complex linguistic information than mere emotional expression. Finally, human adults' basal ganglia have a considerably wider role in speech modulation than Ackermann et al. surmise., AbstractRecent evidence from very young human infants' responses to human and nonhuman primate vocalizations offers new insights–and brings new questions–to the forefront for those who seek to integrate primate-general and human-specific mechanisms of acoustic communication with theories of language acquisition., AbstractIn this response to commentaries, we revisit the two main arguments of our target article. Based on data drawn from a variety of research areas–vocal behavior in nonhuman primates, speech physiology and pathology, neurobiology of basal ganglia functions, motor skill learning, paleoanthropological concepts–the target article, first, suggests a two-stage model of the evolution of the crucial motor prerequisites of spoken language within the hominin lineage: (1) monosynaptic refinement of the projections of motor cortex to brainstem nuclei steering laryngeal muscles, and (2) subsequent “vocal-laryngeal elaboration” of cortico-basal ganglia circuits, driven by human-specific FOXP2 mutations. Second, as concerns the ontogenetic development of verbal communication, age-dependent interactions between the basal ganglia and their cortical targets are assumed to contribute to the time course of the acquisition of articulate speech. Whereas such a phylogenetic reorganization of cortico-striatal circuits must be considered a necessary prerequisite for ontogenetic speech acquisition, the 30 commentaries–addressing the whole range of data sources referred to–point at several further aspects of acoustic communication which have to be added to or integrated with the presented model. For example, the relationships between vocal tract movement sequencing–the focus of the target article–and rhythmical structures of movement organization, the connections between speech motor control and the central-auditory and central-visual systems, the impact of social factors upon the development of vocal behavior (in nonhuman primates and in our species), and the interactions of ontogenetic speech acquisition–based upon FOXP2-driven structural changes at the level of the basal ganglia–with preceding subvocal stages of acoustic communication as well as higher-order (cognitive) dimensions of phonological development. Most importantly, thus, several promising future research directions unfold from these contributions–accessible to clinical studies and functional imaging in our species as well as experimental investigations in nonhuman primates., AbstractLanguage production is a multilevel phenomenon, and human capacities to communicate vocally progress from early forms, based on projections of motor cortex to brainstem nuclei, to complex elaborations, mediated by high-order cognition and fostered by socially mediated feedback., AbstractEarly human vocal development is characterized first by emerging control of phonation and later by prosodic and supraglottal articulation. The target article has missed the opportunity to use these facts in the characterization of evolution in language-specific brain mechanisms. Phonation appears to be the initial human-specific brain change for language, and it was presumably a key target of selection in early hominin evolution., AbstractContradicting new dual-pathway models of language evolution, cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry disambiguate uncertainties in affective prosody and propositional linguistic content of language production and comprehension, predictably setting limits on useful complexity of articulate phonic and/or signed speech. Such limits likely evolved to ensure public information is discriminated by intended communicants and safeguarded against the ecological pressures of social eavesdropping within and across phylogenetic boundaries.},

All males in a population sing the current version of the constantly evolving display and, within an ocean basin, populations sing similar songs; however, this sharing can be complex. In the western and central South Pacific region there is repeated cultural transmission of song types from eastern Australia to other populations eastward. Song sharing is hypothesized to occur through several possible mechanisms. Here, we present the first example of feeding ground song from the Southern Ocean Antarctic Area V and compare it to song from the two closest breeding populations. The early 2010 song contained at least four distinct themes; these matched four themes from the eastern Australian 2009 song, and the same four themes from the New Caledonian 2010 song recorded later in the year. This provides evidence for at least one of the hypothesized mechanisms of song transmission between these two populations, singing while on shared summer feeding grounds. In addition, the feeding grounds may provide a point of acoustic contact to allow the rapid horizontal cultural transmission of song within the western and central South Pacific region and the wider Southern Ocean.},

The vocal behaviour of each individual was monitored over several weeks. Acoustic analyses revealed that significant vocal convergence occurred in less than 1 week after the birds were initially exposed to each other. No single individual appeared to provide a vocal model that other birds copied. Acoustic differences appeared in the spectral structure of the D-note of this complex call, especially in the frequency difference between adjacent overtones and in the bandwidth. Both of these acoustic features are attributable to specific physiological mechanisms of production.

	abstract = {Vocal learning is well known among passerine and psittacine birds, but most data on mammals are equivocal. Specific benefits of vocal learning are poorly understood for most species. One case where vocal learning should be favoured by selection is where calls indicate group membership and group mates are unrelated. Female greater spear–nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, live in stable groups of unrelated bats and use loud, broadband calls to coordinate foraging movements of social group mates. Bats benefit from group foraging. Calls differ between female social groups and cave colonies, and playback experiments demonstrate that bats perceive these acoustic differences. Here I show that the group distinctive structure of calls arises through vocal learning. Females change call structure when group composition changes, resulting in increased similarity among new social group mates. Comparisons of transfers with age–matched half–sibs indicate that call changes are not simply due to maturation, the physical environment or heredity. These results suggest that studies testing vocal learning in mammals could profit by focusing on vocalizations that signify group membership.},

	abstract = {Learned song is among the best-studied models of animal communication. In oscine songbirds, where learned song is most prevalent, it is used primarily for intrasexual selection and mate attraction. Learning of a different class of vocal signals, known as contact calls, is found in a diverse array of species, where they are used to mediate social interactions among individuals. We argue that call learning provides a taxonomically rich system for studying testable hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of vocal learning. We describe and critically evaluate four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin and current function of vocal learning of calls, which propose that call learning (1) improves auditory detection and recognition, (2) signals local knowledge, (3) signals group membership, or (4) allows for the encoding of more complex social information. We propose approaches to testing these four hypotheses but emphasize that all of them share the idea that social living, not sexual selection, is a central driver of vocal learning. Finally, we identify future areas for research on call learning that could provide new perspectives on the origins and mechanisms of vocal learning in both animals and humans.},

In urban environments where sound transmissions are more likely to be masked by low-frequency anthropogenic noise, acoustic adaptations may be advantageous. However, minor modifications to a signal could affect its efficacy. While recent research has shown that there is divergence between songs from noisy and quiet areas, it is unknown whether these differences affect the response to the signal by its receivers. Here, we show that there is a difference in spectral aspects of rural and urban song in a common passerine, the great tit Parus major, at 20 sites across the UK. We also provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that such environmentally induced differences in song influence the response of male territory holders. Males from quiet territories exhibited a significantly stronger response when hearing song from another territory holder with low background noise than from those with high background noise. The opposite distinction in response intensity to homotypic versus heterotypic song was observed in males from noisy territories. This behavioural difference may intensify further signal divergence between urban and rural populations and raises important questions concerning signal evolution.},

At the same time, noise is ubiquitous in all habitats and is, therefore, likely to disturb animals, as well as humans, under many circumstances. However, both animals and humans have evolved diverse solutions to the background noise problem, and this chapter reviews recent advancements in studies of vocal adaptations to interference by background noise and relate these to fundamental issues in sound perception. The chapter starts with the discussion of sender's side by considering potential evolutionary shaping of species-specific signal characteristics and individual short‐term adjustments of signal features. Subsequently, it focuses on the receivers of signals and reviews their sensory capacities for signal detection, recognition, and discrimination and relates these issues to auditory scene analysis and the ecological concept of signal space. The data from studies on insects, anurans, birds, and mammals, including humans, and to a lesser extent available work on fish and reptiles is also discussed in the chapter.},

	abstract = {The Lombard effect, an involuntary rise in call amplitude in response to masking ambient noise, represents one of the most efficient mechanisms to optimize signal-to-noise ratio. The Lombard effect occurs in birds and mammals, including humans, and is often associated with several other vocal changes, such as call frequency and duration. Most studies, however, have focused on noise-dependent changes in call amplitude. It is therefore still largely unknown how the adaptive changes in call amplitude relate to associated vocal changes such as frequency shifts, how the underlying mechanisms are linked, and if auditory feedback from the changing vocal output is needed. Here, we examined the Lombard effect and the associated changes in call frequency in a highly vocal mammal, echolocating horseshoe bats. We analyzed how bandpass-filtered noise (BFN; bandwidth 20 kHz) affected their echolocation behavior when BFN was centered on different frequencies within their hearing range. Call amplitudes increased only when BFN was centered on the dominant frequency component of the bats’ calls. In contrast, call frequencies increased for all but one BFN center frequency tested. Both amplitude and frequency rises were extremely fast and occurred in the first call uttered after noise onset, suggesting that no auditory feedback was required. The different effects that varying the BFN center frequency had on amplitude and frequency rises indicate different neural circuits and/or mechanisms underlying these changes.},

Increasing numbers of studies are assessing how noise pollution affects animals across a range of scales, from individuals to communities, but the topic receiving the most research attention has been acoustic communication. Although there is now an extensive literature on how signalers might avoid potential masking from anthropogenic noise, the vast majority of the work has been conducted on birds and marine mammals. Fish represent more than half of all vertebrate species, are a valuable and increasingly utilized model taxa for understanding behavior, and provide the primary source of protein for \textgreater1 billion people and the principal livelihoods for hunderds of millions. Assessing the impacts of noise on fish is therefore of clear biological, ecological, and societal importance. Here, we begin by indicating why acoustic communication in fish is likely to be impacted by anthropogenic noise. We then use studies from other taxa to outline 5 main ways in which animals can alter their acoustic signaling behavior when there is potential masking due to anthropogenic noise and assess evidence of evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic noise sources to consider whether such changes are feasible in fish. Finally, we suggest directions for future study of fish acoustic behavior in this context and highlight why such research may allow important advances in our general understanding of the impact of this global pollutant.},

The purpose of this study was to clarify whether the Lombard reflex can be evoked during controlled vocalization in an animal model. In decerebrate cats, repetitive electrical stimulation was applied to the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) to evoke vocalization. Pure tone auditory stimulation was delivered through a loudspeaker. The activities of the laryngeal adductor muscle, diaphragm and external oblique abdominal muscle and the voice intensity were measured during PAG stimulation, in the presence and absence of the auditory stimulation. To clarify the effects of the auditory–laryngeal reflex on the activity of laryngeal adductor motoneurons, the amplitude of the laryngeal reflex evoked by single shock stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve was also measured during respiration, in the presence and absence of auditory stimulation. The sound made by the cats due to PAG-induced vocalization was augmented by exposure to auditory stimulation, and the activities of the laryngeal adductor muscle and external oblique abdominal muscle were also augmented. During respiration, auditory stimulation also increased the amplitude of the laryngeal reflex evoked in the laryngeal adductor muscle. These results demonstrate that the essential neuronal mechanisms for evoking the Lombard reflex exist within the brainstem.},

	abstract = {Urban noise can interfere with avian communication through masking, but birds can reduce this interference by altering their vocalizations. Although several experimental studies indicate that birds can rapidly change their vocalizations in response to sudden increases in ambient noise, none have investigated whether this is a learned response that depends on previous exposure. Black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) change the frequency of their songs in response to both fluctuating traffic noise and experimental noise. We investigated whether these responses to fluctuating noise depend on familiarity with noise. We confirmed that males in noisy areas sang higher-frequency songs than those in quiet areas, but found that only males in already-noisy territories shifted songs upwards in immediate response to experimental noise. Unexpectedly, males in more quiet territories shifted songs downwards in response to experimental noise. These results suggest that chickadees may require prior experience with fluctuating noise to adjust vocalizations in such a way as to minimize masking. Thus, learning to cope may be an important part of adjusting to acoustic life in the city.},

	abstract = {Some animals that use sound to communicate compensate for interference from background noise by adjusting the amplitude of their vocalizations as environmental noise levels vary. Territorial songbirds may have evolved a different strategy, since they can be expected to benefit from maximizing the amplitude of their songs to defend territories and attract females. We tested this hypothesis with calibrated measurements of the song level of male nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos. All birds increased the sound level of their songs in response to an increase in white noise broadcast to them. A second experiment revealed that noise in the spectral region of their own songs was most effective in inducing the birds to increase vocal intensity. These findings show that nightingales do not maximize song amplitude but regulate vocal intensity dependent on the level of masking noise. The adjustment of vocal amplitude may serve to maintain a specific signal-to-noise ratio that is favourable for signal production. Concurrently, increasing the intensity of songs can maintain a given active space for communication. Thus, vocal amplitude in a territorial songbird can be interpreted as a flexible trait, which is individually regulated according to ecological demands from signal transmission.

The caudal pontine brainstem, though rarely investigated, is one candidate area for such audio–vocal integration. We recorded neuronal activity in this area in awake, behaving squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) during vocal communication, using telemetric single-unit recording techniques. We found audio–vocal neurons at locations not described before, namely in the periolivary region of the superior olivary complex and the adjacent pontine reticular formation. They showed various responses to external sounds (noise bursts) and activity increases (excitation) or decreases (inhibition) to self-produced vocalizations, starting prior to vocal onset and continuing through vocalizations. In most of them, the responses to noise bursts and self-produced vocalizations were similar, with the only difference that neuronal activity started prior to vocal onset. About one-third responded phasically to noise bursts, independent of whether they increased or decreased their activity to vocalization. The activity of most audio–vocal neurons correlated with basic acoustic features of the vocalization, such as call duration and/or syllable structure. Auditory neurons near audio–vocal neurons showed significantly more frequent phasic response patterns than those in areas without audio–vocal activity. Based on these findings, we propose that audio–vocal neurons showing similar activity to external acoustical stimuli and vocalization play a role in olivocochlear regulation. Specifically, audio–vocal neurons with a phasic response to external auditory stimuli are candidates for the mediation of basal audio–vocal reflexes such as the Lombard reflex. Thus, our findings suggest that complex audio–vocal integration mechanisms exist in the ventrolateral pontine brainstem.},

The vocal imitation and reduced dispersal hypotheses are alternatives to explain this mismatch between vocal and genetic variation. We experimentally simulated dispersal in the yellow-naped amazon (Amazona auropalliata) by moving individuals within and across dialect boundaries in Costa Rica. One juvenile translocated across dialect boundaries altered its contact call to imitate the acoustic form of the local call six weeks post-release. In contrast, four adults translocated across dialect boundaries returned to their original capture site within 120 days, while five cross-dialect translocated adults who remained at the release site did not alter their contact calls. Translocated individuals were observed to show some segregation from resident flocks. The observation of vocal imitation by the juvenile bird supports the vocal imitation, whereas the behavior of adults is more consistent with the reduced dispersal hypotheses. Taken together, our results suggest that both post-dispersal learning by juveniles and high philopatry in adults could explain the stability of vocal dialects in the face of immigration and gene flow.},

All three groups showed similar production patterns when F1 was decreased; however, when F1 was increased, the Japanese groups did not compensate as much as the native English speakers.

Based on this evidence, we propose two principles that can be useful in evaluating the many and disparate empirical findings that bear on the nature of vocal production in nonhuman and human primates. One principle distinguishes production-first from reception-first vocal development, referring to the markedly different role of auditory-motor experience in each case. The second highlights a phenomenon dubbed dual neural pathways, specifically that when a species with an existing vocal system evolves a new functionally distinct vocalization capability, it occurs through emergence of a second parallel neural pathway rather than through expansion of the extant circuitry. With these principles as a backdrop, we review evidence of acoustic modification of calling associated with background noise, conditioning effects, audience composition, and vocal convergence and divergence in nonhuman primates. Although each kind of evidence has been interpreted to show flexible cognitively mediated control over vocal production, we suggest that most are more consistent with affectively grounded mechanisms. The lone exception is production of simple, novel sounds in great apes, which is argued to reveal at least some degree of volitional vocal control. If also present in early hominins, the cortically based circuitry surmised to be associated with these rudimentary capabilities likely also provided the substrate for later emergence of the neural pathway allowing volitional production in modern humans.

	abstract = {Mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are often used as behavioral readouts of internal states, to measure effects of social and pharmacological manipulations, and for behavioral phenotyping of mouse models for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms of rodent USV production. Here we discuss the available data to assess whether male mouse song behavior and the supporting brain circuits resemble those of known vocal non-learning or vocal learning species. Recent neurobiology studies have demonstrated that the mouse USV brain system includes motor cortex and striatal regions, and that the vocal motor cortex sends a direct sparse projection to the brainstem vocal motor nucleus ambiguous, a projection previously thought be unique to humans among mammals. Recent behavioral studies have reported opposing conclusions on mouse vocal plasticity, including vocal ontogeny changes in USVs over early development that might not be explained by innate maturation processes, evidence for and against a role for auditory feedback in developing and maintaining normal mouse USVs, and evidence for and against limited vocal imitation of song pitch. To reconcile these findings, we suggest that the trait of vocal learning may not be dichotomous but encompass a broad spectrum of behavioral and neural traits we call the continuum hypothesis, and that mice possess some of the traits associated with a capacity for limited vocal learning.},

The most accepted view is that speech perception depends on auditory-cognitive mechanisms specifically devoted to the analysis of speech sounds. An alternative view is that, crucial for speech perception, it is the activation of the articulatory (motor) gestures that generate these sounds. The listener understands the speaker when his/her articulatory gestures are activated (motor theory of speech perception). Here, by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we demonstrate that, during speech listening, there is an increase of motor-evoked potentials recorded from the listeners' tongue muscles when the presented words strongly involve, when pronounced, tongue movements. Although these data do not prove the motor theory of speech perception, they demonstrate for the first time that word listening produces a phoneme specific activation of speech motor centres.},

We examined the possibility that perception of speech, both auditory and visual, would also result in changes in the excitability of the motor system underlying speech production. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the face area of primary motor cortex to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the lip muscles. The size of the motor-evoked potentials was compared under the following conditions: listening to speech, listening to non-verbal sounds, viewing speech-related lip movements, and viewing eye and brow movements. Compared to control conditions, listening to and viewing speech enhanced the size of the motor-evoked potential. This effect was only seen in response to stimulation of the left hemisphere; stimulation of the right hemisphere produced no changes in motor-evoked potentials in any of the conditions. In a control experiment, the size of the motor-evoked potentials elicited in the muscles of the right hand did not differ among conditions, suggesting that speech-related changes in excitability are specific to the lip muscles. These results provide evidence that both auditory and visual speech perception facilitate the excitability of the motor system involved in speech production.},

In oscine songbirds, where learned song is most prevalent, it is used primarily for intrasexual selection and mate attraction. Learning of a different class of vocal signals, known as contact calls, is found in a diverse array of species, where they are used to mediate social interactions among individuals. We argue that call learning provides a taxonomically rich system for studying testable hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of vocal learning. We describe and critically evaluate four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin and current function of vocal learning of calls, which propose that call learning (1) improves auditory detection and recognition, (2) signals local knowledge, (3) signals group membership, or (4) allows for the encoding of more complex social information. We propose approaches to testing these four hypotheses but emphasize that all of them share the idea that social living, not sexual selection, is a central driver of vocal learning. Finally, we identify future areas for research on call learning that could provide new perspectives on the origins and mechanisms of vocal learning in both animals and humans.},

	abstract = {Expression of the immediate early gene protein Zenk (zif 268, egr-1, NGF1A,Krox24) was induced in forebrain auditory nuclei in a vocal learning parrot species, the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), when the subjects either listened to playbacks of an unfamiliar contact call or to a contact call with which they had been familiarized previously. Auditory nuclei included the Field L complex (L1, L2a, and L3), the neostriatum intermedium pars ventrolateralis (NIVL), the neostriatum adjacent to caudal nucleus basalis (peri-basalis or pBas), an area in the frontal lateral neostriatum (NFl), the supracentral nucleus of the lateral neostriatum (NLs), and the ventromedial hyperstriatum ventrale (HVvm). The latter three nuclei are main sources of auditory input to the vocal system. Two patterns of nuclear staining were induced by contact call stimulation—staining throughout cell nuclei, which was exhibited by at least some neurons in all areas examined except L2a and perinucleolar staining, which was the only kind of staining exhibited in field L2a. The different patterns of Zenk staining indicate that auditory stimulation may regulate the Zenk-dependent transcription of different subsets of genes in different auditory nuclei. The numbers of neurons expressing Zenk staining increased from seven- to 43-fold over control levels when the birds listened to a repeating unfamiliar call. Familiarization of the subjects with the call stimulus, through repeated playbacks, greatly reduced the induction of Zenk expression to the call when it was presented again after an intervening 24-h interval. To determine if neurons exhibiting contact call-driven Zenk expression project to the vocal control system, call stimulation was coupled with dextran amines pathway tracing. The results indicated that tracer injections in the vocal nucleus HVo (oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale), in fields lateral to HVo and in NLs labeled many Zenk-positive neurons in HVvm, NFl, and NLs. These results support the idea that, in these neurons, egr-1 couples auditory stimulation to the synthesis of proteins involved in either the storing of new perceptual engrams for vocal learning or the processing of novel and/or meaningful acoustic stimuli related to vocal learning or the context in which it occurs.},

One idea is that this correspondence is established at the level of single neurons that are active when the individual performs a particular gesture or observes a similar gesture performed by another individual. Although neurons that display a precise auditory–vocal correspondence could facilitate vocal communication, they have yet to be identified. Here we report that a certain class of neurons in the swamp sparrow forebrain displays a precise auditory–vocal correspondence. We show that these neurons respond in a temporally precise fashion to auditory presentation of certain note sequences in this songbird's repertoire and to similar note sequences in other birds' songs. These neurons display nearly identical patterns of activity when the bird sings the same sequence, and disrupting auditory feedback does not alter this singing-related activity, indicating it is motor in nature. Furthermore, these neurons innervate striatal structures important for song learning, raising the possibility that singing-related activity in these cells is compared to auditory feedback to guide vocal learning.},

	abstract = {Songbirds are capable of vocal learning and communication and are ideally suited to the study of neural mechanisms of complex sensory and motor processing. Vocal communication in a noisy bird colony and vocal learning of a specific song template both require the ability to monitor auditory feedback to distinguish self-generated vocalizations from external sounds and to identify mismatches between the developing song and a memorized template acquired from a tutor. However, neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal output have not been found in song-control areas despite intensive searching. Here we investigate feedback processing outside the traditional song system, in single auditory forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that were in a late developmental stage of song learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike responses during singing and during playback of the bird's own song, with song responses commonly leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief time-locked acoustic perturbations of auditory feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not be predicted from passive playback responses. Some neurons that responded to playback perturbations did not respond to song perturbations, which is reminiscent of sensory-motor mirror neurons. By contrast, some neurons were highly feedback sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a computational function of forebrain auditory areas may be to detect errors between actual feedback and mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such feedback-sensitive spikes could constitute the key signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to song disruptions or reinforce exploratory motor gestures for vocal learning.},

	abstract = {The brain basis for auditory working memory, the process of actively maintaining sounds in memory over short periods of time, is controversial. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants, we demonstrate that the maintenance of single tones in memory is associated with activation in auditory cortex. In addition, sustained activation was observed in hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that patterns of activity in auditory cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus distinguished the tone that was maintained in memory. Functional connectivity during maintenance was demonstrated between auditory cortex and both the hippocampus and inferior frontal cortex. The data support a system for auditory working memory based on the maintenance of sound-specific representations in auditory cortex by projections from higher-order areas, including the hippocampus and frontal cortex.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this work, we demonstrate a system for maintaining sound in working memory based on activity in auditory cortex, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, and functional connectivity among them. Specifically, our work makes three advances from the previous work. First, we robustly demonstrate hippocampal involvement in all phases of auditory working memory (encoding, maintenance, and retrieval): the role of hippocampus in working memory is controversial. Second, using a pattern classification technique, we show that activity in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus is specific to the maintained tones in working memory. Third, we show long-range connectivity of auditory cortex to hippocampus and frontal cortex, which may be responsible for keeping such representations active during working memory maintenance.},

At least two changes were necessary prerequisites for modern human speech abilities: (1) modification of vocal tract morphology, and (2) development of vocal imitative ability. Despite an extensive literature, attempts to pinpoint the timing of these changes using fossil data have proven inconclusive. However, recent comparative data from nonhuman primates have shed light on the ancestral use of formants (a crucial cue in human speech) to identify individuals and gauge body size. Second, comparative analysis of the diverse vertebrates that have evolved vocal imitation (humans, cetaceans, seals and birds) provides several distinct, testable hypotheses about the adaptive function of vocal mimicry. These developments suggest that, for understanding the evolution of speech, comparative analysis of living species provides a viable alternative to fossil data. However, the neural basis for vocal mimicry and for mimesis in general remains unknown.},

In the current study we analyse where the processing costs of regional dialects come from, a question that has not been answered yet. We quantify the proficiency of Basque–Spanish bilinguals who have different native dialects of Basque on many dimensions and test for costs at each of three levels of processing–phonemic discrimination, word recognition, and semantic processing. The ability to discriminate a dialect-specific contrast is affected by a bilingual's linguistic background less than lexical access is, and an individual's difficulty in lexical access is correlated with basic discrimination problems. Once lexical access is achieved, dialectal variation has little impact on semantic processing. The results are discussed in terms of the presence or absence of correlations between different processing levels. The implications of the results are considered for how models of spoken word recognition handle dialectal variation.},

This holds for speech motor control as well, where both auditory and somatosensory information have been shown to play a key role. Recent clinical research demonstrates that individuals with severe speech production deficits can show a dramatic improvement in fluency during online mimicking of an audiovisual speech signal suggesting the existence of a visuomotor pathway for speech motor control. Here we used fMRI in healthy individuals to identify this new visuomotor circuit for speech production. Participants were asked to perceive and covertly rehearse nonsense syllable sequences presented auditorily, visually, or audiovisually. The motor act of rehearsal, which is prima facie the same whether or not it is cued with a visible talker, produced different patterns of sensorimotor activation when cued by visual or audiovisual speech (relative to auditory speech). In particular, a network of brain regions including the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and several frontoparietal sensorimotor areas activated more strongly during rehearsal cued by a visible talker versus rehearsal cued by auditory speech alone. Some of these brain regions responded exclusively to rehearsal cued by visual or audiovisual speech. This result has significant implications for models of speech motor control, for the treatment of speech output disorders, and for models of the role of speech gesture imitation in development.},

Birds have no cortex, but recent studies in parrots and corvids show that their cognitive skills are on par with primates. These cognitive findings are accompanied by neurobiological discoveries that reveal avian and mammalian forebrains are homologous, and show similarities in connectivity and function down to the cellular level. But because birds have a large pallium, but no cortex, a specific cortical architecture cannot be a requirement for advanced cognitive skills. During the long parallel evolution of mammals and birds, several neural mechanisms for cognition and complex behaviors may have converged despite an overall forebrain organization that is otherwise vastly different., Cognition in corvids and parrots reaches the same level of excellence and diversity as in apes. Among others, bird cognition encompasses abilities such as delay of gratification, mental time travel, reasoning, metacognition, mirror self-recognition, theory of mind, and third-party intervention., The cerebrum of birds and mammals is homologous but very differently organized., Birds lack a neocortex but have instead several large pallial aggregations without apparent laminar structure. However, according to some scientists, these aggregations might correspond to cortical layers., Independent from each other, birds and mammals have developed similar brain organizations that could constitute the neural basis of their cognitive skills. Birds have a functional analog to the prefrontal cortex that generates executive functions. Their telencephalic connectome is highly similar to that of diverse mammalian species and they show a ‘hidden’ lamination that resembles cortical canonical circuits in parts of their sensory pallial territories.},

The present study tested the hypothesis that sensory attenuation mechanisms also underlie expression of the Lombard effect. Participants vocalized phonemes in time with a metronome, while auditory and visual feedback of their performance were manipulated or removed during the course of the trial. We demonstrate that providing a visual reference to calibrate somatosensory-based judgments of current vocal intensity resulted in reduced expression of the Lombard effect.

Most behavioural research and neuroimaging research in this area has concentrated on the effect of energetic maskers such as white noise on Lombard speech. Previous fMRI studies have argued that neural responses to speaking in noise are driven by the quality of auditory feedback—that is, the audibility of the speaker's voice over the masker. However, we also frequently produce speech in the presence of informational maskers such as another talker. Here, speakers read sentences over a range of maskers varying in their informational and energetic content: speech, rotated speech, speech modulated noise, and white noise. Subjects also spoke in quiet and listened to the maskers without speaking. When subjects spoke in masking sounds, their vocal intensity increased in line with the energetic content of the masker. However, the opposite pattern was found neurally. In the superior temporal gyrus, activation was most strongly associated with increases in informational, rather than energetic, masking. This suggests that the neural activations associated with speaking in noise are more complex than a simple feedback response.},

	abstract = {Trying to uncover the roots of human speech and language has been the premier motivation to study the signalling behaviour of nonhuman primates for several decades. Focussing on the question of whether we find evidence for linguistic reference in the production of nonhuman primate vocalizations, I will first discuss how the criteria used to diagnose referential signalling have changed over time, and will then turn to the paradigmatic case of semantic communication in animals, the alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus. A recent in-depth analysis of the original material revealed that, while the alarm calls could be well distinguished, calls of similar structure were also used in within- and between-group aggression. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the idea that calls denote objects in the environment. Furthermore, nonhuman primates show only minimal signs of vocal production learning, one key prerequisite for conventionalized and symbolic communication. In addition, the structure of calls in different populations or closely related species is highly conserved. In conclusion, any continuity between nonhuman primate and human communication appears to be found at the level of the processing of signals. Why and how the ancestors of our own species one day began to talk to each other continues to be an enigma. Future research should focus on changes in the neural structure supporting volitional control over vocalizations, the gene networks associated with vocal production, and the developmental processes involved in the integration of production and perception of vocalizations.},

Calls given by males from the well-known Gombe and Mahale populations typically consist of four different phases: an introduction, build-up, climax, and let-down. Recent observations suggest that chimpanzees living in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, consistently give calls that lack a build-up and are thus qualitatively distinguishable acoustically from those made by other East African conspecifics. We analyzed additional recordings from Mahale and Kibale to re-examine geographic variation in chimpanzee calls. Results indicate that males from both sites produce pant hoots containing all four parts of the call. Calls made by chimpanzees from the two populations, however, differ in quantitative acoustic measures. Specifically, males at Kibale initiate their calls with significantly longer elements and build-up over briefer periods at slower rates than individuals from Mahale. Kibale males also deliver acoustically less variable calls than chimpanzees at Mahale. Although climax elements do not differ between populations in any single acoustic feature, discriminant function analysis reveals that acoustic variables can be used in combination to assign calls to the correct population at rates higher than that expected by chance. Ecological factors related to differences in habitat acoustics, the sound environment of the local biota, and body size are likely to account for these observed macrogeographic variations in chimpanzee calls.},

	abstract = {This review centers on the neural mechanisms underlying the primate cognitive control of vocalizations, i.e. the capacity to regulate vocal productions in a goal-directed manner. In both human and non-human primates (NHPs), two main frontal brain regions are associated with top-down vocal control: a ventrolateral frontal region (VLF), comprising the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral premotor region; and a dorsomedial frontal region (DMF), comprising the mid-cingulate cortex, pre-supplementary and supplementary motor areas. These regions are cytoarchitectonically comparable across humans and NHPs and could serve generic functions in primate vocal control. Here, we first summarize the key anatomical properties of VLF and DMF regions as well as their involvements in the motor and cognitive control of vocalizations in both humans and NHPs. Finally, in light of the reviewed evidence, we discuss the existence of a primate VLF-DMF network and its generic functions in the cognitive control of vocalizations. We further suggest how this network and its functions may have changed across primate evolution to enable modern human speech.},

Flight call learning was found in all birds studied; learning of many other call types was observed in two genera. Additional evidence extends call learning to other carduelines bringing to eight the total number of genera in which call learning has been observed. Call learning is perhaps characteristic of subfamily Carduelinae, and the taxonomist should consider the possibility that learning may affect the patterns of all adult cardueline vocalizations. The taxonomic value of cardueline calls in particular and passerine calls in general is re-examined in light of this extensive call learning. It is suggested that the ontogenetic, learned modification in call pattern can be eliminated from the taxonomic analysis, and that calls may then be taxonomically valuable behavioral characters. The problem of homologizing behavior is discussed, with criteria for homology applied to two call types, both associated with call learning. Cardueline flight calls are autapoinorphic characters useful as species specific characters, while social/alarm calls are synapomorphic at the subfamilial level and can be used as taxonomic characters at the family level.},

Although some environmental noise is continuous, both biotic and abiotic noise can be intermittent, or even periodic. Interference from intermittent noise can be avoided if calls are timed to coincide with periods of silence, a capacity that is unambiguously present in insects, amphibians, birds, and humans. Surprisingly, we know virtually nothing about this fundamental capacity in nonhuman primates. Here we show that a New World monkey, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), can restrict calls to periodic silent intervals in loud white noise. In addition, calls produced during these silent intervals were significantly louder than calls recorded in silent baseline sessions. Finally, average call duration dropped across sessions, indicating that experience with temporally patterned noise caused tamarins to compress their calls. Taken together, these results show that in the presence of a predictable, intermittent environmental noise, cotton-top tamarins are able to modify the duration, timing, and amplitude of their calls to avoid acoustic interference.},

	abstract = {Vocal imitation is a phenotype that is unique to humans among all primate species, and so an understanding of its neural basis is critical in explaining the emergence of both speech and song in human evolution. Two principal neural models of vocal imitation have emerged from a consideration of nonhuman animals. One hypothesis suggests that putative mirror neurons in the inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis of Broca's area may be important for imitation. An alternative hypothesis derived from the study of songbirds suggests that the corticostriate motor pathway performs sensorimotor processes that are specific to vocal imitation. Using fMRI with a sparse event-related sampling design, we investigated the neural basis of vocal imitation in humans by comparing imitative vocal production of pitch sequences with both nonimitative vocal production and pitch discrimination. The strongest difference between these tasks was found in the putamen bilaterally, providing a striking parallel to the role of the analogous region in songbirds. Other areas preferentially activated during imitation included the orofacial motor cortex, Rolandic operculum, and SMA, which together outline the corticostriate motor loop. No differences were seen in the inferior frontal gyrus. The corticostriate system thus appears to be the central pathway for vocal imitation in humans, as predicted from an analogy with songbirds.},

Six university professors and 22 university students made short laboratory monologs in which they explained something that they knew well to a listener 6 m away. Seven students also described a map with the intention of correctly explaining directions to a listener who drew the path on a blank chart. Longer speech samples were made by 25 primary school teachers in classrooms. A tendency to increase the voicing periods as the RT increased was on average observed for the university professors, the school teachers, and the university students who described a map. These students also showed longer silence periods than the students who made short monologs. The recognized trends concerned voice professionals or subjects who were highly motivated to make themselves understood in a perturbed speaking situation. Nonparametric statistical tests, which were applied to detect the differences in distributions of voicing and silence periods, have basically supported the findings.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the effects of talker-to-listener distance (TLD) on tone and examines its impact on tone perception by both native listeners and second language learners.

Speakers naturally adjust vocal effort to talk to people at different distances, which leads to changes not only in intensity, duration and formant frequencies, but also in fundamental frequency (f0). Fundamental frequency is the primary acoustic cue that differentiates Mandarin lexical tones from one another. This study aims to answer the question of whether changes in f0 as a function of TLD affect tone perception by native (L1) and second language (L2) listeners. If so, what are the specific changes that have an impact on tone perception?

The production study investigates the acoustic correlates of the effects of TLD on tone, using 7959 monosyllabic Mandarin speech files recorded by three speakers under 11 levels of TLD. The perception study explores the effects of TLD on L1 and L2 tone perception by 2 native listeners and 52 L2 listeners.

The effects of TLD on speech production are systematic, and we present models and analyses with sufficient detail to simulate these effects. Intensity, duration, and initial and maximum f0 increase along with TLD, while time-normalized toneshapes remain invariant. The results of the perception study show that native listeners' performance is robust under changes in TLD, while L2 listeners' perception of tone interacts with TLD. One significant finding is that tone 3 recognition improves with TLD.

This work investigates the relationship between speech production and perception when acoustic attributes change naturally in response to the demands of speech communication. The results have potential applications in speech synthesis, pronunciation training and second language testing.},

	abstract = {In humans, whispering has evolved as a counteractive strategy against eavesdropping. Some evidence for whisper-like behavior exists in a few other species, but has not been reported in non-human primates. We discovered the first evidence of whisper-like behavior in a non-human primate, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), in the course of investigating their use of human-directed mobbing calls. We exposed a family of captive cotton-top tamarins to a supervisor who previously elicited a strong mobbing response. Simultaneous audio–video recordings documented the animals' behavioral and vocal responses in the supervisor's presence and absence. Rather than exhibiting a mobbing response and producing loud human-directed mobbing calls, the tamarins exhibited other anti-predator behaviors and produced low amplitude vocalizations that initially eluded our detection. A post-hoc analysis of the data was conducted to test a new hypothesis—the tamarins were reducing the amplitude of their vocalizations in the context of exposure to a potential threat. Consistent with whisper-like behavior, the amplitude of the tamarins' vocalizations was significantly reduced only in the presence of the supervisor. Due to its subtle properties, this phenomenon may have eluded detection in this species. Increasing evidence of whisper-like behavior in non-human species suggests that such low amplitude signaling may represent a convergence in a communication strategy amongst highly social and cooperative species.

Rapid expansion of human populations, accompanied by noise that comes with industrialization and motorized transportation, poses a threat for many acoustically communicating species. Although a significant amount of effort has been made exploring the responses of organisms inhabiting marine and terrestrial environments to elevated noise levels, relatively little has been directed toward organisms inhabiting small, lotic, freshwater systems. The aim of this study was to determine what effect elevated noise levels have on acoustic signals and inter-fish distance during sound production in the Blacktail Shiner, Cyprinella venusta. We hypothesized, based on the behaviors of other vocal organisms, that C. venusta would compensate for elevated noise levels by decreasing distance between sender and receiver, increasing signal amplitude (Lombard effect), or by changing temporal patterns to increase call redundancy. Using an experimental approach, we found that C. venusta altered several acoustic components under noisy conditions. Most notably, spectral levels of acoustic signals were increased in background noise, indicating presence of the Lombard effect in fishes. Inter-fish distance was typically not different between noisy and quiet conditions, although one circumstance did show a significantly smaller inter-fish distance under noisy conditions.},

We conducted playback experiments to assess the effect of the burrows occupied by the frogs Eupsophus emiliopugini and E. calcaratus on the amplitude of outgoing vocalizations. In addition, we evaluated the influence of these cavities on the reception of externally generated sounds potentially interfering with conspecific communication, namely, the vocalizations emitted by four syntopic species of anurans (E. emiliopugini, E. calcaratus, Batrachyla antartandica, and Pleurodema thaul) and the nocturnal owls Strix rufipes and Glaucidium nanum. Eupsophus advertisement calls emitted from within the burrows experienced average amplitude gains of 3–6 dB at 100 cm from the burrow openings. Likewise, the incoming vocalizations of amphibians and birds were amplified on average above 6 dB inside the cavities. The amplification of internally broadcast Eupsophus vocalizations favors signal detection by nearby conspecifics. Reciprocally, the amplification of incoming conspecific and heterospecific signals facilitates the detection of neighboring males and the monitoring of the levels of potentially interfering biotic noise by resident frogs, respectively.},

Sixteen mothers (5 Sri Lankan Tamil, 5 Tagalog, 6 Korean) were recorded in their homes during natural interactions with their young infants, and adults, over the course of 12 months beginning when the infant was 4 months old. Regression models indicated that the difference between infant- and adult-directed speech rates decreased across the first year of infants' development. Models of pitch revealed predicted differences between infant- and adult-directed speech but did not provide evidence for cross-linguistic or longitudinal effects within the time period investigated for the three languages.

The listeners exhibited an intelligibility benefit in the predictable context relative to the other two semantic contexts, regardless of talker dialect. However, differences in intelligibility between the dialects were reduced in the unpredictable and anomalous contexts relative to the predictable context, suggesting greater online adaptation to dialect variation in the unpredictable and anomalous contexts than the predictable context. These results are consistent with the finding that dialect differences may be attenuated in production in low predictability contexts, and suggest that perceptual dialect adaptation is affected by fine‐grained intratalker acoustic variation.},

In addition, more extreme dialect-specific forms are produced in semantically predictable contexts, and less extreme forms (more standard forms) in unpredictable contexts. This study investigated the interactions between predictability and speaking style on Southern American English monophthongization of the vowel /aj/. The Midland dialect of American English served as the comparison. Participants read a set of sentences with monosyllabic target words in sentence-final position. Target words varied in semantic predictability based on the preceding sentential context. Each set of sentences was produced twice by each participant—first as if talking to a friend (“plain” speech) and again as if talking to a non-native or hearing impaired listener (“clear” speech). The duration, dispersion, and trajectory length of the vowel in each target word were measured. Preliminary results suggest that, as expected, Southern /aj/ has a shorter trajectory length than Midland /aj/, and in both dialects, /aj/ has a shorter trajectory length in clear speech than plain speech. However, these processes do not interact with each other or with semantic predictability, suggesting that style and predictability effects are independent of the realization of some dialect variants.},

Previous research on the effects of semantic predictability has shown that vowels in high semantic predictability contexts are temporally and spectrally reduced compared to vowels in low semantic predictability contexts. In the current study, an analysis of vowel duration confirmed temporal reduction in the high predictability condition. An analysis of vowel formant structure and vowel space dispersion revealed overall spectral reduction for the Southern talkers. For the Northern talkers, more extreme Northern Cities shifting occurred in the high predictability condition than in the low predictability condition. No effects of semantic predictability were observed for the Midland talkers. These findings suggest an interaction between semantic and indexical factors in vowel reduction processes.},

Since the mid-1960s, numerous computational algorithms have been proposed to normalize formant frequency measures and reduce the effects of talker-specific variability. These algorithms vary widely in their conceptualization: some require samples of the entire vowel space (vowel extrinsic), whereas others can be conducted on a single vowel class (vowel intrinsic); some are based on a single-scale factor to align broad classes of talkers (such as females and males), whereas others use scale factors and/or vowel space ranges for individual talkers to align their vowel systems in the same acoustic–phonetic space. In this study, an overview of the most commonly used normalization algorithms is provided and the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches are discussed.},

Speaker perceptions of language variation within Ohio were collected from eighty-nine visitors to a science museum in Columbus, Ohio. Participant responses reflect Ohio’s complex dialect situation, dividing the northern and southern areas of the state out from a purportedly neutral, normative center. Accent-free speakers are positioned in central Ohio cities and presented as racially unmarked, while Southern, rural speakers and African American, young, urban speakers are presented as stigmatized and linguistically deficient Others. This stigma contrasts strikingly with the value-free discussion of otherwise unmarked speakers in northern Ohio, whose language differences, when noted, are presented less negatively, marked as less widely known, and, in some cases, downplayed as idiosyncratic variation. These results suggest that, for Ohio speakers, the North Midland/Inland North boundary is incompletely enregistered and would therefore be a promising site for the examination of enregisterment in progress and of the strategies speakers use to try to counter potential enregisterment.},

The current study examines northern Ohioans’ orientation to this construct within a larger understanding of their sociolinguistic imagining of Ohio. Northerners are found to share many language ideologies with other Ohioans, including a focus on north-to-south variation, an emphasis on rural versus urban language difference, and a belief in the local existence of unaccented, educated, normative speech. They differ from other Ohioans in sometimes conceptualizing urban speech as standard, failing to mark central Ohio as a distinct region, and subdividing the northeast (their own region) in a Cleveland-centered small region and a larger northeast corner of the state., Most importantly, they differ from central Ohioans in their treatment of the linguistic difference between central and northern Ohio, i.e., the Inland North/Midland dialect boundary (Labov, Ash \& Boberg 2006). Forty-two percent of northerners and 52 percent of others fail to construct a perceptual boundary between central and northeast Ohio, while 27 percent and 48 percent respectively indicate the north as the divergent speech area. Northerners differ, however, in having a third group (31 percent), who position their own speech as normative and the central Ohio speech as marked, counter to the discourses of central Ohioans. These results support Agha’s (2007) point that individuals’ stakes in particular reflexive models are a key influence on models’ circulation and further show the importance of “unremarkable” as a context-bound and often valuable sociolinguistic meaning, rather than a lack of meaning.},

The procedures were compared on how effectively they (a) preserve phonemic information, (b) preserve information about the talker’s regional background (or sociolinguistic information), and (c) minimize anatomical/physiological variation in acoustic representations of vowels. Recordings were made for 80 female talkers and 80 male talkers of Dutch. These talkers were stratified according to their gender and regional background. The normalization procedures were applied to measurements of the fundamental frequency and the first three formant frequencies for a large set of vowel tokens. The normalization procedures were evaluated through statistical pattern analysis. The results show that normalization procedures that use information across multiple vowels (“vowel-extrinsic” information) to normalize a single vowel token performed better than those that include only information contained in the vowel token itself (“vowel-intrinsic” information). Furthermore, the results show that normalization procedures that operate on individual formants performed better than those that use information across multiple formants (e.g., “formant-extrinsic” F2-F1).F2-F1).{\textless}math altimg="eq-00001.gif" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mtext \textgreaterF2-F1).{\textless}/mtext \textgreater \textless/math \textgreater},

We conducted a systematic review that addresses these questions using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative review of behavioural, computational modelling, non-human animal, brain damage/disorder, electrical stimulation/recording, and neuroimaging research suggests that distributed brain regions involved in producing speech play specific, dynamic, and contextually determined roles in speech perception. The quantitative review employed region and network based neuroimaging meta-analyses and a novel text mining method to describe relative contributions of nodes in distributed brain networks. Supporting the qualitative review, results show a specific functional correspondence between regions involved in non-linguistic movement of the articulators, covertly and overtly producing speech, and the perception of both nonword and word sounds. This distributed set of cortical and subcortical speech production regions are ubiquitously active and form multiple networks whose topologies dynamically change with listening context. Results are inconsistent with motor and acoustic only models of speech perception and classical and contemporary dual-stream models of the organization of language and the brain. Instead, results are more consistent with complex network models in which multiple speech production related networks and subnetworks dynamically self-organize to constrain interpretation of indeterminant acoustic patterns as listening context requires.},

Shapes, orientations, and proximities of pairs of vowel distributions involved in phonological oppositions are modeled using best-fit ellipses (in F1 x F2 space) and ellipsoids (F1 x F2 x duration). Overlap fractions computed for each pair suggest that spectral and temporal features interact differently in the three varieties and oppositions. Under a two-dimensional analysis, two of three American English oppositions show no overlap; the third shows partial overlap. All Jamaican Creole oppositions exhibit complete overlap when F1 and F2 alone are modeled, but no or partial overlap with incorporation of a factor for duration. Jamaican English three-dimensional overlap fractions resemble two-dimensional results for American English. A multidimensional analysis tool such as SOAM appears to provide a more objective basis for simultaneously investigating spectral and temporal relations within vowel systems. Normalization methods and the SOAM method are described in an extended appendix.},

The present two-part experiment examined intraspeaker and interspeaker variability in speakers of Jamaican Creole and Jamaican English. IDS and Lombard speech showed similar adjustments in two parameters (F0 and intensity), and IDS and Citation speech showed the greatest spectral differences. This result is important because it shows that while one or two acoustic parameters may be crucial characteristics of a type of exaggerated speech, task production involved the systematic adjustment of a complex set of continuous acoustic parameters. Taken together, the acoustic outcomes for the types of perturbations investigated here allow the tasks to be arranged along a continuum. These adjustments resemble patterns associated with the manipulation of sociolinguistic markers reported in sociophonetic studies of “style-shifting.” We argue that the two phenomena may be treated under a unified account of intraspeaker variability that builds upon the sociolinguistic concept of Audience Design.},

These effects were robust across two English vowel pairs (mid–front and low–front) and for two listener groups (mono-dialectal and multi-dialectal). However, both the most robust facilitation and the most robust inhibition were observed for the mid–front vowel words with few phonological competitors for the mono-dialectal listener group. The mid–front vowel targets were acoustically more distinct than the low–front vowel targets, suggesting that acoustic–phonetic similarity leads to stronger lexical competition and less robust facilitation and inhibition. The multi-dialectal listeners had more prior exposure to multiple different dialects than the mono-dialectal group, suggesting that long-term exposure to linguistic variability contributes to a more flexible processing strategy in which lexical competition extends over a longer period of time, leading to less robust facilitation and inhibition.},

However, the extent to which this important source of variation affects speech processing is largely unknown. In a series of four experiments, we examined the effects of dialect variation on speech intelligibility in noise and the effects of noise on perceptual dialect classification. Results revealed that, on the one hand, dialect-specific differences in speech intelligibility were more pronounced at harder signal-to-noise ratios, but were attenuated under more favorable listening conditions. Listener dialect did not interact with talker dialect; for all listeners, at a range of noise levels, the General American talkers were the most intelligible and the Mid-Atlantic talkers were the least intelligible. Dialect classification performance, on the other hand, was poor even with only moderate amounts of noise. These findings suggest that at moderate noise levels, listeners are able to adapt to dialect variation in the acoustic signal such that some cross-dialect intelligibility differences are neutralized, despite relatively poor explicit dialect classification performance. However, at more difficult noise levels, participants cannot effectively adapt to dialect variation in the acoustic signal and cross-dialect differences in intelligibility emerge for all listeners, regardless of their dialect.},

Les petits des deux sexes émettent des cris, mais les femelles de plus de 1 an le font rarement. Les mâles qui ont atteint leur maturité sexuelle sont les animaux les plus vocaux. Deux mâles adultes ont produit des sons qui imitaient un mot ou plusieurs mots anglais et même des locutions, ce qui est remarquable puisqu'il existe peu d'exemples d'apprentissage vocal chez les mammifères. Bien que semblables par plusieurs points aux autres cris de phoques, ces sons semblables à des mots contenaient un certain nombre de caractéristiques de la parole humaine. Nous croyons que les phoques communs mâles imitent probablement les cris d'autres mâles en nature.[Traduit par le journal]},

Here, an analysis of the English sibilants /s/ and /ʃ/ in a large corpus of caregivers’ speech to another adult and to their infant suggests that consonantal categories are indeed enhanced, even after controlling for typical IDS prosodic characteristics.},

In dolphins, this ability is well documented in captivity but poorly studied in the wild, and little is known of its role in natural social behavior. This study documents the previously unknown phenomenon of whistle convergence among habituated free-living male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.). Over a 4yr study period, three male subjects formed an alliance, spending most of their time together and cooperating to herd females. Within individuals, whistle repertoires were more variable than expected based on previous studies, mostly performed with captive dolphins, but became less so during the course of the study. Among individuals, the distinctiveness of individual repertoires decreased such that the three males were virtually indistinguishable by the end of the study. Initially, some whistle types were shared. By the end of the study, the three males had formed a close alliance, and had all converged on one particular shared whistle form which they had rarely produced before forming the alliance. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the prevailing ‘signature whistle’ hypothesis, as well as possible mechanisms and functional significance of whistle convergence among cooperating males.},

In rejecting this dichotomy, we instead assert that producing and understanding are interwoven, and that this interweaving is what enables people to predict themselves and each other. We start by noting that production and comprehension are forms of action and action perception. We then consider the evidence for interweaving in action, action perception, and joint action, and explain such evidence in terms of prediction. Specifically, we assume that actors construct forward models of their actions before they execute those actions, and that perceivers of others' actions covertly imitate those actions, then construct forward models of those actions. We use these accounts of action, action perception, and joint action to develop accounts of production, comprehension, and interactive language. Importantly, they incorporate well-defined levels of linguistic representation (such as semantics, syntax, and phonology). We show (a) how speakers and comprehenders use covert imitation and forward modeling to make predictions at these levels of representation, (b) how they interweave production and comprehension processes, and (c) how they use these predictions to monitor the upcoming utterances. We show how these accounts explain a range of behavioral and neuroscientific data on language processing and discuss some of the implications of our proposal.},

	abstract = {One key aspect of face-to-face communication concerns the differences that may exist between speakers’ native regional accents. This paper focuses on the characterization of regional phonological variation in a conversational setting. A new, interactive task was designed in which 12 pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative game leading them to produce a number of purpose-built names. In each game, the participants were native speakers of Southern French and Northern French, respectively. How the names were produced by each of the two participants was automatically determined from the recordings using ASR techniques and a pre-established set of possible regional variants along five phonological dimensions. A naive Bayes classifier was then applied to these phonetic forms, with a view to differentiating the speakers’ native regional accents. The results showed that native regional accent was correctly recognized for 79\% of the speakers. These results also revealed or confirmed the existence of accent-dependent differences in how segments are phonetically realized, such as the affrication of /d/ in /di/ sequences. Our data allow us to better characterize the phonological and phonetic patterns associated with regional varieties of French on a large scale and in a natural, interactional situation.},

Perceptions of masculinity and sexual orientation represent a well-studied area on sociolinguistic perception, offering many variables with potentially relevant social meanings. This study examines social perceptions of guises created by intersecting three masculinity-relevant variables: pitch, /s/-fronting or backing, and (ING). First, 110 online respondents provided descriptions and naturalness ratings of speech samples that were digitially modified to include the different variants; next, 175 respondents rated the speakers on six-point scales based on the terms “smart,” “knowledgeable,” “masculine,” “gay,” “friendly,” “laid-back,” “country,” “educated,” and “confident.” The results showed that /s/-fronting carries strong social meaning across multiple speakers and other linguistic cues, making speakers sound less masculine, more gay and less competent. As documented elsewhere, use of the (ING) variants -ing and -in made speakers sound more or less competent, respectively. The combination of /s/-fronting and (ING), and, independently, /s/-backing, showed more complex effects, shifting relationships between multiple percepts. Taken together, these results provide some support for style-based sociolinguistic models, but also underline the need for more sophisticated statistical treatments of covariation in social perception.},

Through such access their relational identities are presupposed and creatively (trans)formed in interaction. We work through several classic examples of indexicality well-known in the literature of sociolinguistics, the clarification of which can be enhanced by using the concept of indexical order, viz., ‘T/V’ deference-indexicality, speech levels, indexically significant variation in phonetics informed by a standard phonological register.

The present study accounts for certain aspects of the dialect contact maintained between the standard Castilian Spanish and nonstandard varieties in Spain. This ongoing contact situation normally yields cases of, more often, dialect obsolescence together with standardization and leveling, on the one hand, or, conversely, and less often, survival processes of dialect maintenance, on the other.

This paper addresses the gap by investigating the stylistic use of falsetto phonation. Focusing on the speech of Heath, a speaker exhibiting considerable cross-situational variation, I show that when attending a barbecue with friends, Heath's falsetto is more frequent, longer, and characterized by higher fundamental frequency (f0) levels and wider f0 ranges. Advancing recent approaches to variation which treat linguistic features as stylistic resources for constructing social meaning, I draw on an analysis of the discourse contexts in which falsetto appears to illustrate that the feature carries expressive connotations. This meaning is employed to construct a ‘diva’ persona and may also participate in building a gay identity.},

The first of these includes the investigation of age- and sex-specific formant frequency patterns in the monophthongs. The second, the investigation of fundamental frequency and formant frequency data using the critical band rate (bark) scale and a number of acoustic-phonetic dimensions of the monophthongs from an age- and sex-specific perspective. These acoustic-phonetic dimensions include: vowel spaces and distances from speaker centroids; frequency differences between the formant frequencies of males and females; vowel openness/closeness and frontness/backness; the degree of vocal effort; and formant frequency ranges. Both approaches reveal both age- and sex-specific development patterns which also appear to be dependent on whether vowels are peripheral or nonperipheral. The developmental emergence of these sex-specific differences are discussed with reference to anatomical, physiological, sociophonetic, and culturally determined factors. Some directions for further investigation into the age-linked sex differences in speech across the lifespan are also proposed.},

Focus was on the phonetic variants used for (t) in word-medial and word-final prevocalic contexts since it is known that these variants display clear sociolinguistic patterning in the adult community. Variant usage in CDS was found to differ markedly from that in interadult speech. Effects were also found with respect to the age and gender of the children being addressed. Speech to girls generally contained more standard variants than speech to boys, which, by contrast, contained higher rates of vernacular variants. The differentiation by gender was most apparent for the youngest children. The findings are assessed in comparison to other studies of CDS. It has previously been claimed that modifications made in the CDS register help children to learn linguistic structures and also to learn that speech is a social activity. Our findings suggest that CDS may play an additional role, providing boys and girls as young as 2;0 with differential opportunities to learn the social-indexical values of sociolinguistic variables.},

The first wave of variation studies established broad correlations between linguistic variables and the macrosociological categories of socioeconomic class, gender, ethnicity, and age. The second wave employed ethnographic methods to explore the local categories and configurations that inhabit, or constitute, these broader categories. In both waves, variation was seen as marking social categories. This article sets out a theoretical foundation for the third wave, arguing that (a) variation constitutes a robust social semiotic system, potentially expressing the full range of social concerns in a given community; (b) the meanings of variables are underspecified, gaining more specific meanings in the context of styles, and (c) variation does not simply reflect, but also constructs, social meaning and hence is a force in social change.},

The spatial boundaries of /l/-vocalization in Swiss German are suspected to have been expanding since being described in the Linguistic Atlas of German-Speaking Switzerland in the middle of the 20th century. The present study assesses the overall expansion of /l/-vocalization by means of a rapid anonymous survey in 20 urban regional centers situated just beyond the traditional boundaries of /l/-vocalization highlighted by the Atlas. Results show that the expansion of /l/-vocalization mainly progresses in southeasterly, southerly, and westerly directions, but with much less success to the north and northwest, where the equally influential dialectal areas of Basel and Zürich seem to exert opposing influences. Further analysis of the data indicates that somewhat differing constraint hierarchies are at work in the different places to which vocalization has diffused.},

This makes sense – given that even casual observation tells us that humans behave differently at different points in the life cycle, it is quite reasonable to take age into account when investigating human behavior. In turn, the use of age as a variable has led to a wide range of methods and analytical tools that rely on the use of age (e.g., the apparent time construct in sociolinguistics). However, it turns out that even though age is often treated in a rather simple way, it is actually a complicated concept that can be difficult to pin down precisely and that the usual linguistic view of age as a simple reflection of the linear passage of time is lacking. That fact has repercussions for how linguists should deal with age, including not just issues like how to record metadata relating to it, but even methodological concerns such as how to do the initial elicitation in the first place.},

I review research on the linguistic perception and production of gender and sexuality that has adopted an intersectional perspective to date and argue that while certain aspects of the theory have long had a foothold in work in this area, the field's engagement with the full ramifications of intersectionality as an analytical framework has been partial. I conclude with suggestions about how to anchor a more comprehensive approach to intersectionality in sociolinguistic research.},

Two central questions in the study of language contact and change are (1) whether social or linguistic factors are primary in predicting the outcomes of contact; and (2) whether change in the context of contact is a foregone conclusion. Quantitative studies of sociolinguistic variation provide an effective means of observing change in progress, but the majority of such studies have focused on monolingual speakers/communities. This article gives a brief summary of the study of language contact in variationist sociolinguistics before turning to a discussion of the types of data and approaches best suited to answering the question of how and when contact causes change in multilingual communities. Recognizing that the description of a multilingual community involves more social parameters and more inter-individual variation than a monolingual one, this article focuses on a core list of social factors to consider in studies of variation and change in multilingual communities, organized so that possible intersections may also be considered.},

While early stratificational models formulated on the basis of socioeconomic indicators such as income, occupation, and area of residence revealed compelling patterns of linguistic variation, they were critiqued for their lack of explanatory power at the interactional level and for their marginalization of those without paid employment. Subsequent models have employed cross-disciplinary concepts such as the linguistic market, social networks, and communities of practice, prioritizing local social distinctions that are understood to reflect or even constitute abstract structural categories such as ‘working class’ or ‘middle class’. It is argued that a full socioeconomic class paradigm for sociolinguistics would also theorize class at the aggregate level, and to this end, sociological class models may prove useful. Contemporary sociological class analysis at the level of social practice offers additional avenues for interfacing with sociology.},

With this end in mind, we suggest some brief, quantitative indices that might be appropriate and useful for documenting social psychological variables for contemporary and future purposes. The first construct considered is ethnolinguistic vitality, which refers to those characteristics that make a language group likely to behave as an active collective entity in language contact situations. The second is language attitudes, which refer to the feelings and beliefs that people hold with regard to their own and others' languages and the associated language community/ies. The third is ethnolinguistic identity, which refers to the manner and extent to which individuals define themselves as members of an ethnolinguistic group. Although we maintain that more extensive, detailed coding should be included in sociolinguistic archives, we suggest that these three sets of indices should be minimally included in a battery to assess a speaker's ethnolinguistic orientation.},

This study examines the production of released /t/ by six prominent U.S. political figures, as well as the social meanings listeners attribute to the variant. Employing a matched guise technique facilitated by digital stimulus manipulation, we find that the social meanings associated with released /t/ are constrained by linguistic and social factors. Regarding the former, word-medial /t/ releases carry stronger social meanings than those appearing word-finally. With respect to social factors, listener interpretations vary according to the identity of the speaker and knowledge of how frequently particular speakers produce /t/ releases. Thus, even though conventionalized associations between linguistic forms and meanings can be drawn upon to construct articulate personas, not all speakers can do so with equal effectiveness.},

Two experiments were designed for testing language attitudes, one toward intervocalic /d/ deletion and one toward syllable-final /r/deletion. The findings of this research support the hypothesis according to which retention of syllable-final /r/ is perceived as a prestigious variant in Venezuelan Spanish. However, our findings do not show a strong attitudinal evaluation in favor oïlàl retention. These results provide a contribution to the study of language attitudes using a perceptual task, a practice that is not very commonly used to assess a linguistic variable. The findings show that production studies present useful evidence, but may not necessarily reflect a speaker's evaluation of linguistic variants.},

Fifteen Andalusian Spaniards were interviewed using a semistructured interview schedule. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze the data guided by identity process theory and the ethnolinguistic vitality framework. The following themes are outlined: (a) threatened linguistic identity and vitality (re)constructions; (b) relocating the sociopsychological value in one's linguistic variety; and (c) multiple linguistic identities: threat and management. This article elucidates how perceived threats to ethnolinguistic vitality can induce identity threat. Weak social status may jeopardize self-esteem, while weak institutional support may threaten self-efficacy. The belonging principle may be vulnerable to threat in contexts in which the stigmatized group has minority status. Relevant sociolinguistic concepts are discussed in relation to the intrapsychic level of identity functioning. Potential strategies for coping are discussed.},

A matched guise test was conducted among students in Barcelona in 1980 and again in 1987 to gauge changes in attitudes toward Catalan and Castilian. Conflict between positive status and negative solidarity values of Catalan for nonnative speakers found in 1980 appears to be resolved in 1987. Three aspects of public language policy have attenuated ethnic constraints against nonnative use of Catalan, but further changes in social relations may be necessary to alter patterns of language choice.},

	abstract = {In a world where most individuals speak more than one language and most languages are in contact with other languages, the study of language in its social context must take into account language contact. Two central questions in the study of language contact and change are (1) whether social or linguistic factors are primary in predicting the outcomes of contact; and (2) whether change in the context of contact is a foregone conclusion. Quantitative studies of sociolinguistic variation provide an effective means of observing change in progress, but the majority of such studies have focused on monolingual speakers/communities. This article gives a brief summary of the study of language contact in variationist sociolinguistics before turning to a discussion of the types of data and approaches best suited to answering the question of how and when contact causes change in multilingual communities. Recognizing that the description of a multilingual community involves more social parameters and more inter-individual variation than a monolingual one, this article focuses on a core list of social factors to consider in studies of variation and change in multilingual communities, organized so that possible intersections may also be considered.},

	abstract = {The linguistic map of Amazonia presents a startling jumble of languages and language families. While some families – most notably Carib, Arawak, Macro-Jê, and Tupí– are distributed widely throughout the region, their spread is interspersed with many dozens of tiny, localized families and language isolates, particularly in the Amazonian periphery. At the same time, distributions of lexical, grammatical, and phonological features suggest that this linguistic patchwork is overlaid in places by contact regions, where multilingualism has fostered lexical and/or structural resemblances among languages. This complex distribution of languages and linguistic features presents many challenges to our understanding of Amazonian prehistory. How did Amazonia's language families arrive at their present distribution? Why did some families spread over huge distances, while others came to occupy only tiny geographical pockets or are limited to a single language? What kinds of interactions among peoples led to the formation of contact zones, and how are these regions defined? Complicating these questions further is the fact that very little is known about many Amazonian languages, and relationships among them are in many cases a matter of conjecture. This article surveys our current understanding of language classification and language contact in Amazonia, and addresses various perspectives concerning the implications of these relationships for Amazonian prehistory.},

	abstract = {Studying dialectal contact offers linguists an opportunity to critically examine some of our most basic assumptions about language. In particular, careful consideration of geographically constrained patterns of linguistic variation highlights the limitations of named language varieties as tools for linguistic inquiry. Ultimately, the locus of contact is not to be found in the interaction of such abstractions, but rather in the individual minds of those who live in contact communities. The present paper highlights these issues through a discussion of Spanish dialectal contact in the U.S., with a special emphasis on the variable social salience of regionally differentiated features. Work reviewed here is consistent with previous research that finds the relative salience of features to be a key determinant of their trajectory in situations of contact. Change in the use of high salience features is likely to be the result of direct accommodation between speakers, while change in low salience features is likely to arise by other, indirect mechanisms. The role of salience in shaping the outcomes of contact reinforces its inherently social nature, reminding us that what we hope to understand are not the results of dialects in contact, but rather, those of people in contact.},

Hunter-gatherer languages in particular have played a prominent role in the development of theories of language change in addition to the comparative method and family trees, but for the wrong reasons, since the comparative method is powerful for diagnosing relationships even in the case of heavy borrowing where tree models are not useful.

With this end in mind, we suggest some brief, quantitative indices that might be appropriate and useful for documenting social psychological variables for contemporary and future purposes. The first construct considered is ethnolinguistic vitality, which refers to those characteristics that make a language group likely to behave as an active collective entity in language contact situations. The second is language attitudes, which refer to the feelings and beliefs that people hold with regard to their own and others' languages and the associated language community/ies. The third is ethnolinguistic identity, which refers to the manner and extent to which individuals define themselves as members of an ethnolinguistic group. Although we maintain that more extensive, detailed coding should be included in sociolinguistic archives, we suggest that these three sets of indices should be minimally included in a battery to assess a speaker's ethnolinguistic orientation.},

While many such communities shift to the majority language in the space of a few generations, language maintenance is remarkably successful in this community. This is partially because of continuing immigration, but it is also typical of a transnational identity that characterizes many bilingual communities in modern Europe. The linguistic effects of this on-going contact situation include extensive codeswitching and slowly emerging changes in the lexicon and syntax. These are contained in a range of speech styles that show that in such modern migrant communities, the way in which different subgroups utilize their multilingual repertoire varies considerably, depending on background factors such as gender, locality, age, and socio-political identity.},

	abstract = {A speaker produced schwa-CV disyllables in which consonants were low or high in coarticulation resistance. Articulatory and acoustic measurements verified that the magnitude, but not the extent, of anticipatory coarticulation from the stressed vowel to the schwa was modulated by coarticulation resistance. In a perception experiment, listeners heard schwa-CV disyllables that ended in stressed /i/ or /a/ and made speeded identifications of the stressed vowels. Some disyllables had been cross-spliced so that a schwa vowel that had originally been produced in the context of C/i/ was spliced onto a C/a/ syllable or vice versa. Other disyllables were spliced so that a schwa originally from a C/i/ (or C/a/) context was spliced onto a different C/i/ (C/a/) token. Listeners’ response latencies were slower to cross spliced than to spliced disyllables but only in the context of low rather than high resistant consonants. The outcome is generally consistent with a hypothesis that listeners to speech “parse” the acoustic signal along coarticulatory or phonetic gestural lines and that success in parsing varies with the amount of acoustic evidence talkers provide. However, findings did not suggest “perfect” parsing. Correlations between the amount of acoustic information provided by the speaker and the extent to which listeners were disrupted by cross splicing were nonsignificant.},

Explanations for phonetic reduction of predictable forms tend to take one of two approaches: Intelligibility-based accounts hold that talkers maximize intelligibility of words that might otherwise be difficult to recognize; production-based accounts hold that variation reflects the speed of lexical access and retrieval in the language production system. Here we examine phonetic variation as a function of phonological neighborhood density, capitalizing on the fact that words from dense phonological neighborhoods tend to be relatively difficult to recognize, yet easy to produce. We show that words with many phonological neighbors tend to be phonetically reduced (shortened in duration and produced with more centralized vowels) in connected speech, when other predictors of phonetic variation are brought under statistical control. We argue that our findings are consistent with the predictions of production-based accounts of pronunciation variation.},

Instead, another mechanism might explain these results. Recent studies found that when a request was preceded by engaging a participant in dialogue (defined as a short conversation), the participant was more willing to fulfill the request. Thus, verbal mimicry might be perceived in the same way as dialogue. If this is the case, a theoretical confound would be revealed. To test whether the mechanisms are different of the same, two field studies were conducted using a 2 (dialogue: yes/no) × 2 (mimicry: yes/no) design. The study results revealed two main effects and no interaction effects, which means that verbal mimicry and dialogue are two distinct mechanisms. Interestingly, additive effects for these mechanisms were found.},

Prosodic dialect variation was analyzed in two domains: speaking rate and the phonetic expression of pitch movements associated with accented and phrase-final syllables. The results revealed significant effects of regional dialect on the distributions of pauses, pitch accents, and phrasal-boundary tone combinations. Significant effects of talker gender were also observed on the distributions of pitch accents and phrasal-boundary tone combinations. The findings from this study demonstrate that regional and gender identity features are encoded in part through prosody, and provide further motivation for the close examination of prosodic patterns across regional and social varieties of American English.},

The study further examines whether regional dialects form different groupings based on their segmental vs. global temporal characteristics. Acoustic measures included articulation rate, pause frequency and duration, and vowel and consonant duration variability. The results revealed that Southern American English is characterized by a slow overall articulation rate, long pauses, and highly variable syllable-to-syllable vowel durations, whereas the New England dialect is characterized by a fast overall articulation rate, short pauses, and highly variable syllable-to-syllable consonant durations. The patterns for the other dialects are more mixed: the Northern and Western dialects are characterized by low variability vowel durations, the Midland dialect shares a slow articulation rate with the Southern dialect, and the Mid-Atlantic dialect exhibits no unique temporal properties among those examined. Thus, temporal variation in regional dialects of American English is orthogonal to vowel variation, in which New England, Midland, and Western dialects are often characterized together as “General American”. Taken together, the results are consistent with the stereotype that Southerners talk slowly and Northerners talk quickly and suggest that pausing and segmental duration variability may contribute to the perceived speaking rate differences.},

The articulation rate is measured both in terms of the intended phones, i.e., phones present in the assumed canonical form, and as the number of actual, realized phones per second. The combination of these measures reflects the deletion of phones, which is related to speaking style. The effect of the two rate measures on the perceived speech rate is compared in two listening experiments on the basis of a set of intonation phrases with carefully balanced intended and realized phone rates, selected from a German database of spontaneous speech. Because the balance between input-oriented (effort) and output-oriented (communicative) constraints may be different at fast versus slow speech rates, the effect of articulation rate is compared both for fast and for slow phrases from the database. The effect of the listeners’ own speaking habits is also investigated to evaluate if listeners’ perception is based on a projection of their own behavior as a speaker. It is shown that listener judgments reflect both the intended and realized phone rates, and that their judgments are independent of the constraint balance and their own speaking habits.},

	abstract = {Talkers׳ regions of origin and native languages will significantly shape their speech production patterns. Previous results suggest that listeners are highly sensitive to whether a talker is a native or nonnative speaker of the language. Listeners also have some ability to categorize or classify talkers by regional dialect or nonnative accent. However, most previous studies have included variability in only one of these categories (many nonnative accents or many regional dialects). The present study simultaneously examined listeners’ perceptual organization of regional dialects and nonnative accents. Talkers representing six United States regional dialects, six international native dialects, and twelve nonnative accents were included in two tasks: an auditory free classification task—in which listeners grouped talkers based on perceived region of origin—and ladder task—in which listeners arranged talkers based on their perceived distance from standard American English. Listeners were sensitive to the distinction between native and nonnative accents, even when presented with a very wide range of dialects and accents. Further, subgroups within the native and nonnative clusters in the free classification task suggested several organizing factors, including perceived distance from the local standard, specific acoustic-phonetic talker characteristics, and speaking rate.},

The present study attempts to extend understanding of non-linguists’ perceptions of linguistic diversity through the investigation of how accurately and consistently UK-born students, resident in the north-east of England, can identify the speaker place of origin of six forms of L1 and L2 English. The results demonstrate that whilst the process of encoding indexical properties to and categorisations of speech stimulus as belonging to a specific language variety is complex, there is a clear tendency amongst informants to initially identify the speech as either native or non-native, most especially through the perception of specific segmental and non-segmental phonological features, before attempting more fine-grained classifications. The findings also point to the recognition of speaker place of origin at different levels of awareness, above and below the level of individual consciousness.},

	abstract = {This study used a multi-talker database containing intelligibility scores for 2000 sentences (20 talkers, 100 sentences), to identify talker-related correlates of speech intelligibility. We first investigated “global” talker characteristics (e.g., gender, F0 and speaking rate). Findings showed female talkers to be more intelligible as a group than male talkers. Additionally, we found a tendency for F0 range to correlate positively with higher speech intelligibility scores. However, F0 mean and speaking rate did not correlate with intelligibility. We then examined several fine-grained acoustic-phonetic talker-characteristics as correlates of overall intelligibility. We found that talkers with larger vowel spaces were generally more intelligible than talkers with reduced spaces. In investigating two cases of consistent listener errors (segment deletion and syllable affiliation), we found that these perceptual errors could be traced directly to detailed timing characteristics in the speech signal. Results suggest that a substantial portion of variability in normal speech intelligibility is traceable to specific acoustic-phonetic characteristics of the talker. Knowledge about these factors may be valuable for improving speech synthesis and recognition strategies, and for special populations (e.g., the hearing-impaired and second-language learners) who are particularly sensitive to intelligibility differences among talkers.
Auf der Grundlage eines Multi-Sprecher Datenkorpus mit den Verständlichkeitsbewertungen von 2000 Sätzen (20 Sprecher, 100 Sätze) wurden in dieser Studie die sprecherspezifischen Korrelate der Sprach Verständlichkeit untersucht. Zunächst wurden “globale” Sprechercharakteristika untersucht (z.B. Geschlecht, F0 und Sprechgeschwindigkeit). Die Resultate zeigen an, daβ weibliche Sprecher als Gesamtgruppe besser verstanden werden als männliche. Weiterhin wurde als Tendenz ermittelt, daβ die F0-Variationsbreite positiv mit erhöhten Verständlichkeitswerten korreliert. Allerdings korreliert die Sprachverständlichkeit nicht mit dem F0-Mittelwert oder der Sprechgeschwindigkeit. Anschlieβend wurden verschiedene detailphonetische akustische Sprechercharakteristika als Korrelate der Sprachverständlichkeit untersucht. Es wurde fest-gestellt, daβ Sprecher mit erweitertem Vokalraum im allgemeinen besser verstanden werden als Sprecher mit reduziertem Vokalraum. Unter genauerer Betrachtung zweier Fälle konsistenter Wahrnehmungsfehler (Tilgung und Silbenzuordnung von Segmenten) konnte festgestellt werden, daβ sich die Wahrnehmungsfehler direkt auf detaillierte Ausprägungen des Timing im Sprachsignal zurückführen lassen. Die Resultate weisen darauf hin, daβ sich ein Groβteil der Variabilität in der Sprachverständlichkeit auf akustisch-phonetische Charakteristika der jeweiligen Sprecher zurückführen lassen. Eine genaue Erkenntnis dieser Faktoren ist von Nutzen für Verfahren der Sprachsynthese und Spracherkenung, sowie für solche Populationen (z.B. bei Hörbehinderungen oder im Zweitspracherwerb), die besonders sensibel auf Unterschiede in der Verständlichkeit verschiedener Sprecher reagieren.
Dans cette étude, on a utilisé une base de données multi-locuteurs contenant des scores d'intelligibilité de 2000 phrases (20 locuteurs, 100 phrases) pour identifier les corrélats de l'intelligibilité qui sont dépendants du locuteur. Nous avons d'abord étudié des caractéristiques “globales” des locuteurs (genre, F0 et vitesse d'élocution). Il est apparu que les locutrices sont globalement plus intelligibles que les locuteurs. Nous avons également observé que l'ampleur du registre de F0 avait tendance à être corrélée positivement avec des scores d'intelligibilité plus élevés. Toutefois, la valeur moyenne de F0 et la vitesse d'élocution ne semblent pas être corrélées avec l'intelligibilité. Nous avons ensuite examiné d'autres corrélats de l'intelligibilité globale, plus fins au niveau des caractéristiques acoustico-phonétiques du locuteur. Nous avons observé que les locuteurs présentant des triangles vocaliques larges étaient généralement plus intelligibles que les locuteurs présentant des triangles vocaliques serrés. En étudiant deux cas d'erreurs d'écoute consistantes (destruction d'un segment et attribution à une syllabe), nous avons trouvé que ces erreurs perceptives pouvaient être dérivées directement des caractéristiques de timing détaillées du signal de parole. Les résultats suggèrent qu'une part substantielle de la variabilité de l'intelligibilité de la parole normale est attribuable aux caractéristiques acoustico-phonétiques spécifiques du locuteur. La connaissance de ces facteurs peut être utile pour améliorer la synthèse de la parole et les stratégies de reconnaissance, et pour des populations spécifiques (comme par exemple, les mal-entendants ou ceux qui apprennent une langue étrangère) qui sont particulièrement sensibles aux écarts d'intelligilibité entre locuteurs.},

Local, R. Ogden \& R. Temple (Eds.), Papers in laboratory phonology, Vol. VI (pp. 26–50)) reported that vowel dispersion, i.e. distance from the center of the talker's F1/F2 space, was greater in words that represented difficult recognition targets (‘hard’ words) than in easy recognition targets (‘easy’ words). The goal of the current study was to test whether that effect persisted when controlling for known other determinants of F1 and F2. A second goal was to test whether the pattern observed in the recordings analysed in Wright (2004) extended to all monophthongs in the set of recordings of which the words analysed in Wright (2004) formed a subset. We find that the dispersion difference between ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ words vowel dispersion is expected, given previous observations about effects of phonetic environment on vowel formants. When segmental context is taken into account, recognition difficulty fails to be predictive of vowel dispersion, both in the subset and in the larger database. An analysis of the fitted values of models of F1 and F2 based on consonantal factors (but not recognition difficulty) shows that the formant values predicted by those models separate vowels in “easy” and “hard” words in the manner observed in W2004. We discuss the implications for the effect of phonological neighbourhood density on language production, and for the relationship between lexical retrieval, auditory recognition difficulty and pronunciation variation.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem for understanding the evolution of human language has been the lack of significant parallels among nonhuman primates. Most researchers have focused on vocal plasticity—that is, the ability to learn novel sounds or modify call structure in response to social or environmental variables. Although songbirds, whales, dolphins, and some other mammals have this ability, nonhuman primates have appeared not to have it (1). Other studies found that nonhuman primates do not have a vocal tract that would allow them to produce the sounds of human speech (2) and that primates cannot take turns, a critical aspect of human conversation (3). All three points have been challenged by recent research (see the table), suggesting that nonhuman primates may after all be valuable models for understanding the evolution of speech and language.

	abstract = {Trying to uncover the roots of human speech and language has been the premier motivation to study the signalling behaviour of nonhuman primates for several decades. Focussing on the question of whether we find evidence for linguistic reference in the production of nonhuman primate vocalizations, I will first discuss how the criteria used to diagnose referential signalling have changed over time, and will then turn to the paradigmatic case of semantic communication in animals, the alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus. A recent in-depth analysis of the original material revealed that, while the alarm calls could be well distinguished, calls of similar structure were also used in within- and between-group aggression. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the idea that calls denote objects in the environment. Furthermore, nonhuman primates show only minimal signs of vocal production learning, one key prerequisite for conventionalized and symbolic communication. In addition, the structure of calls in different populations or closely related species is highly conserved. In conclusion, any continuity between nonhuman primate and human communication appears to be found at the level of the processing of signals. Why and how the ancestors of our own species one day began to talk to each other continues to be an enigma. Future research should focus on changes in the neural structure supporting volitional control over vocalizations, the gene networks associated with vocal production, and the developmental processes involved in the integration of production and perception of vocalizations.},

	abstract = {The linguistic diversity enduring beyond institutional pressures and social prejudices against nonstandard dialects questions the social forces influencing language maintenance across generations and how children contribute to this process. Children encounter multi-dialectal interactions in their early environment, and increasing evidence shows that the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation is not a side issue but an inherent part of the general acquisition process. Despite these recent advances in sociolinguistic acquisition, children’s sociolinguistic uses remain under-studied in relation to peer social networks and the ability to use dialect for identity purposes. Our study focused on a grammatical sociolinguistic variable consisting of the alternation between a regional and a standard variant of the third person object pronoun in French. The regional variant is a remnant of the Francoprovençal language and its usage by adults is strongly associated with local identity in the French Alps. We described, using questionnaires, the social networks of 117 10-11 year-old girls and boys living in the same restricted rural area. Thirteen native target children (7 girls and 6 boys) were selected from the sample, as well as 39 same-sex friends chosen according to their place of birth (native vs non-native) and the duration of their friendship with the targets (number of years they have known each other). The target children were recorded during spontaneous dyadic conversations during free play at school with each category of friends. Target boys, but not girls, used the regional variant significantly more frequently with their long-term native friends than with their non-native friends. This adjustment mirrored their partners’ uses. Moreover, with long-term native friends, boys used the regional variant twice as frequently as girls. Boys appeared thus as key actors in the maintenance and the diffusion of regional cues in local social networks.},

	abstract = {Research in speakers of closely related varieties has shown that bilectalism and non-standardization affect speakers’ perception of the variants that exist in their native languages in a way that is absent from the performance of their monolingual peers. One possible explanation for this difference is that non-standardization blurs the boundaries of grammatical variants and increases grammatical fluidity. Affected by such factors, bilectals become less accurate in identifying the variety to which a grammatical variant pertains. Another explanation is that their differential performance derives from the fact that they are competent in two varieties. Under this scenario, the difference is due to the existence of two linguistic systems in the course of development, and not to how close or standardized these systems are. This study employs a novel variety-judgment task in order to elucidate which of the two explanations holds. Having administered the task to monolinguals, bilectals, and bilinguals, including heritage language learners and L1 attriters, we obtained a dataset of 16,245 sentences. The analysis shows differential performance between bilectal and bilingual speakers, granting support for the first explanation. We discuss the role of factors such as non-standardization and linguistic proximity in language development and flesh out the implications of the results in relation to different developmental trajectories.},

	abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that unfamiliar languages sound faster than one’s native language. Empirical evidence for this impression has, so far, come from explicit rate judgments. The aim of the present study was to test whether such perceived rate differences between native and foreign languages have effects on implicit speech processing. Our measure of implicit rate perception was “normalization for speaking rate”: an ambiguous vowel between short /a/ and long /a:/ is interpreted as /a:/ following a fast but as /a/ following a slow carrier sentence. That is, listeners did not judge speech rate itself; instead, they categorized ambiguous vowels whose perception was implicitly affected by the rate of the context. We asked whether a bias towards long /a:/ might be observed when the context is not actually faster but simply spoken in a foreign language. A fully symmetrical experimental design was used: Dutch and German participants listened to rate matched (fast and slow) sentences in both languages spoken by the same bilingual speaker. Sentences were followed by nonwords that contained vowels from an /a-a:/ duration continuum. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 showed a consistent effect of rate normalization for both listener groups. Moreover, for German listeners, across the two experiments, foreign sentences triggered more /a:/ responses than (rate matched) native sentences, suggesting that foreign sentences were indeed perceived as faster. Moreover, this Foreign Language effect was modulated by participants’ ability to understand the foreign language: those participants that scored higher on a foreign language translation task showed less of a Foreign Language effect. However, opposite effects were found for the Dutch listeners. For them, their native rather than the foreign language induced more /a:/ responses. Nevertheless, this reversed effect could be reduced when additional spectral properties of the context were controlled for. Experiment 3, using explicit rate judgments, replicated the effect for German but not Dutch listeners. We therefore conclude that the subjective impression that foreign languages sound fast may have an effect on implicit speech processing, with implications for how language learners perceive spoken segments in a foreign language.},

	abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of between-talker differences in accent and dialect, little is known about how listeners adjust to this source of variability as language is perceived in real time. In three experiments, we examined whether, and when, listeners can use specific knowledge of a particular talker's accent during on-line speech processing. Listeners were exposed to the speech of two talkers, a male who had an unfamiliar regional dialect of American English, in which the /æ/ vowel is raised to /ei/ only before /g/ (e.g., bag is pronounced /beig/), and a female talker without the dialect. In order to examine how knowledge of a particular talker's accent influenced language processing, we examined listeners' interpretation of unaccented words such as back and bake in contexts that included a competitor like bag. If interpretation processes are talker-specific, the pattern of competition from bag should vary depending on how that talker pronounces the competitor word. In all three experiments, listeners rapidly used their knowledge of how the talker would have pronounced bag to either rule out or include bag as a temporary competitor. Providing a cue to talker identity prior to the critical word strengthened these effects. These results are consistent with views of language processing in which multiple sources of information, including previous experience with the current talker and contextual cues, are rapidly integrated during lexical activation and selection processes.},

The results suggest that the more similar the listener's dialect is to Utah English, the better his or her ability to identify Utah speakers. Moreover, it was found that listeners from Utah use less stereotypical characteristics of Utah English for identifying Utahns from non-Utahns; those from the Western United States and other locations use more. This study demonstrates that listeners with more experience with Utah English are better able to identify Utah speakers than those with less experience. These findings are also examined in light of stereotypical perceptions of both Utah English and the phonetic characteristics examined in this study.},

The experiment also explores the participants' self-assessment of their own competence in the localization task.

However, the listeners' error patterns in these tasks reveal systematic confusions between phonologically similar dialects. In the present study, a free classification procedure was used to measure the perceptual similarity structure of regional dialect variation in the United States. In two experiments, participants listened to a set of short English sentences produced by male talkers only (Experiment 1) and by male and female talkers (Experiment 2). The listeners were instructed to group the talkers by regional dialect into as many groups as they wanted with as many talkers in each group as they wished. Multidimensional scaling analyses of the data revealed three primary dimensions of perceptual similarity (linguistic markedness, geography, and gender). In addition, a comparison of the results obtained from the free classification task to previous results using the same stimulus materials in six-alternative forced-choice categorization tasks revealed that response biases in the six-alternative task were reduced or eliminated in the free classification task. Thus, the results obtained with the free classification task in the current study provided further evidence that the underlying structure of perceptual dialect category representations reflects important linguistic and sociolinguistic factors.},

We first discuss bottom-up processes in person construal based on visual features (e.g., facial prototypicality and bodily cues), and then discuss how top-down factors (e.g., beliefs, stereotypes) may influence these processes. Next, we examine how the initial categorization of targets as ingroup or outgroup members influences identification, stereotyping, and group-based evaluations, and the relations between these constructs. We also explore the implications of the activation of these constructs for a range of social judgments including emotion identification, empathy, and intergroup behaviors. Finally, we describe a variety of well established and more recent strategies to reduce intergroup bias that target the activation of category-based knowledge, including intergroup contact, approach orientations, evaluative conditioning, and perspective taking.},

	abstract = {Most recent studies on the geographical distribution of acoustic features analyze comparatively few speakers and localities, both of which may be unrepresentative of the diversity found in larger or more spatially fragmented populations. In the present study we introduce a new paradigm that enables the crowdsourcing of acoustic features through smartphone devices. We used Dialäkt Äpp, a free iOS app that allows users to record themselves, to crowdsource audio data. Nearly 3,000 speakers from 452 localities in German-speaking Switzerland provided recordings; we measured articulation rates for these speakers using a metric based on duration intervals between consecutive vowel onsets. Results revealed distinct regional differences in articulation rate between major dialect regions and individual localities. The specification of 452 localities enabled analyses at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Results further revealed a robust effect of gender, with women articulating significantly more slowly than men. Both the geographical patterns and the effect of gender found in this study corroborate similar findings on Swiss German previously reported in a very limited set of localities, thus verifying the validity of the crowdsourcing framework. Given the application of this new framework, a large bulk of the discussion is devoted to discussing methodological caveats.},

The second type we term top–down, and use it to refer to the way our cultural upbringing broadly shapes how we think, which may in turn have an impact on how we perceive the world. An important consideration regarding cultural influences is that many individuals grow up with exposure to environmental stimulations of more than one culture.

Despite the widespread influence of accents on social interactions, educational and work settings the neural underpinnings of this social bias toward our own accent and, what may drive this bias, are unexplored. We measured brain activity while participants from two different geographical backgrounds listened passively to 3 English accent types embedded in an adaptation design. Cerebral activity in several regions, including bilateral amygdalae, revealed a significant interaction between the participants' own accent and the accent they listened to: while repetition of own accents elicited an enhanced neural response, repetition of the other group's accent resulted in reduced responses classically associated with adaptation. Our findings suggest that increased social relevance of, or greater emotional sensitivity to in-group accents, may underlie the own-accent bias. Our results provide a neural marker for the bias associated with accents, and show, for the first time, that the neural response to speech is partly shaped by the geographical background of the listener.},

To support the processing of novel word forms as well as familiar word forms in novel contexts, an abstract level of representation is needed in which many phonetic details and contextual features are disregarded. At the same time, evidence has accumulated that such details are retained in memory and used in processing individual words and indexical features of language. Taken together, these results mean that a hybrid model of phonological representation is needed. The abstract level supports generalizations based on lexical type statistics and fast adaptation to communicative requirements through the reuse of existing categories. A richly detailed level of representation is implicated in word-specific phonetic patterns, the detailed dynamics of regular sound changes, and active associations of phonetic patterns with gender, age, and dialect.},

Second, it investigates the role which intonation plays in the identification of Norwegian dialects. In a number of listening experiments, 15 groups of young Norwegians from different parts of Norway were asked to identify 15 different dialects. The dialects were presented in the original form as well as in a version that was manipulated by computer in such a way that the intonation was removed. In this way it was possible to see how important intonation is for the identification of the dialects. The results are put into perspective by comparing them to results of similar experiments with Dutch dialects. Norwegians turned out to be less good at recognizing Norwegian dialects than Dutchmen. Linguistic and extra-linguistic explanations are given. Furthermore the results show that intonation is more important for the identification of Norwegian dialects than for the identification of Dutch dialects.},

Measures of pronunciation distance are used in several subfields of linguistics, including psycholinguistics, dialectology and typology. In contrast to the commonly used Levenshtein algorithm, NDL is grounded in cognitive theory of competitive reinforcement learning and is able to generate asymmetrical pronunciation distances. In a first study, we validated the NDL-based pronunciation distances by comparing them to a large set of native-likeness ratings given by native American English speakers when presented with accented English speech. In a second study, the NDL-based pronunciation distances were validated on the basis of perceptual dialect distances of Norwegian speakers. Results indicated that the NDL-based pronunciation distances matched perceptual distances reasonably well with correlations ranging between 0.7 and 0.8. While the correlations were comparable to those obtained using the Levenshtein distance, the NDL-based approach is more flexible as it is also able to incorporate acoustic information other than sound segments.},

These perceptions are investigated by the identification of authentic voice samples (rather than other instruments widely used in perceptual dialectology such as mental mapping): respondents from the Pays de la Loire region of north-western France heard extracts of scripted speech from Nancy and Rennes, and were asked to identify the speakers' regional background and say whether they were of urban or rural origin. The results of this test show that while some difference between the two speaker location groups was accurately perceived, the informants also formed some inaccurate judgements, partly based on social stereotypes. Overall there is some confirmation of accent levelling, and of general social psychological tendencies such as stereotyping, annexation and time-lag in perceptions of regional–social linguistic variation.},

In a first set of experiments, listeners were asked to identify the speakers’ country of origin: they achieved 60\% correct identification on average, with significant effects of listeners’ region of origin, speakers’ age, socioeconomic status, and region of origin. In a second set of experiments, listeners from Belgium, France, and Switzerland were asked to identify the speakers’ region of origin within each country (5-alternative forced choice). Results, albeit above chance, proved to be poorer than they were in the first set of experiments (31\% correct identification on average). Complementary analyses were conducted to evaluate the role of listeners’ region of origin, speakers’ age, speakers’ region of origin, and their interaction. They showed asymmetrical response patterns across the three countries under investigation: France (or, within France, Paris, which represents the norm) seems to act as a magnet and a catalyst of unification. Younger generations, especially, are more often associated with its way of speaking when their accent is not clearly identifiable. Switzerland, though, resists this homogenizing process better than Belgium does.},

Une expérience perceptive a été menée, d'où il ressort que les dimensions étudiées sont bien identifiées par les sujets. Pour les jeunes locuteurs comme pour les locuteurs plus âgés, en lecture comme en parole spontanée, les résultats sont très robustes. Ils sont de plus assez fidèles à la conscience linguistique auto-évaluée par les auditeurs: quand ceux-ci se déclaraient confiants pour reconnaître les accents en présence, tel a effectivement été le cas.

In the present study gait was studied in 47 healthy inhabitants of Tyrol living in rural or semi-urban (Innsbruck, Austria) settings and 43 healthy subjects residing in Berlin, Germany. In addition, gait was assessed in 23 patients in early stages of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (11 in Berlin, 12 in Innsbruck). Healthy subjects in Berlin showed faster gait velocity than their counterparts in Tyrol, and patients with Parkinson's disease were slightly slower than their respective healthy peers in both environments. Surprisingly, patients with Parkinson's disease from Berlin had significantly faster walking speeds than both patients and healthy control subjects from Tyrol. High gait tempo in parkinsonian patients from Berlin was characterized by fast step-rates and short strides. Differences in normal gait in different sociocultural settings are thus reflected in parkinsonian slowing of gait.},

	abstract = {Speakers constantly learn language from the environment by sampling their linguistic input and adjusting their representations accordingly. Logically, people should attend more to the environment and adjust their behavior in accordance with it more the lower their success in the environment is. We test whether the learning of linguistic input follows this general principle in two studies: a corpus analysis of a TV game show, Jeopardy, and a laboratory task modeled after Go Fish. We show that lower (non-linguistic) success in the task modulates learning of and reliance on linguistic patterns in the environment. In Study 1, we find that poorer performance increases conformity with linguistic norms, as reflected by increased preference for frequent grammatical structures. In Study 2, which consists of a more interactive setting, poorer performance increases learning from the immediate social environment, as reflected by greater repetition of others’ grammatical structures. We propose that these results have implications for models of language production and language learning and for the propagation of language change. In particular, they suggest that linguistic changes might spread more quickly in times of crisis, or when the gap between more and less successful people is larger. The results might also suggest that innovations stem from successful individuals while their propagation would depend on relatively less successful individuals. We provide a few historical examples that are in line with the first suggested implication, namely, that the spread of linguistic changes is accelerated during difficult times, such as war time and an economic downturn.},

If this is the case, people who interact with fewer others should be more susceptible to the influence of each of their interlocutors. This paper tests whether indeed people who interact with fewer other people have more malleable phonological representations. Using a perceptual learning paradigm, this paper shows that individuals who regularly interact with fewer others are more likely to change their boundary between /d/ and /t/ following exposure to an atypical speaker. It further shows that the effect of number of interlocutors is not due to differences in ability to learn the speaker’s speech patterns, but specific to likelihood of generalizing the learned pattern. These results have implications for both language learning and language change, as they suggest that individuals with smaller social networks might play an important role in propagating linguistic changes.},

title = "First steps towards a typological profile of creoles",
abstract = "In the past four decades, several scholars have proposed lists of typical creole features: e.g. Taylor (1971), Bickerton (1981), Markey (1982), McWhorter (1998), Holm and Patrick (2007). However, when these were tested against individual creoles or sets of creoles, the results were, at best, mixed: there are no creoles that adhere to all the features selected by these authors, and worse yet, quite a few of the proposed features are only found in a minority of creoles. Nevertheless, the studies by Parkvall (2008) and Bakker et al. (2011) clearly point in the direction of a specific typological profile for creoles: creoles are overall less complex than non-creoles (Parkvall 2008), and selections of different sets of structural properties all suggest distinctive properties of creoles (Bakker et al. 2011). These authors, however, have not been able to pinpoint the individual features that distinguish creoles from non-creoles.In this paper, we continue along the lines laid down by Parkvall (2008) and Bakker et al. (2011). We will show that three structural features are sufficient to distinguish 18 creoles reliably and unequivocally from a sample of hundreds of non-creole languages worldwide.",

	abstract = {This study addresses the hypothesis that the more accurately a speaker discriminates a vowelcontrast, the more distinctly the speaker produces that contrast.Measures of speech production and perception were collected from 19 young adult speakers of American English. In the production experiment, speakers repeated the words cod, cud, who’d, and hood in a carrier phrase at normal, clear, and fast rates. Articulatory movements and the associated acoustic signal were recorded, yielding measures of contrast distance between /ɑ/ and /ʌ/ and between /u/ and /ʊ/. In the discrimination experiment, sets of seven natural-sounding stimuli ranging from cod to cud and who’d to hood were synthesized, based on productions by one male and one female speaker. The continua were then presented to each of the 19 speakers in labeling and discrimination tasks. Consistent with the hypothesis, speakers with discrimination scores above the median produced greater acoustic contrasts than speakers with discrimination scores at or below the median. Such a relation between speech production and perception is compatible with a model of speech production in which articulatory movements for vowels are planned primarily in auditory space.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to test whether both phonetic and phonological representations of intonation can be rapidly modified when imitating utterances belonging to a different regional variety of the same language. Our main hypothesis was that tonal alignment, just as other phonetic features of speech, would be rapidly modified by Italian speakers when imitating pitch accents of a different (Southern) variety of Italian. In particular, we tested whether Bari Italian (BI) speakers would produce later peaks for their native rising L + H* (question pitch accent) in the process of imitating Neapolitan Italian (NI) rising L* + H accents. Also, we tested whether BI speakers are able to modify other phonetic properties (pitch level) as well as phonological characteristics (changes in tonal composition) of the same contour. In a follow-up study, we tested if the reverse was also true, i.e., whether NI speakers would produce earlier peaks within the L* + H accent in the process of imitating the L + H* of BI questions, despite the presence of a contrast between two rising accents in this variety. Our results show that phonetic detail of tonal alignment can be successfully modified by both BI and NI speakers when imitating a model speaker of the other variety. The hypothesis of a selective imitation process preventing alignment modifications in NI was hence not supported. Moreover the effect was significantly stronger for low frequency words. Participants were also able to imitate other phonetic cues, in that they modified global utterance pitch level. Concerning phonological convergence, speakers modified the tonal specification of the edge tones in order to resemble that of the other variety by either suppressing or increasing the presence of a final H\%. Hence, our data show that intonation imitation leads to fast modification of both phonetic and phonological intonation representations including detail of tonal alignment and pitch scaling.},

However, one often neglected aspect is that signal exchange in every modality is constrained by noise, be it in the transmission channel or in the nervous system. This book analyses whether and how animals can cope with such constraints, and explores the implications that noise has for our understanding of animal communication. It is written by leading biologists working on different taxa including insects, fish, amphibians, lizards, birds, and mammals. In addition to this broad taxonomic approach, the chapters also cover a wide array of research disciplines: from the mechanisms of signal production and perception, to the behavioural ecology of signalling, the evolution of animal communication, and conservation issues. This volume promotes the integration of the knowledge gained by the diverse approaches to the study of animal communication and, at the same time, highlights particularly interesting fields of current and future research.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The Lombard effect describes the tendency for speakers to increase pitch, intensity, and duration in the presence of noise. It is unclear whether these modifications are uniformly applied across all words within an utterance or whether information-bearing content words are further enhanced compared with function words. In the present study, the authors investigated the influence of linguistic content on acoustic modifications made to speech in noise.
METHOD: Sixteen speaker-listener pairs engaged in an interactive cooperative game in quiet, 60 dB of multitalker noise, and 90 dB of multitalker noise. Speaker productions were analyzed to examine differences in fundamental frequency (F(0)), intensity, and duration of target words in sentences across noise conditions.
RESULTS: Proportional increases in F(0,) intensity, and duration were noted for all word types as noise increased from quiet to 60 dB. From quiet to 90 dB, content words that referred to agents, objects, and locations were disproportionately elongated compared with function words. Additionally, agents were further enhanced by increased F(0).
CONCLUSIONS: At moderate noise levels, most word types appear to be uniformly boosted in F(0), intensity, and duration. As noise increases, linguistic content shapes the extent of the Lombard effect, with F(0) and duration serving as primary cues for marking information-bearing word types.},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical models have demonstrated that phenotypic traits can support the non-random assortment of cooperators in a population, thereby permitting the evolution of cooperation. In these “tag-based models”, cooperators modulate cooperation according to an observable and hard-to-fake trait displayed by potential interaction partners. Socially acquired vocalizations in general, and speech accent among humans in particular, are frequently proposed as hard to fake and hard to hide traits that display sufficient cross-populational variability to reliably guide such social assortment in fission–fusion societies. Adults’ sensitivity to accent variation in social evaluation and decisions about cooperation is well-established in sociolinguistic research. The evolutionary and developmental origins of these biases are largely unknown, however. Here, we investigate the influence of speech accent on 5–10-year-old children's developing social and cooperative preferences across four Brazilian Amazonian towns. Two sites have a single dominant accent, and two sites have multiple co-existing accent varieties. We found that children's friendship and resource allocation preferences were guided by accent only in sites characterized by accent heterogeneity. Results further suggest that this may be due to a more sensitively tuned ear for accent variation. The demonstrated local-accent preference did not hold in the face of personal cost. Results suggest that mechanisms guiding tag-based assortment are likely tuned according to locally relevant tag-variation.},

According to this account, a tendency to favour similar others (homophily) has been a key driving force in creating unique human forms of culture and thus evoked the striking differences we observe between human groups. We begin by presenting evidence that, from the early stages of development, humans have shown a strong tendency to interact with, and learn from, individuals who are similar to themselves. Following this, we propose that the homophilic preferences of the group in general has created a feedback loop that ensures that children engage in high-fidelity copying of the group’s behavioural repertoire. This allows children to reap the benefits of others’ homophilic preferences and to therefore maintain their position within the group. In consequence, homophilic preferences have transformed a number of mechanisms that we share with other species, for example emulation and majority-biased transmission, into human unique variants such as social imitation and conformity. Homophilic preferences have furthermore spawned a new tendency to interpret the structure of actions as social signals: norm-psychology. The homophily account thus connects previously disparate findings in comparative, developmental, and social psychology and provides a unified account of the importance of the preference for similar others in species-specific human social behaviour.},

These errors were hypothesized to originate from self-organizing mechanisms underlying context-free gestural coordination. The current study investigates whether such self-organizing mechanisms and resulting speech errors are influenced by coproduction constraints, which are introduced by phonetic context. Speakers repeated CVC–CVC word pairs, differing in onsets and sharing their rhymes. “Phonetic context” was manipulated by changing the rhyme across different word pairs using specific vowel- and consonant-combinations. Vertical movements of tongue tip, tongue dorsum, and lower lip were recorded with Electro-Magnetic Articulography. The results revealed that the tongue dorsum as an intruding articulator showed more intrusions in front vowel context than in low back vowel context. In addition, this articulator showed more intrusions than the tongue tip in /æ/ context, and more intrusions than the lower lip in /ɪ/ context. Reductions did not demonstrate this effect of vowel context. However, both tongue dorsum and tongue tip reduced more than the lower lip. The findings are explained in terms of the amount of spatial overlap of gestures and intruding articulatory movements, as defined in Articulatory Phonology.},

This confirms earlier proposals in the literature that code-switching in bilingual children decreases when they gain proficiency in their dominant language, especially in vocabulary. Contradicting expectations from other studies, our corpus data also reveal that for adults, multi-word insertions of Nepali into Chintang are just as likely to undergo full syntactic integration as single-word insertions. Speakers of younger generations show less syntactic integration. We propose that this reflects a change between generations, from strongly asymmetrical, Chintang-dominated bilingualism in older generations to more balanced bilingualism where Chintang and Nepali operate as clearly separate systems in younger generations. This change is likely to have been triggered by the increase of Nepali presence over the past few decades.},

Evolutionists have proposed a number of explanations for this pattern, including cultural group selection and extensions of more general processes such as reciprocity, kin selection, and multi-level selection acting on genes. Evolutionary processes are consilient; they affect several different empirical domains, such as patterns of behavior and the proximal drivers of that behavior. In this target article, we sketch the evidence from five domains that bear on the explanatory adequacy of cultural group selection and competing hypotheses to explain human cooperation. Does cultural transmission constitute an inheritance system that can evolve in a Darwinian fashion? Are the norms that underpin institutions among the cultural traits so transmitted? Do we observe sufficient variation at the level of groups of considerable size for group selection to be a plausible process? Do human groups compete, and do success and failure in competition depend upon cultural variation? Do we observe adaptations for cooperation in humans that most plausibly arose by cultural group selection? If the answer to one of these questions is “no,” then we must look to other hypotheses. We present evidence, including quantitative evidence, that the answer to all of the questions is “yes” and argue that we must take the cultural group selection hypothesis seriously. If culturally transmitted systems of rules (institutions) that limit individual deviance organize cooperation in human societies, then it is not clear that any extant alternative to cultural group selection can be a complete explanation.},

	abstract = {Participants took part in two speech tests. In both tests, a model speaker produced vowel–consonant–vowels (VCVs) in which the initial vowel varied unpredictably in duration. In the simple response task, participants shadowed the initial vowel; when the model shifted to production of any of three CVs (/pa/, /ta/ or /ka/), participants produced a CV that they were assigned to say (one of /pa/, /ta/ or /ka/). In the choice task, participants shadowed the initial vowel; when the model shifted to a CV, participants shadowed that too. We found that, measured from the model’s onset of closure for the consonant to the participant’s closure onset, response times in the choice task exceeded those in the simple task by just 26 ms. This is much shorter than the canonical difference between simple and choice latencies [100–150 ms according to ] and is near the fastest simple times that Luce reports. The findings imply rapid access to articulatory speech information in the choice task. A second experiment found much longer choice times when the perception–production link for speech could not be exploited. A third experiment and an acoustic analysis verified that our measurement from closure in Experiment 1 provided a valid marker of speakers’ onsets of consonant production. A final experiment showed that shadowing responses are imitations of the model’s speech. We interpret the findings as evidence that listeners rapidly extract information about speakers’ articulatory gestures.},

According to the revised theory, phonetic information is perceived in a biologically distinct system, a ‘module’ specialized to detect the intended gestures of the speaker that are the basis for phonetic categories. Built into the structure of this module is the unique but lawful relationship between the gestures and the acoustic patterns in which they are variously overlapped. In consequence, the module causes perception of phonetic structure without translation from preliminary auditory impressions. Thus, it is comparable to such other modules as the one that enables an animal to localize sound. Peculiar to the phonetic module are the relation between perception and production it incorporates and the fact that it must compete with other modules for the same stimulus variations.},

Calls were recorded from 16 individuals in Rocamadour and 23 individuals in Salem. Despite an overall similarity, an acoustic analysis revealed significant differences in the call structure between populations. To test the perceptual salience of these acoustic differences, we conducted playback experiments in both populations in which calls from the own or the other population were broadcast. The overall response pattern did not differ significantly between the populations with regard to the origin of the call. However, subjects responded slightly, but significantly longer after playback of calls from the other group. Although call function apparently determined the general response of subjects, they none the less discriminated between calls from different origins. These results suggest a small but possibly meaningful plasticity in call production.},

Swiss dialects rarely appeared in written form before the 1980s, apart from the genre of dialect literature. Due to the growing acceptance of informal writing styles in many European languages, dialect is increasingly employed for written personal communication, in particular in computer-mediated communication (CMC). In Swiss Internet Relay Chat (IRC) rooms, varieties of German are used side by side as all chatters have a command of both standard and dialectal varieties. Depending on the channel, the proportion of dialectal contributions can be as high as 90 percent. The choice of a particular variety depends on both individual preference and on the predominant variety used within a specific thread. In this paper I take a quantitative approach to language variation in IRC and demonstrate how such an approach can help embed qualitative research on code-switching in CMC.},

This paper analyses how New Zealanders produce these vowels when in an Australian-primed context. Two studies are undertaken. The first – a corpus analysis – looks at the realization of these vowels in New Zealanders' spontaneous talk about Australia. The second – an experiment – looks at the realization of these vowels in a word reading task, following the production of Australia-related lexical items. Both the experiment and the corpus analysis show differences in participant productions across Australia and non-Australia contexts. The corpus analysis shows a significant effect on the realization of the KIT and TRAP vowels, with Australian contexts associated with more Australian realizations. Both the corpus and the experiment reveal a significant interaction between speaker experience and context for DRESS. Only speakers who have ample previous experience with Australian English produce more Australian variants in an Australian context. These results highlight how different methodological approaches can provide different angles on the same question. Together, they show that subtle topic-based variation in speech production can occur. They also indicate that individual speakers' experience and beliefs can also play an important mediating role.},

	abstract = {The study of sound change in progress in Philadelphia has been facilitated by the application of forced alignment and automatic vowel measurement to a large corpus of neighborhood studies, including 379 speakers with dates of birth from 1888 to 1991. Two of the sound changes active in the 1970s show a linear pattern of incrementation in succeeding decades. The fronting of back upgliding vowels /aw/ and /ow/ shows a reversal in the direction of change, beginning with those born after 1940. The study also finds a general withdrawal from two salient features of local phonology, tense /æh/ and /oh/, led by those with higher education. Younger speakers with higher education have also reorganized the traditional Philadelphia tense/lax split of short-a to form a nasal system with tensing before all and only nasal consonants. The development of the Philadelphia vowel system can be understood in the geographic context of neighboring dialects. Features in common with North and North Midland dialects have accelerated in use while features in common with South Midland and Southern dialects have been reversed in favor of Northern patterns. The microevolution of a linguistic system can be seen here as subject to phonological generalizations but driven by social evaluation as features rise in level of salience for members of the speech community.*},

It demonstrates how, by digitally manipulating the speech of isolated individuals, it is possible to obtain reliable evidence that pitch range and sibilant duration may act as indexical of a gay male identity. Further scrutiny of this result, however, illustrates that linguistic indexicality is not as straightforward as it originally appears. Subsequent analyses of the data highlight the ways in which the perceptual evaluation of sexuality is a highly contingent process, dependent upon a variety of sociolinguistic factors. An envelope of variation in listeners' affective judgments of a speaker is shown to exist, and it is argued that research on the perception of identity must go beyond identification of salient features, and also consider when and why these features are not salient.},

We consider how these mechanisms might be implicated in human–computer interaction (HCI), and then review recent empirical studies that investigated linguistic alignment in HCI. We argue that there is strong evidence that alignment occurs in HCI, but that it differs in important ways from that found in interactions between humans: It is generally stronger and has a larger mediated component that is concerned with enhancing communicative success.},

Until now, experimental studies of co-ordination have concentrated on the development of shared strategies for reference. We present an experiment that employed a novel confederate-scripting technique to investigate whether speakers also co-ordinate syntactic structure in dialogue. Pairs of speakers took it in turns to describe pictures to each other. One speaker was a confederate of the experimenter and produced scripted descriptions that systematically varied in syntactic structure. The syntactic structure of the confederate's description affected the syntactic structure of the other speaker's subsequent description. We suggest that these effects are instances of syntactic priming (Bock, 1986), and provide evidence for a shared level of representation in comprehension and production. We describe how these effects might be realized in a processing model of language production, and relate them to previous findings of linguistic co-ordination in dialogue.},

	doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01163},
	abstract = {One way of evaluating the salience of a linguistic feature is by assessing the extent to which listeners associate the feature with a social category such as a particular socioeconomic class, gender, or nationality. Such ‘top–down’ associations will inevitably differ somewhat from listener to listener, as a linguistic feature – the pronunciation of a vowel or consonant, for instance – can evoke multiple social category associations, depending upon the dialect in which the feature is embedded and the context in which it is heard. In a given speech community it is reasonable to expect, as a consequence of the salience of the linguistic form in question, a certain level of intersubjective agreement on social category associations. Two metrics we can use to quantify the salience of a linguistic feature are (a) the speed with which the association is made, and (b) the degree to which members of a speech community appear to share the association. Through the use of a new technique, designed as an adaptation of the Implicit Association Test, this paper examines levels of agreement among 40 informants from the Scottish/English border region with respect to the associations they make between four key phonetic variables and the social categories of ‘Scotland’ and ‘England.’ Our findings reveal that the participants exhibit differential agreement patterns across the set of phonetic variables, and that listeners’ responses vary in line with whether participants are members of the Scottish or the English listener groups. These results demonstrate the importance of community-level agreement with respect to the associations that listeners make between social categories and linguistic forms, and as a means of ranking the forms’ relative salience.},

	abstract = {Over the years, vocal matching has progressed beyond being an interesting behavioural phenomenon to one that now has relevance to a wide range of fields. In this review, we use birds and cetaceans to explain what vocal matching is, why animals vocally match and how vocal matching can be identified. We show that while the functional aspects of vocal matching are similar, the contexts in which matching is used can differ between taxa. Whereas vocal matching in songbirds facilitates mate attraction and the immediate defence of resources, in parrots and cetaceans it plays a role in the maintenance of social bonds and the promotion of behavioural synchrony. We propose criteria for defining vocal matching with the aim of stimulating more matching studies across a wider range of taxa, including those using other, non-vocal, communication modalities. Finally, we encourage future studies to explore the importance of vocal learning in the development of vocal matching, and the information it may provide to third parties in the communication network.},

	abstract = {The laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) is essential for the production of learned vocal behaviors because bilateral damage to this area renders humans unable to speak but has no apparent effect on innate vocalizations such as human laughing and crying or monkey calls. Several hypotheses have been put forward attempting to explain the evolutionary changes from monkeys to humans that potentially led to enhanced LMC functionality for finer motor control of speech production. These views, however, remain limited to the position of the larynx area within the motor cortex, as well as its connections with the phonatory brainstem regions responsible for the direct control of laryngeal muscles. Using probabilistic diffusion tractography in healthy humans and rhesus monkeys, we show that, whereas the LMC structural network is largely comparable in both species, the LMC establishes nearly 7-fold stronger connectivity with the somatosensory and inferior parietal cortices in humans than in macaques. These findings suggest that important “hard-wired” components of the human LMC network controlling the laryngeal component of speech motor output evolved from an already existing, similar network in nonhuman primates. However, the evolution of enhanced LMC–parietal connections likely allowed for more complex synchrony of higher-order sensorimotor coordination, proprioceptive and tactile feedback, and modulation of learned voice for speech production.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The role of the primary motor cortex in the formation of a comprehensive network controlling speech and language has been long underestimated and poorly studied. Here, we provide comparative and quantitative evidence for the significance of this region in the control of a highly learned and uniquely human behavior: speech production. From the viewpoint of structural network organization, we discuss potential evolutionary advances of enhanced temporoparietal cortical connections with the laryngeal motor cortex in humans compared with nonhuman primates that may have contributed to the development of finer vocal motor control necessary for speech production.},

	isbn = {978-3-319-27719-6},
	abstract = {Vocal learning is usually studied in songbirds and humans, species that can form auditory templates by listening to acoustic models and then learn to vocalize to match the template. Most other species are thought to develop vocalizations without auditory feedback. However, auditory input influences the acoustic structure of vocalizations in a broad distribution of birds and mammals. Vocalizations are dened here as sounds generated by forcing air past vibrating membranes. A vocal motor program may generate vocalizations such as crying or laughter, but auditory feedback may be required for matching precise acoustic features of vocalizations. This chapter discriminates limited vocal learning, which uses auditory input to fine-tune acoustic features of an inherited auditory template, from complex vocal learning, in which novel sounds are learned by matching a learned auditory template. Two or three songbird taxa and four or ve mammalian taxa are known for complex vocal learning. A broader range of mammals converge in the acoustic structure of vocalizations when in socially interacting groups, which qualifies as limited vocal learning. All birds and mammals tested use auditory-vocal feedback to adjust their vocalizations to compensate for the effects of noise, and many species modulate their signals as the costs and benefits of communicating vary. This chapter asks whether some auditory-vocal feedback may have provided neural substrates for the evolution of vocal learning. Progress will require more precise definitions of different forms of vocal learning, broad comparative review of their presence and absence, and behavioral and neurobiological investigations into the mechanisms underlying the skills.},

We argue that humans’ ability to modulate nonverbal vocal features evolutionarily linked to expression of body size and sex (fundamental and formant frequencies) provides a largely overlooked window into the nature of this intermediate system. Recent behavioral and neural evidence indicates that humans’ vocal control abilities, commonly assumed to subserve speech, extend to these nonverbal dimensions. This capacity appears in continuity with context-dependent frequency modulations recently identified in other mammals, including primates, and may represent a living relic of early vocal control abilities that led to articulated human speech.},

Some evidence suggests a role of intersexual selection via female mate choice, but other evidence implicates male dominance competition. In this study, we examine the relationships among voice pitch, dominance, and male mating success. Males were audio recorded while participating in an unscripted dating-game scenario. Recordings were subsequently manipulated in voice pitch using computer software and then rated by groups of males for dominance. Results indicate that (1) a masculine, low-pitch voice increases ratings of men's physical and social dominance, augmenting the former more than the latter; and (2) men who believe they are physically dominant to their competitor lower their voice pitch when addressing him, whereas men who believe they are less dominant raise it. We also found a nonsignificant trend for men who speak at a lower pitch to report more sexual partners in the past year. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that male intrasexual competition was a salient selection pressure on the voices of ancestral males and contributed to human voice sexual dimorphism.},

	abstract = {AbstractAny account of “what is special about the human brain” (Passingham 2008) must specify the neural basis of our unique ability to produce speech and delineate how these remarkable motor capabilities could have emerged in our hominin ancestors. Clinical data suggest that the basal ganglia provide a platform for the integration of primate-general mechanisms of acoustic communication with the faculty of articulate speech in humans. Furthermore, neurobiological and paleoanthropological data point at a two-stage model of the phylogenetic evolution of this crucial prerequisite of spoken language: (i) monosynaptic refinement of the projections of motor cortex to the brainstem nuclei that steer laryngeal muscles, presumably, as part of a “phylogenetic trend” associated with increasing brain size during hominin evolution; (ii) subsequent vocal-laryngeal elaboration of cortico-basal ganglia circuitries, driven by human-specific FOXP2 mutations.;{\textgreater}This concept implies vocal continuity of spoken language evolution at the motor level, elucidating the deep entrenchment of articulate speech into a “nonverbal matrix” (Ingold 1994), which is not accounted for by gestural-origin theories. Moreover, it provides a solution to the question for the adaptive value of the “first word” (Bickerton 2009) since even the earliest and most simple verbal utterances must have increased the versatility of vocal displays afforded by the preceding elaboration of monosynaptic corticobulbar tracts, giving rise to enhanced social cooperation and prestige. At the ontogenetic level, the proposed model assumes age-dependent interactions between the basal ganglia and their cortical targets, similar to vocal learning in some songbirds. In this view, the emergence of articulate speech builds on the “renaissance” of an ancient organizational principle and, hence, may represent an example of “evolutionary tinkering” (Jacob 1977)., AbstractThe faith that “comparative analysis of the behaviour of modern primates, in conjunction with an accurate phylogenetic tree of relatedness, has the power to chart the early history of human cognitive evolution” (Byrne 2000 p. 543) runs afoul of the fact that no other primate besides humans is capable of vocal production learning. This basic enabling adaptation for articulate speech bears crucially on the reconstruction of language origins., AbstractAckermann et al. mention the “acquisition of species-atypical sounds” in apes without any discussion. In our commentary, we demonstrate that these atypical sounds in chimpanzees not only include laryngeal sounds, but also have a major significance regarding the origins of language, if we consider looking at their context of use, their social properties, their relations with gestures, their lateralization, and their neurofunctional correlates as well., AbstractSpeech prosody is essential for verbal communication. In this commentary I provide an integrative overview, arguing that speech prosody is subserved by the same anatomical and neurochemical mechanisms involved in the processing of reward/affective outcomes., AbstractNeuroimaging studies have verified the important integrative role of the basal ganglia during affective vocalizations. They, however, also point to additional regions supporting vocal monitoring, auditory–motor feedback processing, and online adjustments of vocal motor responses. For the case of affective vocalizations, we suggest partly extending the model to fully consider the link between primate-general and human-specific neural components., AbstractBuilding a theory on extant species, as Ackermann et al. do, is a useful contribution to the field of language evolution. Here, I add another living model that might be of interest: human language ontogeny in the first year of life. A better knowledge of this phase might help in understanding two more topics among the “several building blocks of a comprehensive theory of the evolution of spoken language” indicated in their conclusion by Ackermann et al., that is, the foundation of the co-evolution of linguistic motor skills with the auditory skills underlying speech perception, and the possible phylogenetic interactions of protospeech production with referential capabilities., AbstractThe primate basal ganglia are fundamental to Ackermann et al.'s proposal. However, primates and rodents are models for human cognitive functions involving basal ganglia circuits, and links between striatal function and vocal communication come from songbirds. We suggest that the proposal is better integrated in cognitive and/or motor theories on spoken language origins and with more analogous nonhuman animal models., AbstractAckermann et al. disregard attested knowledge concerning aphasia, Parkinson disease, cortical-to-striatal circuits, basal ganglia, laryngeal phonation, and other matters. Their dual-pathway model cannot account for “what is special about the human brain.” Their human cortical-to-laryngeal neural circuit does not exist. Basal ganglia operations, enhanced by mutations on FOXP2, confer human motor-control, linguistic, and cognitive capabilities., AbstractAckermann et al. treat both genetic and paleoanthropological data too superficially to support their conclusions. The case of FOXP2 and Neanderthals is a prime example, which I will comment on in some detail; the issues are much more complex than they appear in Ackermann et al., AbstractAckermann et al. provide an informative neurological road-map to primate call communication. However, the proposed model for speech evolution inadequately integrates comparative primate evidence. Critically, great ape voiceless calls are explicitly rendered unimportant, leaving the proposed model deprived of behavioral feedstock and proximate selective drivers capable of triggering the neurological transformations described by the authors in the primate brain., AbstractWe support Ackermann et al.'s proposal that the cortico-basal ganglia circuits may play essential roles in the evolution of spoken language. Here we discuss further evidence indicating that the cortico-basal ganglia circuits may contribute to various aspects of spoken language including planning, learning, and controlling of speech in adulthood., AbstractAckermann et al. discuss the lack of evidence for vocal control in nonhuman primates. We suggest that nonhuman primates may be capable of achieving greater vocal control than previously supposed. In support of this assertion, we discuss new evidence that nonhuman primates are capable of modifying spectral features in their vocalizations., AbstractAckermann et al.'s phylogenetic account of speech argues that the basal ganglia imbue speech with emotive content. However, a body of work on auditory/emotive processing is inconsistent with attributing this function exclusively to these structures. The account further overlooks the possibility that the emotion-integration function may be at least in part mediated by the cortico-ponto-cerebellar system., AbstractThe gradual audiomotor evolution hypothesis is proposed as an alternative interpretation to the auditory timing mechanisms discussed in Ackermann et al.'s article. This hypothesis accommodates the fact that the performance of nonhuman primates is comparable to humans in single-interval tasks (such as interval reproduction, categorization, and interception), but shows differences in multiple-interval tasks (such as entrainment, synchronization, and continuation)., AbstractAckermann et al.'s arguments in the target article need sharpening and rethinking at both mechanistic and evolutionary levels. First, the authors' evolutionary arguments are inconsistent with recent evidence concerning nonhuman animal rhythmic abilities. Second, prosodic intonation conveys much more complex linguistic information than mere emotional expression. Finally, human adults' basal ganglia have a considerably wider role in speech modulation than Ackermann et al. surmise., AbstractRecent evidence from very young human infants' responses to human and nonhuman primate vocalizations offers new insights–and brings new questions–to the forefront for those who seek to integrate primate-general and human-specific mechanisms of acoustic communication with theories of language acquisition., AbstractIn this response to commentaries, we revisit the two main arguments of our target article. Based on data drawn from a variety of research areas–vocal behavior in nonhuman primates, speech physiology and pathology, neurobiology of basal ganglia functions, motor skill learning, paleoanthropological concepts–the target article, first, suggests a two-stage model of the evolution of the crucial motor prerequisites of spoken language within the hominin lineage: (1) monosynaptic refinement of the projections of motor cortex to brainstem nuclei steering laryngeal muscles, and (2) subsequent “vocal-laryngeal elaboration” of cortico-basal ganglia circuits, driven by human-specific FOXP2 mutations. Second, as concerns the ontogenetic development of verbal communication, age-dependent interactions between the basal ganglia and their cortical targets are assumed to contribute to the time course of the acquisition of articulate speech. Whereas such a phylogenetic reorganization of cortico-striatal circuits must be considered a necessary prerequisite for ontogenetic speech acquisition, the 30 commentaries–addressing the whole range of data sources referred to–point at several further aspects of acoustic communication which have to be added to or integrated with the presented model. For example, the relationships between vocal tract movement sequencing–the focus of the target article–and rhythmical structures of movement organization, the connections between speech motor control and the central-auditory and central-visual systems, the impact of social factors upon the development of vocal behavior (in nonhuman primates and in our species), and the interactions of ontogenetic speech acquisition–based upon FOXP2-driven structural changes at the level of the basal ganglia–with preceding subvocal stages of acoustic communication as well as higher-order (cognitive) dimensions of phonological development. Most importantly, thus, several promising future research directions unfold from these contributions–accessible to clinical studies and functional imaging in our species as well as experimental investigations in nonhuman primates., AbstractLanguage production is a multilevel phenomenon, and human capacities to communicate vocally progress from early forms, based on projections of motor cortex to brainstem nuclei, to complex elaborations, mediated by high-order cognition and fostered by socially mediated feedback., AbstractEarly human vocal development is characterized first by emerging control of phonation and later by prosodic and supraglottal articulation. The target article has missed the opportunity to use these facts in the characterization of evolution in language-specific brain mechanisms. Phonation appears to be the initial human-specific brain change for language, and it was presumably a key target of selection in early hominin evolution., AbstractContradicting new dual-pathway models of language evolution, cortico-striatal-thalamic circuitry disambiguate uncertainties in affective prosody and propositional linguistic content of language production and comprehension, predictably setting limits on useful complexity of articulate phonic and/or signed speech. Such limits likely evolved to ensure public information is discriminated by intended communicants and safeguarded against the ecological pressures of social eavesdropping within and across phylogenetic boundaries.},

All males in a population sing the current version of the constantly evolving display and, within an ocean basin, populations sing similar songs; however, this sharing can be complex. In the western and central South Pacific region there is repeated cultural transmission of song types from eastern Australia to other populations eastward. Song sharing is hypothesized to occur through several possible mechanisms. Here, we present the first example of feeding ground song from the Southern Ocean Antarctic Area V and compare it to song from the two closest breeding populations. The early 2010 song contained at least four distinct themes; these matched four themes from the eastern Australian 2009 song, and the same four themes from the New Caledonian 2010 song recorded later in the year. This provides evidence for at least one of the hypothesized mechanisms of song transmission between these two populations, singing while on shared summer feeding grounds. In addition, the feeding grounds may provide a point of acoustic contact to allow the rapid horizontal cultural transmission of song within the western and central South Pacific region and the wider Southern Ocean.},

To investigate the process of within-flock convergence through which these differences arise, an experimental flock of birds previously unfamiliar with each other was established and maintained in captivity. The vocal behaviour of each individual was monitored over several weeks. Acoustic analyses revealed that significant vocal convergence occurred in less than 1 week after the birds were initially exposed to each other. No single individual appeared to provide a vocal model that other birds copied. Acoustic differences appeared in the spectral structure of the D-note of this complex call, especially in the frequency difference between adjacent overtones and in the bandwidth. Both of these acoustic features are attributable to specific physiological mechanisms of production. The significance of vocal plasticity in chickadees and its relationship to production and perception are discussed.},

One case where vocal learning should be favoured by selection is where calls indicate group membership and group mates are unrelated. Female greater spear–nosed bats, Phyllostomus hastatus, live in stable groups of unrelated bats and use loud, broadband calls to coordinate foraging movements of social group mates. Bats benefit from group foraging. Calls differ between female social groups and cave colonies, and playback experiments demonstrate that bats perceive these acoustic differences. Here I show that the group distinctive structure of calls arises through vocal learning. Females change call structure when group composition changes, resulting in increased similarity among new social group mates. Comparisons of transfers with age–matched half–sibs indicate that call changes are not simply due to maturation, the physical environment or heredity. These results suggest that studies testing vocal learning in mammals could profit by focusing on vocalizations that signify group membership.},

In oscine songbirds, where learned song is most prevalent, it is used primarily for intrasexual selection and mate attraction. Learning of a different class of vocal signals, known as contact calls, is found in a diverse array of species, where they are used to mediate social interactions among individuals. We argue that call learning provides a taxonomically rich system for studying testable hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of vocal learning. We describe and critically evaluate four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin and current function of vocal learning of calls, which propose that call learning (1) improves auditory detection and recognition, (2) signals local knowledge, (3) signals group membership, or (4) allows for the encoding of more complex social information. We propose approaches to testing these four hypotheses but emphasize that all of them share the idea that social living, not sexual selection, is a central driver of vocal learning. Finally, we identify future areas for research on call learning that could provide new perspectives on the origins and mechanisms of vocal learning in both animals and humans.},

	abstract = {Acoustic communication is fundamental in avian territory defence and mate attraction. In urban environments where sound transmissions are more likely to be masked by low-frequency anthropogenic noise, acoustic adaptations may be advantageous. However, minor modifications to a signal could affect its efficacy. While recent research has shown that there is divergence between songs from noisy and quiet areas, it is unknown whether these differences affect the response to the signal by its receivers. Here, we show that there is a difference in spectral aspects of rural and urban song in a common passerine, the great tit Parus major, at 20 sites across the UK. We also provide, to our knowledge, the first demonstration that such environmentally induced differences in song influence the response of male territory holders. Males from quiet territories exhibited a significantly stronger response when hearing song from another territory holder with low background noise than from those with high background noise. The opposite distinction in response intensity to homotypic versus heterotypic song was observed in males from noisy territories. This behavioural difference may intensify further signal divergence between urban and rural populations and raises important questions concerning signal evolution.},

	abstract = {Environmental noise can affect acoustic communication through limiting the broadcast area, or active space, of a signal by decreasing signal-to-noise ratios at the position of the receiver. At the same time, noise is ubiquitous in all habitats and is, therefore, likely to disturb animals, as well as humans, under many circumstances. However, both animals and humans have evolved diverse solutions to the background noise problem, and this chapter reviews recent advancements in studies of vocal adaptations to interference by background noise and relate these to fundamental issues in sound perception. The chapter starts with the discussion of sender's side by considering potential evolutionary shaping of species-specific signal characteristics and individual short‐term adjustments of signal features. Subsequently, it focuses on the receivers of signals and reviews their sensory capacities for signal detection, recognition, and discrimination and relates these issues to auditory scene analysis and the ecological concept of signal space. The data from studies on insects, anurans, birds, and mammals, including humans, and to a lesser extent available work on fish and reptiles is also discussed in the chapter.},

	abstract = {The Lombard effect, an involuntary rise in call amplitude in response to masking ambient noise, represents one of the most efficient mechanisms to optimize signal-to-noise ratio. The Lombard effect occurs in birds and mammals, including humans, and is often associated with several other vocal changes, such as call frequency and duration. Most studies, however, have focused on noise-dependent changes in call amplitude. It is therefore still largely unknown how the adaptive changes in call amplitude relate to associated vocal changes such as frequency shifts, how the underlying mechanisms are linked, and if auditory feedback from the changing vocal output is needed. Here, we examined the Lombard effect and the associated changes in call frequency in a highly vocal mammal, echolocating horseshoe bats. We analyzed how bandpass-filtered noise (BFN; bandwidth 20 kHz) affected their echolocation behavior when BFN was centered on different frequencies within their hearing range. Call amplitudes increased only when BFN was centered on the dominant frequency component of the bats’ calls. In contrast, call frequencies increased for all but one BFN center frequency tested. Both amplitude and frequency rises were extremely fast and occurred in the first call uttered after noise onset, suggesting that no auditory feedback was required. The different effects that varying the BFN center frequency had on amplitude and frequency rises indicate different neural circuits and/or mechanisms underlying these changes.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic (man-made) noise has changed the acoustic environment both on land and underwater and is now recognized as a pollutant of international concern. Increasing numbers of studies are assessing how noise pollution affects animals across a range of scales, from individuals to communities, but the topic receiving the most research attention has been acoustic communication. Although there is now an extensive literature on how signalers might avoid potential masking from anthropogenic noise, the vast majority of the work has been conducted on birds and marine mammals. Fish represent more than half of all vertebrate species, are a valuable and increasingly utilized model taxa for understanding behavior, and provide the primary source of protein for \textgreater1 billion people and the principal livelihoods for hunderds of millions. Assessing the impacts of noise on fish is therefore of clear biological, ecological, and societal importance. Here, we begin by indicating why acoustic communication in fish is likely to be impacted by anthropogenic noise. We then use studies from other taxa to outline 5 main ways in which animals can alter their acoustic signaling behavior when there is potential masking due to anthropogenic noise and assess evidence of evolutionary adaptation and behavioral plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic noise sources to consider whether such changes are feasible in fish. Finally, we suggest directions for future study of fish acoustic behavior in this context and highlight why such research may allow important advances in our general understanding of the impact of this global pollutant.},

The purpose of this study was to clarify whether the Lombard reflex can be evoked during controlled vocalization in an animal model. In decerebrate cats, repetitive electrical stimulation was applied to the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) to evoke vocalization. Pure tone auditory stimulation was delivered through a loudspeaker. The activities of the laryngeal adductor muscle, diaphragm and external oblique abdominal muscle and the voice intensity were measured during PAG stimulation, in the presence and absence of the auditory stimulation. To clarify the effects of the auditory–laryngeal reflex on the activity of laryngeal adductor motoneurons, the amplitude of the laryngeal reflex evoked by single shock stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve was also measured during respiration, in the presence and absence of auditory stimulation. The sound made by the cats due to PAG-induced vocalization was augmented by exposure to auditory stimulation, and the activities of the laryngeal adductor muscle and external oblique abdominal muscle were also augmented. During respiration, auditory stimulation also increased the amplitude of the laryngeal reflex evoked in the laryngeal adductor muscle. These results demonstrate that the essential neuronal mechanisms for evoking the Lombard reflex exist within the brainstem.},

	abstract = {Urban noise can interfere with avian communication through masking, but birds can reduce this interference by altering their vocalizations. Although several experimental studies indicate that birds can rapidly change their vocalizations in response to sudden increases in ambient noise, none have investigated whether this is a learned response that depends on previous exposure. Black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) change the frequency of their songs in response to both fluctuating traffic noise and experimental noise. We investigated whether these responses to fluctuating noise depend on familiarity with noise. We confirmed that males in noisy areas sang higher-frequency songs than those in quiet areas, but found that only males in already-noisy territories shifted songs upwards in immediate response to experimental noise. Unexpectedly, males in more quiet territories shifted songs downwards in response to experimental noise. These results suggest that chickadees may require prior experience with fluctuating noise to adjust vocalizations in such a way as to minimize masking. Thus, learning to cope may be an important part of adjusting to acoustic life in the city.},

	abstract = {Some animals that use sound to communicate compensate for interference from background noise by adjusting the amplitude of their vocalizations as environmental noise levels vary. Territorial songbirds may have evolved a different strategy, since they can be expected to benefit from maximizing the amplitude of their songs to defend territories and attract females. We tested this hypothesis with calibrated measurements of the song level of male nightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos. All birds increased the sound level of their songs in response to an increase in white noise broadcast to them. A second experiment revealed that noise in the spectral region of their own songs was most effective in inducing the birds to increase vocal intensity. These findings show that nightingales do not maximize song amplitude but regulate vocal intensity dependent on the level of masking noise. The adjustment of vocal amplitude may serve to maintain a specific signal-to-noise ratio that is favourable for signal production. Concurrently, increasing the intensity of songs can maintain a given active space for communication. Thus, vocal amplitude in a territorial songbird can be interpreted as a flexible trait, which is individually regulated according to ecological demands from signal transmission.

	abstract = {The adjustment of the voice by auditory input happens at several brain levels. The caudal pontine brainstem, though rarely investigated, is one candidate area for such audio–vocal integration. We recorded neuronal activity in this area in awake, behaving squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) during vocal communication, using telemetric single-unit recording techniques. We found audio–vocal neurons at locations not described before, namely in the periolivary region of the superior olivary complex and the adjacent pontine reticular formation. They showed various responses to external sounds (noise bursts) and activity increases (excitation) or decreases (inhibition) to self-produced vocalizations, starting prior to vocal onset and continuing through vocalizations. In most of them, the responses to noise bursts and self-produced vocalizations were similar, with the only difference that neuronal activity started prior to vocal onset. About one-third responded phasically to noise bursts, independent of whether they increased or decreased their activity to vocalization. The activity of most audio–vocal neurons correlated with basic acoustic features of the vocalization, such as call duration and/or syllable structure. Auditory neurons near audio–vocal neurons showed significantly more frequent phasic response patterns than those in areas without audio–vocal activity. Based on these findings, we propose that audio–vocal neurons showing similar activity to external acoustical stimuli and vocalization play a role in olivocochlear regulation. Specifically, audio–vocal neurons with a phasic response to external auditory stimuli are candidates for the mediation of basal audio–vocal reflexes such as the Lombard reflex. Thus, our findings suggest that complex audio–vocal integration mechanisms exist in the ventrolateral pontine brainstem.},

The vocal imitation and reduced dispersal hypotheses are alternatives to explain this mismatch between vocal and genetic variation. We experimentally simulated dispersal in the yellow-naped amazon (Amazona auropalliata) by moving individuals within and across dialect boundaries in Costa Rica. One juvenile translocated across dialect boundaries altered its contact call to imitate the acoustic form of the local call six weeks post-release. In contrast, four adults translocated across dialect boundaries returned to their original capture site within 120 days, while five cross-dialect translocated adults who remained at the release site did not alter their contact calls. Translocated individuals were observed to show some segregation from resident flocks. The observation of vocal imitation by the juvenile bird supports the vocal imitation, whereas the behavior of adults is more consistent with the reduced dispersal hypotheses. Taken together, our results suggest that both post-dispersal learning by juveniles and high philopatry in adults could explain the stability of vocal dialects in the face of immigration and gene flow.},

All three groups showed similar production patterns when F1 was decreased; however, when F1 was increased, the Japanese groups did not compensate as much as the native English speakers.

	abstract = {Vocal communication in nonhuman primates receives considerable research attention, with many investigators arguing for similarities between this calling and speech in humans. Data from development and neural organization show a central role of affect in monkey and ape sounds, however, suggesting that their calls are homologous to spontaneous human emotional vocalizations while having little relation to spoken language. Based on this evidence, we propose two principles that can be useful in evaluating the many and disparate empirical findings that bear on the nature of vocal production in nonhuman and human primates. One principle distinguishes production-first from reception-first vocal development, referring to the markedly different role of auditory-motor experience in each case. The second highlights a phenomenon dubbed dual neural pathways, specifically that when a species with an existing vocal system evolves a new functionally distinct vocalization capability, it occurs through emergence of a second parallel neural pathway rather than through expansion of the extant circuitry. With these principles as a backdrop, we review evidence of acoustic modification of calling associated with background noise, conditioning effects, audience composition, and vocal convergence and divergence in nonhuman primates. Although each kind of evidence has been interpreted to show flexible cognitively mediated control over vocal production, we suggest that most are more consistent with affectively grounded mechanisms. The lone exception is production of simple, novel sounds in great apes, which is argued to reveal at least some degree of volitional vocal control. If also present in early hominins, the cortically based circuitry surmised to be associated with these rudimentary capabilities likely also provided the substrate for later emergence of the neural pathway allowing volitional production in modern humans.

However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms of rodent USV production. Here we discuss the available data to assess whether male mouse song behavior and the supporting brain circuits resemble those of known vocal non-learning or vocal learning species. Recent neurobiology studies have demonstrated that the mouse USV brain system includes motor cortex and striatal regions, and that the vocal motor cortex sends a direct sparse projection to the brainstem vocal motor nucleus ambiguous, a projection previously thought be unique to humans among mammals. Recent behavioral studies have reported opposing conclusions on mouse vocal plasticity, including vocal ontogeny changes in USVs over early development that might not be explained by innate maturation processes, evidence for and against a role for auditory feedback in developing and maintaining normal mouse USVs, and evidence for and against limited vocal imitation of song pitch. To reconcile these findings, we suggest that the trait of vocal learning may not be dichotomous but encompass a broad spectrum of behavioral and neural traits we call the continuum hypothesis, and that mice possess some of the traits associated with a capacity for limited vocal learning.},

Subjects listened to syllables requiring different patterns of dorso-ventral and antero-posterior movements (/ki/, /ko/, /ti/, /to/). Results show that passive listening to speech sounds evokes a pattern of motor synergies mirroring those occurring during speech production. Moreover, mirror motor synergies were more evident in those subjects showing good performances in discriminating speech in noise demonstrating a role of the speech-related mirror system in feed-forward processing the speaker's ongoing motor plan.},

	abstract = {The precise neural mechanisms underlying speech perception are still to a large extent unknown. The most accepted view is that speech perception depends on auditory-cognitive mechanisms specifically devoted to the analysis of speech sounds. An alternative view is that, crucial for speech perception, it is the activation of the articulatory (motor) gestures that generate these sounds. The listener understands the speaker when his/her articulatory gestures are activated (motor theory of speech perception). Here, by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we demonstrate that, during speech listening, there is an increase of motor-evoked potentials recorded from the listeners' tongue muscles when the presented words strongly involve, when pronounced, tongue movements. Although these data do not prove the motor theory of speech perception, they demonstrate for the first time that word listening produces a phoneme specific activation of speech motor centres.},

We examined the possibility that perception of speech, both auditory and visual, would also result in changes in the excitability of the motor system underlying speech production. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the face area of primary motor cortex to elicit motor-evoked potentials in the lip muscles. The size of the motor-evoked potentials was compared under the following conditions: listening to speech, listening to non-verbal sounds, viewing speech-related lip movements, and viewing eye and brow movements. Compared to control conditions, listening to and viewing speech enhanced the size of the motor-evoked potential. This effect was only seen in response to stimulation of the left hemisphere; stimulation of the right hemisphere produced no changes in motor-evoked potentials in any of the conditions. In a control experiment, the size of the motor-evoked potentials elicited in the muscles of the right hand did not differ among conditions, suggesting that speech-related changes in excitability are specific to the lip muscles. These results provide evidence that both auditory and visual speech perception facilitate the excitability of the motor system involved in speech production.},

	abstract = {Learned song is among the best-studied models of animal communication. In oscine songbirds, where learned song is most prevalent, it is used primarily for intrasexual selection and mate attraction. Learning of a different class of vocal signals, known as contact calls, is found in a diverse array of species, where they are used to mediate social interactions among individuals. We argue that call learning provides a taxonomically rich system for studying testable hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of vocal learning. We describe and critically evaluate four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the origin and current function of vocal learning of calls, which propose that call learning (1) improves auditory detection and recognition, (2) signals local knowledge, (3) signals group membership, or (4) allows for the encoding of more complex social information. We propose approaches to testing these four hypotheses but emphasize that all of them share the idea that social living, not sexual selection, is a central driver of vocal learning. Finally, we identify future areas for research on call learning that could provide new perspectives on the origins and mechanisms of vocal learning in both animals and humans.},

	abstract = {Expression of the immediate early gene protein Zenk (zif 268, egr-1, NGF1A,Krox24) was induced in forebrain auditory nuclei in a vocal learning parrot species, the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), when the subjects either listened to playbacks of an unfamiliar contact call or to a contact call with which they had been familiarized previously. Auditory nuclei included the Field L complex (L1, L2a, and L3), the neostriatum intermedium pars ventrolateralis (NIVL), the neostriatum adjacent to caudal nucleus basalis (peri-basalis or pBas), an area in the frontal lateral neostriatum (NFl), the supracentral nucleus of the lateral neostriatum (NLs), and the ventromedial hyperstriatum ventrale (HVvm). The latter three nuclei are main sources of auditory input to the vocal system. Two patterns of nuclear staining were induced by contact call stimulation—staining throughout cell nuclei, which was exhibited by at least some neurons in all areas examined except L2a and perinucleolar staining, which was the only kind of staining exhibited in field L2a. The different patterns of Zenk staining indicate that auditory stimulation may regulate the Zenk-dependent transcription of different subsets of genes in different auditory nuclei. The numbers of neurons expressing Zenk staining increased from seven- to 43-fold over control levels when the birds listened to a repeating unfamiliar call. Familiarization of the subjects with the call stimulus, through repeated playbacks, greatly reduced the induction of Zenk expression to the call when it was presented again after an intervening 24-h interval. To determine if neurons exhibiting contact call-driven Zenk expression project to the vocal control system, call stimulation was coupled with dextran amines pathway tracing. The results indicated that tracer injections in the vocal nucleus HVo (oval nucleus of the hyperstriatum ventrale), in fields lateral to HVo and in NLs labeled many Zenk-positive neurons in HVvm, NFl, and NLs. These results support the idea that, in these neurons, egr-1 couples auditory stimulation to the synthesis of proteins involved in either the storing of new perceptual engrams for vocal learning or the processing of novel and/or meaningful acoustic stimuli related to vocal learning or the context in which it occurs.},

One idea is that this correspondence is established at the level of single neurons that are active when the individual performs a particular gesture or observes a similar gesture performed by another individual. Although neurons that display a precise auditory–vocal correspondence could facilitate vocal communication, they have yet to be identified. Here we report that a certain class of neurons in the swamp sparrow forebrain displays a precise auditory–vocal correspondence. We show that these neurons respond in a temporally precise fashion to auditory presentation of certain note sequences in this songbird's repertoire and to similar note sequences in other birds' songs. These neurons display nearly identical patterns of activity when the bird sings the same sequence, and disrupting auditory feedback does not alter this singing-related activity, indicating it is motor in nature. Furthermore, these neurons innervate striatal structures important for song learning, raising the possibility that singing-related activity in these cells is compared to auditory feedback to guide vocal learning.},

	abstract = {Songbirds are capable of vocal learning and communication and are ideally suited to the study of neural mechanisms of complex sensory and motor processing. Vocal communication in a noisy bird colony and vocal learning of a specific song template both require the ability to monitor auditory feedback to distinguish self-generated vocalizations from external sounds and to identify mismatches between the developing song and a memorized template acquired from a tutor. However, neurons that respond to auditory feedback from vocal output have not been found in song-control areas despite intensive searching. Here we investigate feedback processing outside the traditional song system, in single auditory forebrain neurons of juvenile zebra finches that were in a late developmental stage of song learning. Overall, we found similarity of spike responses during singing and during playback of the bird's own song, with song responses commonly leading by a few milliseconds. However, brief time-locked acoustic perturbations of auditory feedback revealed complex sensitivity that could not be predicted from passive playback responses. Some neurons that responded to playback perturbations did not respond to song perturbations, which is reminiscent of sensory-motor mirror neurons. By contrast, some neurons were highly feedback sensitive in that they responded vigorously to song perturbations, but not to unperturbed songs or perturbed playback. These findings suggest that a computational function of forebrain auditory areas may be to detect errors between actual feedback and mirrored feedback deriving from an internal model of the bird's own song or that of its tutor. Such feedback-sensitive spikes could constitute the key signals that trigger adaptive motor responses to song disruptions or reinforce exploratory motor gestures for vocal learning.},

	abstract = {The brain basis for auditory working memory, the process of actively maintaining sounds in memory over short periods of time, is controversial. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants, we demonstrate that the maintenance of single tones in memory is associated with activation in auditory cortex. In addition, sustained activation was observed in hippocampus and inferior frontal gyrus. Multivoxel pattern analysis showed that patterns of activity in auditory cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus distinguished the tone that was maintained in memory. Functional connectivity during maintenance was demonstrated between auditory cortex and both the hippocampus and inferior frontal cortex. The data support a system for auditory working memory based on the maintenance of sound-specific representations in auditory cortex by projections from higher-order areas, including the hippocampus and frontal cortex.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT In this work, we demonstrate a system for maintaining sound in working memory based on activity in auditory cortex, hippocampus, and frontal cortex, and functional connectivity among them. Specifically, our work makes three advances from the previous work. First, we robustly demonstrate hippocampal involvement in all phases of auditory working memory (encoding, maintenance, and retrieval): the role of hippocampus in working memory is controversial. Second, using a pattern classification technique, we show that activity in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus is specific to the maintained tones in working memory. Third, we show long-range connectivity of auditory cortex to hippocampus and frontal cortex, which may be responsible for keeping such representations active during working memory maintenance.},

At least two changes were necessary prerequisites for modern human speech abilities: (1) modification of vocal tract morphology, and (2) development of vocal imitative ability. Despite an extensive literature, attempts to pinpoint the timing of these changes using fossil data have proven inconclusive. However, recent comparative data from nonhuman primates have shed light on the ancestral use of formants (a crucial cue in human speech) to identify individuals and gauge body size. Second, comparative analysis of the diverse vertebrates that have evolved vocal imitation (humans, cetaceans, seals and birds) provides several distinct, testable hypotheses about the adaptive function of vocal mimicry. These developments suggest that, for understanding the evolution of speech, comparative analysis of living species provides a viable alternative to fossil data. However, the neural basis for vocal mimicry and for mimesis in general remains unknown.},

In the current study we analyse where the processing costs of regional dialects come from, a question that has not been answered yet. We quantify the proficiency of Basque–Spanish bilinguals who have different native dialects of Basque on many dimensions and test for costs at each of three levels of processing–phonemic discrimination, word recognition, and semantic processing. The ability to discriminate a dialect-specific contrast is affected by a bilingual's linguistic background less than lexical access is, and an individual's difficulty in lexical access is correlated with basic discrimination problems. Once lexical access is achieved, dialectal variation has little impact on semantic processing. The results are discussed in terms of the presence or absence of correlations between different processing levels. The implications of the results are considered for how models of spoken word recognition handle dialectal variation.},

This holds for speech motor control as well, where both auditory and somatosensory information have been shown to play a key role. Recent clinical research demonstrates that individuals with severe speech production deficits can show a dramatic improvement in fluency during online mimicking of an audiovisual speech signal suggesting the existence of a visuomotor pathway for speech motor control. Here we used fMRI in healthy individuals to identify this new visuomotor circuit for speech production. Participants were asked to perceive and covertly rehearse nonsense syllable sequences presented auditorily, visually, or audiovisually. The motor act of rehearsal, which is prima facie the same whether or not it is cued with a visible talker, produced different patterns of sensorimotor activation when cued by visual or audiovisual speech (relative to auditory speech). In particular, a network of brain regions including the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and several frontoparietal sensorimotor areas activated more strongly during rehearsal cued by a visible talker versus rehearsal cued by auditory speech alone. Some of these brain regions responded exclusively to rehearsal cued by visual or audiovisual speech. This result has significant implications for models of speech motor control, for the treatment of speech output disorders, and for models of the role of speech gesture imitation in development.},

Birds have no cortex, but recent studies in parrots and corvids show that their cognitive skills are on par with primates. These cognitive findings are accompanied by neurobiological discoveries that reveal avian and mammalian forebrains are homologous, and show similarities in connectivity and function down to the cellular level. But because birds have a large pallium, but no cortex, a specific cortical architecture cannot be a requirement for advanced cognitive skills. During the long parallel evolution of mammals and birds, several neural mechanisms for cognition and complex behaviors may have converged despite an overall forebrain organization that is otherwise vastly different., Cognition in corvids and parrots reaches the same level of excellence and diversity as in apes. Among others, bird cognition encompasses abilities such as delay of gratification, mental time travel, reasoning, metacognition, mirror self-recognition, theory of mind, and third-party intervention., The cerebrum of birds and mammals is homologous but very differently organized., Birds lack a neocortex but have instead several large pallial aggregations without apparent laminar structure. However, according to some scientists, these aggregations might correspond to cortical layers., Independent from each other, birds and mammals have developed similar brain organizations that could constitute the neural basis of their cognitive skills. Birds have a functional analog to the prefrontal cortex that generates executive functions. Their telencephalic connectome is highly similar to that of diverse mammalian species and they show a ‘hidden’ lamination that resembles cortical canonical circuits in parts of their sensory pallial territories.},

Previous studies of the Lombard effect have typically focused on the relationship between speaking and hearing. Automatic and involuntary increases in motor output have also been noted in studies of finger force production, an effect attributed to mechanisms of sensory attenuation. The present study tested the hypothesis that sensory attenuation mechanisms also underlie expression of the Lombard effect. Participants vocalized phonemes in time with a metronome, while auditory and visual feedback of their performance were manipulated or removed during the course of the trial. We demonstrate that providing a visual reference to calibrate somatosensory-based judgments of current vocal intensity resulted in reduced expression of the Lombard effect. Our results suggest that sensory attenuation effects typically seen in fingertip force production play an important role in the control of speech volume.},

Most behavioural research and neuroimaging research in this area has concentrated on the effect of energetic maskers such as white noise on Lombard speech. Previous fMRI studies have argued that neural responses to speaking in noise are driven by the quality of auditory feedback—that is, the audibility of the speaker's voice over the masker. However, we also frequently produce speech in the presence of informational maskers such as another talker. Here, speakers read sentences over a range of maskers varying in their informational and energetic content: speech, rotated speech, speech modulated noise, and white noise. Subjects also spoke in quiet and listened to the maskers without speaking. When subjects spoke in masking sounds, their vocal intensity increased in line with the energetic content of the masker. However, the opposite pattern was found neurally. In the superior temporal gyrus, activation was most strongly associated with increases in informational, rather than energetic, masking. This suggests that the neural activations associated with speaking in noise are more complex than a simple feedback response.},

	abstract = {Trying to uncover the roots of human speech and language has been the premier motivation to study the signalling behaviour of nonhuman primates for several decades. Focussing on the question of whether we find evidence for linguistic reference in the production of nonhuman primate vocalizations, I will first discuss how the criteria used to diagnose referential signalling have changed over time, and will then turn to the paradigmatic case of semantic communication in animals, the alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus. A recent in-depth analysis of the original material revealed that, while the alarm calls could be well distinguished, calls of similar structure were also used in within- and between-group aggression. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the idea that calls denote objects in the environment. Furthermore, nonhuman primates show only minimal signs of vocal production learning, one key prerequisite for conventionalized and symbolic communication. In addition, the structure of calls in different populations or closely related species is highly conserved. In conclusion, any continuity between nonhuman primate and human communication appears to be found at the level of the processing of signals. Why and how the ancestors of our own species one day began to talk to each other continues to be an enigma. Future research should focus on changes in the neural structure supporting volitional control over vocalizations, the gene networks associated with vocal production, and the developmental processes involved in the integration of production and perception of vocalizations.},

Calls given by males from the well-known Gombe and Mahale populations typically consist of four different phases: an introduction, build-up, climax, and let-down. Recent observations suggest that chimpanzees living in the Kibale National Park, Uganda, consistently give calls that lack a build-up and are thus qualitatively distinguishable acoustically from those made by other East African conspecifics. We analyzed additional recordings from Mahale and Kibale to re-examine geographic variation in chimpanzee calls. Results indicate that males from both sites produce pant hoots containing all four parts of the call. Calls made by chimpanzees from the two populations, however, differ in quantitative acoustic measures. Specifically, males at Kibale initiate their calls with significantly longer elements and build-up over briefer periods at slower rates than individuals from Mahale. Kibale males also deliver acoustically less variable calls than chimpanzees at Mahale. Although climax elements do not differ between populations in any single acoustic feature, discriminant function analysis reveals that acoustic variables can be used in combination to assign calls to the correct population at rates higher than that expected by chance. Ecological factors related to differences in habitat acoustics, the sound environment of the local biota, and body size are likely to account for these observed macrogeographic variations in chimpanzee calls.},

	abstract = {This review centers on the neural mechanisms underlying the primate cognitive control of vocalizations, i.e. the capacity to regulate vocal productions in a goal-directed manner. In both human and non-human primates (NHPs), two main frontal brain regions are associated with top-down vocal control: a ventrolateral frontal region (VLF), comprising the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and ventral premotor region; and a dorsomedial frontal region (DMF), comprising the mid-cingulate cortex, pre-supplementary and supplementary motor areas. These regions are cytoarchitectonically comparable across humans and NHPs and could serve generic functions in primate vocal control. Here, we first summarize the key anatomical properties of VLF and DMF regions as well as their involvements in the motor and cognitive control of vocalizations in both humans and NHPs. Finally, in light of the reviewed evidence, we discuss the existence of a primate VLF-DMF network and its generic functions in the cognitive control of vocalizations. We further suggest how this network and its functions may have changed across primate evolution to enable modern human speech.},

Additional evidence extends call learning to other carduelines bringing to eight the total number of genera in which call learning has been observed. Call learning is perhaps characteristic of subfamily Carduelinae, and the taxonomist should consider the possibility that learning may affect the patterns of all adult cardueline vocalizations. The taxonomic value of cardueline calls in particular and passerine calls in general is re-examined in light of this extensive call learning. It is suggested that the ontogenetic, learned modification in call pattern can be eliminated from the taxonomic analysis, and that calls may then be taxonomically valuable behavioral characters. The problem of homologizing behavior is discussed, with criteria for homology applied to two call types, both associated with call learning. Cardueline flight calls are autapoinorphic characters useful as species specific characters, while social/alarm calls are synapomorphic at the subfamilial level and can be used as taxonomic characters at the family level.},

	abstract = {Organisms that use vocal signals to communicate often modulate their vocalizations to avoid being masked by other sounds in the environment. Although some environmental noise is continuous, both biotic and abiotic noise can be intermittent, or even periodic. Interference from intermittent noise can be avoided if calls are timed to coincide with periods of silence, a capacity that is unambiguously present in insects, amphibians, birds, and humans. Surprisingly, we know virtually nothing about this fundamental capacity in nonhuman primates. Here we show that a New World monkey, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), can restrict calls to periodic silent intervals in loud white noise. In addition, calls produced during these silent intervals were significantly louder than calls recorded in silent baseline sessions. Finally, average call duration dropped across sessions, indicating that experience with temporally patterned noise caused tamarins to compress their calls. Taken together, these results show that in the presence of a predictable, intermittent environmental noise, cotton-top tamarins are able to modify the duration, timing, and amplitude of their calls to avoid acoustic interference.},

	abstract = {Vocal imitation is a phenotype that is unique to humans among all primate species, and so an understanding of its neural basis is critical in explaining the emergence of both speech and song in human evolution. Two principal neural models of vocal imitation have emerged from a consideration of nonhuman animals. One hypothesis suggests that putative mirror neurons in the inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis of Broca's area may be important for imitation. An alternative hypothesis derived from the study of songbirds suggests that the corticostriate motor pathway performs sensorimotor processes that are specific to vocal imitation. Using fMRI with a sparse event-related sampling design, we investigated the neural basis of vocal imitation in humans by comparing imitative vocal production of pitch sequences with both nonimitative vocal production and pitch discrimination. The strongest difference between these tasks was found in the putamen bilaterally, providing a striking parallel to the role of the analogous region in songbirds. Other areas preferentially activated during imitation included the orofacial motor cortex, Rolandic operculum, and SMA, which together outline the corticostriate motor loop. No differences were seen in the inferior frontal gyrus. The corticostriate system thus appears to be the central pathway for vocal imitation in humans, as predicted from an analogy with songbirds.},

Six university professors and 22 university students made short laboratory monologs in which they explained something that they knew well to a listener 6 m away. Seven students also described a map with the intention of correctly explaining directions to a listener who drew the path on a blank chart. Longer speech samples were made by 25 primary school teachers in classrooms. A tendency to increase the voicing periods as the RT increased was on average observed for the university professors, the school teachers, and the university students who described a map. These students also showed longer silence periods than the students who made short monologs. The recognized trends concerned voice professionals or subjects who were highly motivated to make themselves understood in a perturbed speaking situation. Nonparametric statistical tests, which were applied to detect the differences in distributions of voicing and silence periods, have basically supported the findings.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the effects of talker-to-listener distance (TLD) on tone and examines its impact on tone perception by both native listeners and second language learners.

Speakers naturally adjust vocal effort to talk to people at different distances, which leads to changes not only in intensity, duration and formant frequencies, but also in fundamental frequency (f0). Fundamental frequency is the primary acoustic cue that differentiates Mandarin lexical tones from one another. This study aims to answer the question of whether changes in f0 as a function of TLD affect tone perception by native (L1) and second language (L2) listeners. If so, what are the specific changes that have an impact on tone perception?

The production study investigates the acoustic correlates of the effects of TLD on tone, using 7959 monosyllabic Mandarin speech files recorded by three speakers under 11 levels of TLD. The perception study explores the effects of TLD on L1 and L2 tone perception by 2 native listeners and 52 L2 listeners.

The effects of TLD on speech production are systematic, and we present models and analyses with sufficient detail to simulate these effects. Intensity, duration, and initial and maximum f0 increase along with TLD, while time-normalized toneshapes remain invariant. The results of the perception study show that native listeners' performance is robust under changes in TLD, while L2 listeners' perception of tone interacts with TLD. One significant finding is that tone 3 recognition improves with TLD.

This work investigates the relationship between speech production and perception when acoustic attributes change naturally in response to the demands of speech communication. The results have potential applications in speech synthesis, pronunciation training and second language testing.},

	abstract = {In humans, whispering has evolved as a counteractive strategy against eavesdropping. Some evidence for whisper-like behavior exists in a few other species, but has not been reported in non-human primates. We discovered the first evidence of whisper-like behavior in a non-human primate, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), in the course of investigating their use of human-directed mobbing calls. We exposed a family of captive cotton-top tamarins to a supervisor who previously elicited a strong mobbing response. Simultaneous audio–video recordings documented the animals' behavioral and vocal responses in the supervisor's presence and absence. Rather than exhibiting a mobbing response and producing loud human-directed mobbing calls, the tamarins exhibited other anti-predator behaviors and produced low amplitude vocalizations that initially eluded our detection. A post-hoc analysis of the data was conducted to test a new hypothesis—the tamarins were reducing the amplitude of their vocalizations in the context of exposure to a potential threat. Consistent with whisper-like behavior, the amplitude of the tamarins' vocalizations was significantly reduced only in the presence of the supervisor. Due to its subtle properties, this phenomenon may have eluded detection in this species. Increasing evidence of whisper-like behavior in non-human species suggests that such low amplitude signaling may represent a convergence in a communication strategy amongst highly social and cooperative species.

Rapid expansion of human populations, accompanied by noise that comes with industrialization and motorized transportation, poses a threat for many acoustically communicating species. Although a significant amount of effort has been made exploring the responses of organisms inhabiting marine and terrestrial environments to elevated noise levels, relatively little has been directed toward organisms inhabiting small, lotic, freshwater systems. The aim of this study was to determine what effect elevated noise levels have on acoustic signals and inter-fish distance during sound production in the Blacktail Shiner, Cyprinella venusta. We hypothesized, based on the behaviors of other vocal organisms, that C. venusta would compensate for elevated noise levels by decreasing distance between sender and receiver, increasing signal amplitude (Lombard effect), or by changing temporal patterns to increase call redundancy. Using an experimental approach, we found that C. venusta altered several acoustic components under noisy conditions. Most notably, spectral levels of acoustic signals were increased in background noise, indicating presence of the Lombard effect in fishes. Inter-fish distance was typically not different between noisy and quiet conditions, although one circumstance did show a significantly smaller inter-fish distance under noisy conditions.},

A resource to improve signal broadcast is the use of structures that favor the emission or the reception of sounds. We conducted playback experiments to assess the effect of the burrows occupied by the frogs Eupsophus emiliopugini and E. calcaratus on the amplitude of outgoing vocalizations. In addition, we evaluated the influence of these cavities on the reception of externally generated sounds potentially interfering with conspecific communication, namely, the vocalizations emitted by four syntopic species of anurans (E. emiliopugini, E. calcaratus, Batrachyla antartandica, and Pleurodema thaul) and the nocturnal owls Strix rufipes and Glaucidium nanum. Eupsophus advertisement calls emitted from within the burrows experienced average amplitude gains of 3–6 dB at 100 cm from the burrow openings. Likewise, the incoming vocalizations of amphibians and birds were amplified on average above 6 dB inside the cavities. The amplification of internally broadcast Eupsophus vocalizations favors signal detection by nearby conspecifics. Reciprocally, the amplification of incoming conspecific and heterospecific signals facilitates the detection of neighboring males and the monitoring of the levels of potentially interfering biotic noise by resident frogs, respectively.},

Models of pitch revealed predicted differences between infant- and adult-directed speech but did not provide evidence for cross-linguistic or longitudinal effects within the time period investigated for the three languages.

The listeners exhibited an intelligibility benefit in the predictable context relative to the other two semantic contexts, regardless of talker dialect. However, differences in intelligibility between the dialects were reduced in the unpredictable and anomalous contexts relative to the predictable context, suggesting greater online adaptation to dialect variation in the unpredictable and anomalous contexts than the predictable context. These results are consistent with the finding that dialect differences may be attenuated in production in low predictability contexts, and suggest that perceptual dialect adaptation is affected by fine‐grained intratalker acoustic variation.},

	abstract = {This article examines the contestation of a partially enregistered variety, namely, the “Cleveland accent” or “northern accent” in Ohio. Speaker perceptions of language variation within Ohio were collected from eighty-nine visitors to a science museum in Columbus, Ohio. Participant responses reflect Ohio’s complex dialect situation, dividing the northern and southern areas of the state out from a purportedly neutral, normative center. Accent-free speakers are positioned in central Ohio cities and presented as racially unmarked, while Southern, rural speakers and African American, young, urban speakers are presented as stigmatized and linguistically deficient Others. This stigma contrasts strikingly with the value-free discussion of otherwise unmarked speakers in northern Ohio, whose language differences, when noted, are presented less negatively, marked as less widely known, and, in some cases, downplayed as idiosyncratic variation. These results suggest that, for Ohio speakers, the North Midland/Inland North boundary is incompletely enregistered and would therefore be a promising site for the examination of enregisterment in progress and of the strategies speakers use to try to counter potential enregisterment.},

	abstract = {Campbell-Kibler (2012) argued that the “northern” or Cleveland accent has been developing as a register (Agha 2003, 2007) in Ohio, primarily positioned as an unstigmatized and idiosyncratic form of linguistic difference from an imagined central Ohio norm. The current study examines northern Ohioans’ orientation to this construct within a larger understanding of their sociolinguistic imagining of Ohio. Northerners are found to share many language ideologies with other Ohioans, including a focus on north-to-south variation, an emphasis on rural versus urban language difference, and a belief in the local existence of unaccented, educated, normative speech. They differ from other Ohioans in sometimes conceptualizing urban speech as standard, failing to mark central Ohio as a distinct region, and subdividing the northeast (their own region) in a Cleveland-centered small region and a larger northeast corner of the state., Most importantly, they differ from central Ohioans in their treatment of the linguistic difference between central and northern Ohio, i.e., the Inland North/Midland dialect boundary (Labov, Ash \& Boberg 2006). Forty-two percent of northerners and 52 percent of others fail to construct a perceptual boundary between central and northeast Ohio, while 27 percent and 48 percent respectively indicate the north as the divergent speech area. Northerners differ, however, in having a third group (31 percent), who position their own speech as normative and the central Ohio speech as marked, counter to the discourses of central Ohioans. These results support Agha’s (2007) point that individuals’ stakes in particular reflexive models are a key influence on models’ circulation and further show the importance of “unremarkable” as a context-bound and often valuable sociolinguistic meaning, rather than a lack of meaning.},

The procedures were compared on how effectively they (a) preserve phonemic information, (b) preserve information about the talker’s regional background (or sociolinguistic information), and (c) minimize anatomical/physiological variation in acoustic representations of vowels. Recordings were made for 80 female talkers and 80 male talkers of Dutch. These talkers were stratified according to their gender and regional background. The normalization procedures were applied to measurements of the fundamental frequency and the first three formant frequencies for a large set of vowel tokens. The normalization procedures were evaluated through statistical pattern analysis. The results show that normalization procedures that use information across multiple vowels (“vowel-extrinsic” information) to normalize a single vowel token performed better than those that include only information contained in the vowel token itself (“vowel-intrinsic” information). Furthermore, the results show that normalization procedures that operate on individual formants performed better than those that use information across multiple formants (e.g., “formant-extrinsic” F2-F1).F2-F1).{\textless}math altimg="eq-00001.gif" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mtext \textgreaterF2-F1).{\textless}/mtext \textgreater \textless/math \textgreater},

We conducted a systematic review that addresses these questions using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative review of behavioural, computational modelling, non-human animal, brain damage/disorder, electrical stimulation/recording, and neuroimaging research suggests that distributed brain regions involved in producing speech play specific, dynamic, and contextually determined roles in speech perception. The quantitative review employed region and network based neuroimaging meta-analyses and a novel text mining method to describe relative contributions of nodes in distributed brain networks. Supporting the qualitative review, results show a specific functional correspondence between regions involved in non-linguistic movement of the articulators, covertly and overtly producing speech, and the perception of both nonword and word sounds. This distributed set of cortical and subcortical speech production regions are ubiquitously active and form multiple networks whose topologies dynamically change with listening context. Results are inconsistent with motor and acoustic only models of speech perception and classical and contemporary dual-stream models of the organization of language and the brain. Instead, results are more consistent with complex network models in which multiple speech production related networks and subnetworks dynamically self-organize to constrain interpretation of indeterminant acoustic patterns as listening context requires.},

Shapes, orientations, and proximities of pairs of vowel distributions involved in phonological oppositions are modeled using best-fit ellipses (in F1 x F2 space) and ellipsoids (F1 x F2 x duration). Overlap fractions computed for each pair suggest that spectral and temporal features interact differently in the three varieties and oppositions. Under a two-dimensional analysis, two of three American English oppositions show no overlap; the third shows partial overlap. All Jamaican Creole oppositions exhibit complete overlap when F1 and F2 alone are modeled, but no or partial overlap with incorporation of a factor for duration. Jamaican English three-dimensional overlap fractions resemble two-dimensional results for American English. A multidimensional analysis tool such as SOAM appears to provide a more objective basis for simultaneously investigating spectral and temporal relations within vowel systems. Normalization methods and the SOAM method are described in an extended appendix.},

The present two-part experiment examined intraspeaker and interspeaker variability in speakers of Jamaican Creole and Jamaican English. IDS and Lombard speech showed similar adjustments in two parameters (F0 and intensity), and IDS and Citation speech showed the greatest spectral differences. This result is important because it shows that while one or two acoustic parameters may be crucial characteristics of a type of exaggerated speech, task production involved the systematic adjustment of a complex set of continuous acoustic parameters. Taken together, the acoustic outcomes for the types of perturbations investigated here allow the tasks to be arranged along a continuum. These adjustments resemble patterns associated with the manipulation of sociolinguistic markers reported in sociophonetic studies of “style-shifting.” We argue that the two phenomena may be treated under a unified account of intraspeaker variability that builds upon the sociolinguistic concept of Audience Design.},

Relative to unrelated auditory primes, matching real word primes facilitated lexical decision for visual real word targets, whereas competing minimal pair primes inhibited lexical decision. These effects were robust across two English vowel pairs (mid–front and low–front) and for two listener groups (mono-dialectal and multi-dialectal). However, both the most robust facilitation and the most robust inhibition were observed for the mid–front vowel words with few phonological competitors for the mono-dialectal listener group. The mid–front vowel targets were acoustically more distinct than the low–front vowel targets, suggesting that acoustic–phonetic similarity leads to stronger lexical competition and less robust facilitation and inhibition. The multi-dialectal listeners had more prior exposure to multiple different dialects than the mono-dialectal group, suggesting that long-term exposure to linguistic variability contributes to a more flexible processing strategy in which lexical competition extends over a longer period of time, leading to less robust facilitation and inhibition.},

However, the extent to which this important source of variation affects speech processing is largely unknown. In a series of four experiments, we examined the effects of dialect variation on speech intelligibility in noise and the effects of noise on perceptual dialect classification. Results revealed that, on the one hand, dialect-specific differences in speech intelligibility were more pronounced at harder signal-to-noise ratios, but were attenuated under more favorable listening conditions. Listener dialect did not interact with talker dialect; for all listeners, at a range of noise levels, the General American talkers were the most intelligible and the Mid-Atlantic talkers were the least intelligible. Dialect classification performance, on the other hand, was poor even with only moderate amounts of noise. These findings suggest that at moderate noise levels, listeners are able to adapt to dialect variation in the acoustic signal such that some cross-dialect intelligibility differences are neutralized, despite relatively poor explicit dialect classification performance. However, at more difficult noise levels, participants cannot effectively adapt to dialect variation in the acoustic signal and cross-dialect differences in intelligibility emerge for all listeners, regardless of their dialect.},

	abstract = {Dolphins are adept at learning new vocalizations (whistles) throughout life, an ability thus far demonstrated in few nonhuman mammals. In dolphins, this ability is well documented in captivity but poorly studied in the wild, and little is known of its role in natural social behavior. This study documents the previously unknown phenomenon of whistle convergence among habituated free-living male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.). Over a 4yr study period, three male subjects formed an alliance, spending most of their time together and cooperating to herd females. Within individuals, whistle repertoires were more variable than expected based on previous studies, mostly performed with captive dolphins, but became less so during the course of the study. Among individuals, the distinctiveness of individual repertoires decreased such that the three males were virtually indistinguishable by the end of the study. Initially, some whistle types were shared. By the end of the study, the three males had formed a close alliance, and had all converged on one particular shared whistle form which they had rarely produced before forming the alliance. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the prevailing ‘signature whistle’ hypothesis, as well as possible mechanisms and functional significance of whistle convergence among cooperating males.},

	abstract = {Currently, production and comprehension are regarded as quite distinct in accounts of language processing. In rejecting this dichotomy, we instead assert that producing and understanding are interwoven, and that this interweaving is what enables people to predict themselves and each other. We start by noting that production and comprehension are forms of action and action perception. We then consider the evidence for interweaving in action, action perception, and joint action, and explain such evidence in terms of prediction. Specifically, we assume that actors construct forward models of their actions before they execute those actions, and that perceivers of others' actions covertly imitate those actions, then construct forward models of those actions. We use these accounts of action, action perception, and joint action to develop accounts of production, comprehension, and interactive language. Importantly, they incorporate well-defined levels of linguistic representation (such as semantics, syntax, and phonology). We show (a) how speakers and comprehenders use covert imitation and forward modeling to make predictions at these levels of representation, (b) how they interweave production and comprehension processes, and (c) how they use these predictions to monitor the upcoming utterances. We show how these accounts explain a range of behavioral and neuroscientific data on language processing and discuss some of the implications of our proposal.},

	abstract = {One key aspect of face-to-face communication concerns the differences that may exist between speakers’ native regional accents. This paper focuses on the characterization of regional phonological variation in a conversational setting. A new, interactive task was designed in which 12 pairs of participants engaged in a collaborative game leading them to produce a number of purpose-built names. In each game, the participants were native speakers of Southern French and Northern French, respectively. How the names were produced by each of the two participants was automatically determined from the recordings using ASR techniques and a pre-established set of possible regional variants along five phonological dimensions. A naive Bayes classifier was then applied to these phonetic forms, with a view to differentiating the speakers’ native regional accents. The results showed that native regional accent was correctly recognized for 79\% of the speakers. These results also revealed or confirmed the existence of accent-dependent differences in how segments are phonetically realized, such as the affrication of /d/ in /di/ sequences. Our data allow us to better characterize the phonological and phonetic patterns associated with regional varieties of French on a large scale and in a natural, interactional situation.},

Perceptions of masculinity and sexual orientation represent a well-studied area on sociolinguistic perception, offering many variables with potentially relevant social meanings. This study examines social perceptions of guises created by intersecting three masculinity-relevant variables: pitch, /s/-fronting or backing, and (ING). First, 110 online respondents provided descriptions and naturalness ratings of speech samples that were digitially modified to include the different variants; next, 175 respondents rated the speakers on six-point scales based on the terms “smart,” “knowledgeable,” “masculine,” “gay,” “friendly,” “laid-back,” “country,” “educated,” and “confident.” The results showed that /s/-fronting carries strong social meaning across multiple speakers and other linguistic cues, making speakers sound less masculine, more gay and less competent. As documented elsewhere, use of the (ING) variants -ing and -in made speakers sound more or less competent, respectively. The combination of /s/-fronting and (ING), and, independently, /s/-backing, showed more complex effects, shifting relationships between multiple percepts. Taken together, these results provide some support for style-based sociolinguistic models, but also underline the need for more sophisticated statistical treatments of covariation in social perception.},

Indexical order is central to analyzing how semiotic agents access macro-sociological plane categories and concepts as values in the indexable realm of the micro-contextual. Through such access their relational identities are presupposed and creatively (trans)formed in interaction. We work through several classic examples of indexicality well-known in the literature of sociolinguistics, the clarification of which can be enhanced by using the concept of indexical order, viz., ‘T/V’ deference-indexicality, speech levels, indexically significant variation in phonetics informed by a standard phonological register. We conclude with an analysis of identity-commoditizing indexical overlays such as the American English register here dubbed “oinoglossia,” ‘wine talk’.},

The present study accounts for certain aspects of the dialect contact maintained between the standard Castilian Spanish and nonstandard varieties in Spain. This ongoing contact situation normally yields cases of, more often, dialect obsolescence together with standardization and leveling, on the one hand, or, conversely, and less often, survival processes of dialect maintenance, on the other. Particular attention is paid here to dialect attrition and revitalization with reference to innovative regional dialects in Spain, including, among others, Andalusian and Murcian varieties.},

This paper addresses the gap by investigating the stylistic use of falsetto phonation. Focusing on the speech of Heath, a speaker exhibiting considerable cross-situational variation, I show that when attending a barbecue with friends, Heath's falsetto is more frequent, longer, and characterized by higher fundamental frequency (f0) levels and wider f0 ranges. Advancing recent approaches to variation which treat linguistic features as stylistic resources for constructing social meaning, I draw on an analysis of the discourse contexts in which falsetto appears to illustrate that the feature carries expressive connotations. This meaning is employed to construct a ‘diva’ persona and may also participate in building a gay identity.},

This paper presents a reexamination of selected fundamental frequency and formant frequency data presented in their report for ten monophthongs by investigating sex-specific and developmental patterns using two different approaches. The first of these includes the investigation of age- and sex-specific formant frequency patterns in the monophthongs. The second, the investigation of fundamental frequency and formant frequency data using the critical band rate (bark) scale and a number of acoustic-phonetic dimensions of the monophthongs from an age- and sex-specific perspective. These acoustic-phonetic dimensions include: vowel spaces and distances from speaker centroids; frequency differences between the formant frequencies of males and females; vowel openness/closeness and frontness/backness; the degree of vocal effort; and formant frequency ranges. Both approaches reveal both age- and sex-specific development patterns which also appear to be dependent on whether vowels are peripheral or nonperipheral. The developmental emergence of these sex-specific differences are discussed with reference to anatomical, physiological, sociophonetic, and culturally determined factors. Some directions for further investigation into the age-linked sex differences in speech across the lifespan are also proposed.},

Focus was on the phonetic variants used for (t) in word-medial and word-final prevocalic contexts since it is known that these variants display clear sociolinguistic patterning in the adult community. Variant usage in CDS was found to differ markedly from that in interadult speech. Effects were also found with respect to the age and gender of the children being addressed. Speech to girls generally contained more standard variants than speech to boys, which, by contrast, contained higher rates of vernacular variants. The differentiation by gender was most apparent for the youngest children. The findings are assessed in comparison to other studies of CDS. It has previously been claimed that modifications made in the CDS register help children to learn linguistic structures and also to learn that speech is a social activity. Our findings suggest that CDS may play an additional role, providing boys and girls as young as 2;0 with differential opportunities to learn the social-indexical values of sociolinguistic variables.},

The second wave employed ethnographic methods to explore the local categories and configurations that inhabit, or constitute, these broader categories. In both waves, variation was seen as marking social categories. This article sets out a theoretical foundation for the third wave, arguing that (a) variation constitutes a robust social semiotic system, potentially expressing the full range of social concerns in a given community; (b) the meanings of variables are underspecified, gaining more specific meanings in the context of styles, and (c) variation does not simply reflect, but also constructs, social meaning and hence is a force in social change.},

The spatial boundaries of /l/-vocalization in Swiss German are suspected to have been expanding since being described in the Linguistic Atlas of German-Speaking Switzerland in the middle of the 20th century. The present study assesses the overall expansion of /l/-vocalization by means of a rapid anonymous survey in 20 urban regional centers situated just beyond the traditional boundaries of /l/-vocalization highlighted by the Atlas. Results show that the expansion of /l/-vocalization mainly progresses in southeasterly, southerly, and westerly directions, but with much less success to the north and northwest, where the equally influential dialectal areas of Basel and Zürich seem to exert opposing influences. Further analysis of the data indicates that somewhat differing constraint hierarchies are at work in the different places to which vocalization has diffused.},

This makes sense – given that even casual observation tells us that humans behave differently at different points in the life cycle, it is quite reasonable to take age into account when investigating human behavior. In turn, the use of age as a variable has led to a wide range of methods and analytical tools that rely on the use of age (e.g., the apparent time construct in sociolinguistics). However, it turns out that even though age is often treated in a rather simple way, it is actually a complicated concept that can be difficult to pin down precisely and that the usual linguistic view of age as a simple reflection of the linear passage of time is lacking. That fact has repercussions for how linguists should deal with age, including not just issues like how to record metadata relating to it, but even methodological concerns such as how to do the initial elicitation in the first place.},

I review research on the linguistic perception and production of gender and sexuality that has adopted an intersectional perspective to date and argue that while certain aspects of the theory have long had a foothold in work in this area, the field's engagement with the full ramifications of intersectionality as an analytical framework has been partial. I conclude with suggestions about how to anchor a more comprehensive approach to intersectionality in sociolinguistic research.},

Two central questions in the study of language contact and change are (1) whether social or linguistic factors are primary in predicting the outcomes of contact; and (2) whether change in the context of contact is a foregone conclusion. Quantitative studies of sociolinguistic variation provide an effective means of observing change in progress, but the majority of such studies have focused on monolingual speakers/communities. This article gives a brief summary of the study of language contact in variationist sociolinguistics before turning to a discussion of the types of data and approaches best suited to answering the question of how and when contact causes change in multilingual communities. Recognizing that the description of a multilingual community involves more social parameters and more inter-individual variation than a monolingual one, this article focuses on a core list of social factors to consider in studies of variation and change in multilingual communities, organized so that possible intersections may also be considered.},

While early stratificational models formulated on the basis of socioeconomic indicators such as income, occupation, and area of residence revealed compelling patterns of linguistic variation, they were critiqued for their lack of explanatory power at the interactional level and for their marginalization of those without paid employment. Subsequent models have employed cross-disciplinary concepts such as the linguistic market, social networks, and communities of practice, prioritizing local social distinctions that are understood to reflect or even constitute abstract structural categories such as ‘working class’ or ‘middle class’. It is argued that a full socioeconomic class paradigm for sociolinguistics would also theorize class at the aggregate level, and to this end, sociological class models may prove useful. Contemporary sociological class analysis at the level of social practice offers additional avenues for interfacing with sociology.},

With this end in mind, we suggest some brief, quantitative indices that might be appropriate and useful for documenting social psychological variables for contemporary and future purposes. The first construct considered is ethnolinguistic vitality, which refers to those characteristics that make a language group likely to behave as an active collective entity in language contact situations. The second is language attitudes, which refer to the feelings and beliefs that people hold with regard to their own and others' languages and the associated language community/ies. The third is ethnolinguistic identity, which refers to the manner and extent to which individuals define themselves as members of an ethnolinguistic group. Although we maintain that more extensive, detailed coding should be included in sociolinguistic archives, we suggest that these three sets of indices should be minimally included in a battery to assess a speaker's ethnolinguistic orientation.},

This study examines the production of released /t/ by six prominent U.S. political figures, as well as the social meanings listeners attribute to the variant. Employing a matched guise technique facilitated by digital stimulus manipulation, we find that the social meanings associated with released /t/ are constrained by linguistic and social factors. Regarding the former, word-medial /t/ releases carry stronger social meanings than those appearing word-finally. With respect to social factors, listener interpretations vary according to the identity of the speaker and knowledge of how frequently particular speakers produce /t/ releases. Thus, even though conventionalized associations between linguistic forms and meanings can be drawn upon to construct articulate personas, not all speakers can do so with equal effectiveness.},

The findings of this research support the hypothesis according to which retention of syllable-final /r/ is perceived as a prestigious variant in Venezuelan Spanish. However, our findings do not show a strong attitudinal evaluation in favor oïlàl retention. These results provide a contribution to the study of language attitudes using a perceptual task, a practice that is not very commonly used to assess a linguistic variable.

	abstract = {This study was an investigation of the impact of language stigma for identity functioning among speakers of Andalusian Spanish. Fifteen Andalusian Spaniards were interviewed using a semistructured interview schedule. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyze the data guided by identity process theory and the ethnolinguistic vitality framework. The following themes are outlined: (a) threatened linguistic identity and vitality (re)constructions; (b) relocating the sociopsychological value in one's linguistic variety; and (c) multiple linguistic identities: threat and management. This article elucidates how perceived threats to ethnolinguistic vitality can induce identity threat. Weak social status may jeopardize self-esteem, while weak institutional support may threaten self-efficacy. The belonging principle may be vulnerable to threat in contexts in which the stigmatized group has minority status. Relevant sociolinguistic concepts are discussed in relation to the intrapsychic level of identity functioning. Potential strategies for coping are discussed.},

Since achieving political autonomy within Spain in 1979, Catalonia has instituted a number of policies, particularly in education, to enhance the status and use of Catalan. A matched guise test was conducted among students in Barcelona in 1980 and again in 1987 to gauge changes in attitudes toward Catalan and Castilian. Conflict between positive status and negative solidarity values of Catalan for nonnative speakers found in 1980 appears to be resolved in 1987. Three aspects of public language policy have attenuated ethnic constraints against nonnative use of Catalan, but further changes in social relations may be necessary to alter patterns of language choice.},

	abstract = {In a world where most individuals speak more than one language and most languages are in contact with other languages, the study of language in its social context must take into account language contact. Two central questions in the study of language contact and change are (1) whether social or linguistic factors are primary in predicting the outcomes of contact; and (2) whether change in the context of contact is a foregone conclusion. Quantitative studies of sociolinguistic variation provide an effective means of observing change in progress, but the majority of such studies have focused on monolingual speakers/communities. This article gives a brief summary of the study of language contact in variationist sociolinguistics before turning to a discussion of the types of data and approaches best suited to answering the question of how and when contact causes change in multilingual communities. Recognizing that the description of a multilingual community involves more social parameters and more inter-individual variation than a monolingual one, this article focuses on a core list of social factors to consider in studies of variation and change in multilingual communities, organized so that possible intersections may also be considered.},

	abstract = {The linguistic map of Amazonia presents a startling jumble of languages and language families. While some families – most notably Carib, Arawak, Macro-Jê, and Tupí– are distributed widely throughout the region, their spread is interspersed with many dozens of tiny, localized families and language isolates, particularly in the Amazonian periphery. At the same time, distributions of lexical, grammatical, and phonological features suggest that this linguistic patchwork is overlaid in places by contact regions, where multilingualism has fostered lexical and/or structural resemblances among languages. This complex distribution of languages and linguistic features presents many challenges to our understanding of Amazonian prehistory. How did Amazonia's language families arrive at their present distribution? Why did some families spread over huge distances, while others came to occupy only tiny geographical pockets or are limited to a single language? What kinds of interactions among peoples led to the formation of contact zones, and how are these regions defined? Complicating these questions further is the fact that very little is known about many Amazonian languages, and relationships among them are in many cases a matter of conjecture. This article surveys our current understanding of language classification and language contact in Amazonia, and addresses various perspectives concerning the implications of these relationships for Amazonian prehistory.},

	abstract = {Studying dialectal contact offers linguists an opportunity to critically examine some of our most basic assumptions about language. In particular, careful consideration of geographically constrained patterns of linguistic variation highlights the limitations of named language varieties as tools for linguistic inquiry. Ultimately, the locus of contact is not to be found in the interaction of such abstractions, but rather in the individual minds of those who live in contact communities. The present paper highlights these issues through a discussion of Spanish dialectal contact in the U.S., with a special emphasis on the variable social salience of regionally differentiated features. Work reviewed here is consistent with previous research that finds the relative salience of features to be a key determinant of their trajectory in situations of contact. Change in the use of high salience features is likely to be the result of direct accommodation between speakers, while change in low salience features is likely to arise by other, indirect mechanisms. The role of salience in shaping the outcomes of contact reinforces its inherently social nature, reminding us that what we hope to understand are not the results of dialects in contact, but rather, those of people in contact.},

With this end in mind, we suggest some brief, quantitative indices that might be appropriate and useful for documenting social psychological variables for contemporary and future purposes. The first construct considered is ethnolinguistic vitality, which refers to those characteristics that make a language group likely to behave as an active collective entity in language contact situations. The second is language attitudes, which refer to the feelings and beliefs that people hold with regard to their own and others' languages and the associated language community/ies. The third is ethnolinguistic identity, which refers to the manner and extent to which individuals define themselves as members of an ethnolinguistic group. Although we maintain that more extensive, detailed coding should be included in sociolinguistic archives, we suggest that these three sets of indices should be minimally included in a battery to assess a speaker's ethnolinguistic orientation.},

	abstract = {Since the 1960s, Western Europe has been host to a large Turkish immigrant community. While many such communities shift to the majority language in the space of a few generations, language maintenance is remarkably successful in this community. This is partially because of continuing immigration, but it is also typical of a transnational identity that characterizes many bilingual communities in modern Europe. The linguistic effects of this on-going contact situation include extensive codeswitching and slowly emerging changes in the lexicon and syntax. These are contained in a range of speech styles that show that in such modern migrant communities, the way in which different subgroups utilize their multilingual repertoire varies considerably, depending on background factors such as gender, locality, age, and socio-political identity.},

	abstract = {A speaker produced schwa-CV disyllables in which consonants were low or high in coarticulation resistance. Articulatory and acoustic measurements verified that the magnitude, but not the extent, of anticipatory coarticulation from the stressed vowel to the schwa was modulated by coarticulation resistance. In a perception experiment, listeners heard schwa-CV disyllables that ended in stressed /i/ or /a/ and made speeded identifications of the stressed vowels. Some disyllables had been cross-spliced so that a schwa vowel that had originally been produced in the context of C/i/ was spliced onto a C/a/ syllable or vice versa. Other disyllables were spliced so that a schwa originally from a C/i/ (or C/a/) context was spliced onto a different C/i/ (C/a/) token. Listeners’ response latencies were slower to cross spliced than to spliced disyllables but only in the context of low rather than high resistant consonants. The outcome is generally consistent with a hypothesis that listeners to speech “parse” the acoustic signal along coarticulatory or phonetic gestural lines and that success in parsing varies with the amount of acoustic evidence talkers provide. However, findings did not suggest “perfect” parsing. Correlations between the amount of acoustic information provided by the speaker and the extent to which listeners were disrupted by cross splicing were nonsignificant.},

Explanations for phonetic reduction of predictable forms tend to take one of two approaches: Intelligibility-based accounts hold that talkers maximize intelligibility of words that might otherwise be difficult to recognize; production-based accounts hold that variation reflects the speed of lexical access and retrieval in the language production system. Here we examine phonetic variation as a function of phonological neighborhood density, capitalizing on the fact that words from dense phonological neighborhoods tend to be relatively difficult to recognize, yet easy to produce. We show that words with many phonological neighbors tend to be phonetically reduced (shortened in duration and produced with more centralized vowels) in connected speech, when other predictors of phonetic variation are brought under statistical control. We argue that our findings are consistent with the predictions of production-based accounts of pronunciation variation.},

Instead, another mechanism might explain these results. Recent studies found that when a request was preceded by engaging a participant in dialogue (defined as a short conversation), the participant was more willing to fulfill the request. Thus, verbal mimicry might be perceived in the same way as dialogue. If this is the case, a theoretical confound would be revealed. To test whether the mechanisms are different of the same, two field studies were conducted using a 2 (dialogue: yes/no) × 2 (mimicry: yes/no) design. The study results revealed two main effects and no interaction effects, which means that verbal mimicry and dialogue are two distinct mechanisms. Interestingly, additive effects for these mechanisms were found.},

The current study was designed to explore prosodic variation in read speech in two regional varieties of American English: Southern and Midland. Prosodic dialect variation was analyzed in two domains: speaking rate and the phonetic expression of pitch movements associated with accented and phrase-final syllables. The results revealed significant effects of regional dialect on the distributions of pauses, pitch accents, and phrasal-boundary tone combinations. Significant effects of talker gender were also observed on the distributions of pitch accents and phrasal-boundary tone combinations. The findings from this study demonstrate that regional and gender identity features are encoded in part through prosody, and provide further motivation for the close examination of prosodic patterns across regional and social varieties of American English.},

The study further examines whether regional dialects form different groupings based on their segmental vs. global temporal characteristics. Acoustic measures included articulation rate, pause frequency and duration, and vowel and consonant duration variability. The results revealed that Southern American English is characterized by a slow overall articulation rate, long pauses, and highly variable syllable-to-syllable vowel durations, whereas the New England dialect is characterized by a fast overall articulation rate, short pauses, and highly variable syllable-to-syllable consonant durations. The patterns for the other dialects are more mixed: the Northern and Western dialects are characterized by low variability vowel durations, the Midland dialect shares a slow articulation rate with the Southern dialect, and the Mid-Atlantic dialect exhibits no unique temporal properties among those examined. Thus, temporal variation in regional dialects of American English is orthogonal to vowel variation, in which New England, Midland, and Western dialects are often characterized together as “General American”. Taken together, the results are consistent with the stereotype that Southerners talk slowly and Northerners talk quickly and suggest that pausing and segmental duration variability may contribute to the perceived speaking rate differences.},

The combination of these measures reflects the deletion of phones, which is related to speaking style. The effect of the two rate measures on the perceived speech rate is compared in two listening experiments on the basis of a set of intonation phrases with carefully balanced intended and realized phone rates, selected from a German database of spontaneous speech. Because the balance between input-oriented (effort) and output-oriented (communicative) constraints may be different at fast versus slow speech rates, the effect of articulation rate is compared both for fast and for slow phrases from the database. The effect of the listeners’ own speaking habits is also investigated to evaluate if listeners’ perception is based on a projection of their own behavior as a speaker. It is shown that listener judgments reflect both the intended and realized phone rates, and that their judgments are independent of the constraint balance and their own speaking habits.},

Previous results suggest that listeners are highly sensitive to whether a talker is a native or nonnative speaker of the language. Listeners also have some ability to categorize or classify talkers by regional dialect or nonnative accent. However, most previous studies have included variability in only one of these categories (many nonnative accents or many regional dialects). The present study simultaneously examined listeners’ perceptual organization of regional dialects and nonnative accents. Talkers representing six United States regional dialects, six international native dialects, and twelve nonnative accents were included in two tasks: an auditory free classification task—in which listeners grouped talkers based on perceived region of origin—and ladder task—in which listeners arranged talkers based on their perceived distance from standard American English. Listeners were sensitive to the distinction between native and nonnative accents, even when presented with a very wide range of dialects and accents. Further, subgroups within the native and nonnative clusters in the free classification task suggested several organizing factors, including perceived distance from the local standard, specific acoustic-phonetic talker characteristics, and speaking rate.},

The present study attempts to extend understanding of non-linguists’ perceptions of linguistic diversity through the investigation of how accurately and consistently UK-born students, resident in the north-east of England, can identify the speaker place of origin of six forms of L1 and L2 English. The results demonstrate that whilst the process of encoding indexical properties to and categorisations of speech stimulus as belonging to a specific language variety is complex, there is a clear tendency amongst informants to initially identify the speech as either native or non-native, most especially through the perception of specific segmental and non-segmental phonological features, before attempting more fine-grained classifications. The findings also point to the recognition of speaker place of origin at different levels of awareness, above and below the level of individual consciousness.},

	abstract = {This study used a multi-talker database containing intelligibility scores for 2000 sentences (20 talkers, 100 sentences), to identify talker-related correlates of speech intelligibility. We first investigated “global” talker characteristics (e.g., gender, F0 and speaking rate). Findings showed female talkers to be more intelligible as a group than male talkers. Additionally, we found a tendency for F0 range to correlate positively with higher speech intelligibility scores. However, F0 mean and speaking rate did not correlate with intelligibility. We then examined several fine-grained acoustic-phonetic talker-characteristics as correlates of overall intelligibility. We found that talkers with larger vowel spaces were generally more intelligible than talkers with reduced spaces. In investigating two cases of consistent listener errors (segment deletion and syllable affiliation), we found that these perceptual errors could be traced directly to detailed timing characteristics in the speech signal. Results suggest that a substantial portion of variability in normal speech intelligibility is traceable to specific acoustic-phonetic characteristics of the talker. Knowledge about these factors may be valuable for improving speech synthesis and recognition strategies, and for special populations (e.g., the hearing-impaired and second-language learners) who are particularly sensitive to intelligibility differences among talkers.
Auf der Grundlage eines Multi-Sprecher Datenkorpus mit den Verständlichkeitsbewertungen von 2000 Sätzen (20 Sprecher, 100 Sätze) wurden in dieser Studie die sprecherspezifischen Korrelate der Sprach Verständlichkeit untersucht. Zunächst wurden “globale” Sprechercharakteristika untersucht (z.B. Geschlecht, F0 und Sprechgeschwindigkeit). Die Resultate zeigen an, daβ weibliche Sprecher als Gesamtgruppe besser verstanden werden als männliche. Weiterhin wurde als Tendenz ermittelt, daβ die F0-Variationsbreite positiv mit erhöhten Verständlichkeitswerten korreliert. Allerdings korreliert die Sprachverständlichkeit nicht mit dem F0-Mittelwert oder der Sprechgeschwindigkeit. Anschlieβend wurden verschiedene detailphonetische akustische Sprechercharakteristika als Korrelate der Sprachverständlichkeit untersucht. Es wurde fest-gestellt, daβ Sprecher mit erweitertem Vokalraum im allgemeinen besser verstanden werden als Sprecher mit reduziertem Vokalraum. Unter genauerer Betrachtung zweier Fälle konsistenter Wahrnehmungsfehler (Tilgung und Silbenzuordnung von Segmenten) konnte festgestellt werden, daβ sich die Wahrnehmungsfehler direkt auf detaillierte Ausprägungen des Timing im Sprachsignal zurückführen lassen. Die Resultate weisen darauf hin, daβ sich ein Groβteil der Variabilität in der Sprachverständlichkeit auf akustisch-phonetische Charakteristika der jeweiligen Sprecher zurückführen lassen. Eine genaue Erkenntnis dieser Faktoren ist von Nutzen für Verfahren der Sprachsynthese und Spracherkenung, sowie für solche Populationen (z.B. bei Hörbehinderungen oder im Zweitspracherwerb), die besonders sensibel auf Unterschiede in der Verständlichkeit verschiedener Sprecher reagieren.
Dans cette étude, on a utilisé une base de données multi-locuteurs contenant des scores d'intelligibilité de 2000 phrases (20 locuteurs, 100 phrases) pour identifier les corrélats de l'intelligibilité qui sont dépendants du locuteur. Nous avons d'abord étudié des caractéristiques “globales” des locuteurs (genre, F0 et vitesse d'élocution). Il est apparu que les locutrices sont globalement plus intelligibles que les locuteurs. Nous avons également observé que l'ampleur du registre de F0 avait tendance à être corrélée positivement avec des scores d'intelligibilité plus élevés. Toutefois, la valeur moyenne de F0 et la vitesse d'élocution ne semblent pas être corrélées avec l'intelligibilité. Nous avons ensuite examiné d'autres corrélats de l'intelligibilité globale, plus fins au niveau des caractéristiques acoustico-phonétiques du locuteur. Nous avons observé que les locuteurs présentant des triangles vocaliques larges étaient généralement plus intelligibles que les locuteurs présentant des triangles vocaliques serrés. En étudiant deux cas d'erreurs d'écoute consistantes (destruction d'un segment et attribution à une syllabe), nous avons trouvé que ces erreurs perceptives pouvaient être dérivées directement des caractéristiques de timing détaillées du signal de parole. Les résultats suggèrent qu'une part substantielle de la variabilité de l'intelligibilité de la parole normale est attribuable aux caractéristiques acoustico-phonétiques spécifiques du locuteur. La connaissance de ces facteurs peut être utile pour améliorer la synthèse de la parole et les stratégies de reconnaissance, et pour des populations spécifiques (comme par exemple, les mal-entendants ou ceux qui apprennent une langue étrangère) qui sont particulièrement sensibles aux écarts d'intelligilibité entre locuteurs.},

Local, R. Ogden \& R. Temple (Eds.), Papers in laboratory phonology, Vol. VI (pp. 26–50)) reported that vowel dispersion, i.e. distance from the center of the talker's F1/F2 space, was greater in words that represented difficult recognition targets (‘hard’ words) than in easy recognition targets (‘easy’ words). The goal of the current study was to test whether that effect persisted when controlling for known other determinants of F1 and F2. A second goal was to test whether the pattern observed in the recordings analysed in Wright (2004) extended to all monophthongs in the set of recordings of which the words analysed in Wright (2004) formed a subset. We find that the dispersion difference between ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ words vowel dispersion is expected, given previous observations about effects of phonetic environment on vowel formants. When segmental context is taken into account, recognition difficulty fails to be predictive of vowel dispersion, both in the subset and in the larger database. An analysis of the fitted values of models of F1 and F2 based on consonantal factors (but not recognition difficulty) shows that the formant values predicted by those models separate vowels in “easy” and “hard” words in the manner observed in W2004. We discuss the implications for the effect of phonological neighbourhood density on language production, and for the relationship between lexical retrieval, auditory recognition difficulty and pronunciation variation.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem for understanding the evolution of human language has been the lack of significant parallels among nonhuman primates. Most researchers have focused on vocal plasticity—that is, the ability to learn novel sounds or modify call structure in response to social or environmental variables. Although songbirds, whales, dolphins, and some other mammals have this ability, nonhuman primates have appeared not to have it (1). Other studies found that nonhuman primates do not have a vocal tract that would allow them to produce the sounds of human speech (2) and that primates cannot take turns, a critical aspect of human conversation (3). All three points have been challenged by recent research (see the table), suggesting that nonhuman primates may after all be valuable models for understanding the evolution of speech and language.

	abstract = {Trying to uncover the roots of human speech and language has been the premier motivation to study the signalling behaviour of nonhuman primates for several decades. Focussing on the question of whether we find evidence for linguistic reference in the production of nonhuman primate vocalizations, I will first discuss how the criteria used to diagnose referential signalling have changed over time, and will then turn to the paradigmatic case of semantic communication in animals, the alarm calls of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus. A recent in-depth analysis of the original material revealed that, while the alarm calls could be well distinguished, calls of similar structure were also used in within- and between-group aggression. This finding is difficult to reconcile with the idea that calls denote objects in the environment. Furthermore, nonhuman primates show only minimal signs of vocal production learning, one key prerequisite for conventionalized and symbolic communication. In addition, the structure of calls in different populations or closely related species is highly conserved. In conclusion, any continuity between nonhuman primate and human communication appears to be found at the level of the processing of signals. Why and how the ancestors of our own species one day began to talk to each other continues to be an enigma. Future research should focus on changes in the neural structure supporting volitional control over vocalizations, the gene networks associated with vocal production, and the developmental processes involved in the integration of production and perception of vocalizations.},

	abstract = {The linguistic diversity enduring beyond institutional pressures and social prejudices against nonstandard dialects questions the social forces influencing language maintenance across generations and how children contribute to this process. Children encounter multi-dialectal interactions in their early environment, and increasing evidence shows that the acquisition of sociolinguistic variation is not a side issue but an inherent part of the general acquisition process. Despite these recent advances in sociolinguistic acquisition, children’s sociolinguistic uses remain under-studied in relation to peer social networks and the ability to use dialect for identity purposes. Our study focused on a grammatical sociolinguistic variable consisting of the alternation between a regional and a standard variant of the third person object pronoun in French. The regional variant is a remnant of the Francoprovençal language and its usage by adults is strongly associated with local identity in the French Alps. We described, using questionnaires, the social networks of 117 10-11 year-old girls and boys living in the same restricted rural area. Thirteen native target children (7 girls and 6 boys) were selected from the sample, as well as 39 same-sex friends chosen according to their place of birth (native vs non-native) and the duration of their friendship with the targets (number of years they have known each other). The target children were recorded during spontaneous dyadic conversations during free play at school with each category of friends. Target boys, but not girls, used the regional variant significantly more frequently with their long-term native friends than with their non-native friends. This adjustment mirrored their partners’ uses. Moreover, with long-term native friends, boys used the regional variant twice as frequently as girls. Boys appeared thus as key actors in the maintenance and the diffusion of regional cues in local social networks.},

	abstract = {Research in speakers of closely related varieties has shown that bilectalism and non-standardization affect speakers’ perception of the variants that exist in their native languages in a way that is absent from the performance of their monolingual peers. One possible explanation for this difference is that non-standardization blurs the boundaries of grammatical variants and increases grammatical fluidity. Affected by such factors, bilectals become less accurate in identifying the variety to which a grammatical variant pertains. Another explanation is that their differential performance derives from the fact that they are competent in two varieties. Under this scenario, the difference is due to the existence of two linguistic systems in the course of development, and not to how close or standardized these systems are. This study employs a novel variety-judgment task in order to elucidate which of the two explanations holds. Having administered the task to monolinguals, bilectals, and bilinguals, including heritage language learners and L1 attriters, we obtained a dataset of 16,245 sentences. The analysis shows differential performance between bilectal and bilingual speakers, granting support for the first explanation. We discuss the role of factors such as non-standardization and linguistic proximity in language development and flesh out the implications of the results in relation to different developmental trajectories.},

	abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests that unfamiliar languages sound faster than one’s native language. Empirical evidence for this impression has, so far, come from explicit rate judgments. The aim of the present study was to test whether such perceived rate differences between native and foreign languages have effects on implicit speech processing. Our measure of implicit rate perception was “normalization for speaking rate”: an ambiguous vowel between short /a/ and long /a:/ is interpreted as /a:/ following a fast but as /a/ following a slow carrier sentence. That is, listeners did not judge speech rate itself; instead, they categorized ambiguous vowels whose perception was implicitly affected by the rate of the context. We asked whether a bias towards long /a:/ might be observed when the context is not actually faster but simply spoken in a foreign language. A fully symmetrical experimental design was used: Dutch and German participants listened to rate matched (fast and slow) sentences in both languages spoken by the same bilingual speaker. Sentences were followed by nonwords that contained vowels from an /a-a:/ duration continuum. Results from Experiments 1 and 2 showed a consistent effect of rate normalization for both listener groups. Moreover, for German listeners, across the two experiments, foreign sentences triggered more /a:/ responses than (rate matched) native sentences, suggesting that foreign sentences were indeed perceived as faster. Moreover, this Foreign Language effect was modulated by participants’ ability to understand the foreign language: those participants that scored higher on a foreign language translation task showed less of a Foreign Language effect. However, opposite effects were found for the Dutch listeners. For them, their native rather than the foreign language induced more /a:/ responses. Nevertheless, this reversed effect could be reduced when additional spectral properties of the context were controlled for. Experiment 3, using explicit rate judgments, replicated the effect for German but not Dutch listeners. We therefore conclude that the subjective impression that foreign languages sound fast may have an effect on implicit speech processing, with implications for how language learners perceive spoken segments in a foreign language.},

	abstract = {Despite the ubiquity of between-talker differences in accent and dialect, little is known about how listeners adjust to this source of variability as language is perceived in real time. In three experiments, we examined whether, and when, listeners can use specific knowledge of a particular talker's accent during on-line speech processing. Listeners were exposed to the speech of two talkers, a male who had an unfamiliar regional dialect of American English, in which the /æ/ vowel is raised to /ei/ only before /g/ (e.g., bag is pronounced /beig/), and a female talker without the dialect. In order to examine how knowledge of a particular talker's accent influenced language processing, we examined listeners' interpretation of unaccented words such as back and bake in contexts that included a competitor like bag. If interpretation processes are talker-specific, the pattern of competition from bag should vary depending on how that talker pronounces the competitor word. In all three experiments, listeners rapidly used their knowledge of how the talker would have pronounced bag to either rule out or include bag as a temporary competitor. Providing a cue to talker identity prior to the critical word strengthened these effects. These results are consistent with views of language processing in which multiple sources of information, including previous experience with the current talker and contextual cues, are rapidly integrated during lexical activation and selection processes.},

The results suggest that the more similar the listener's dialect is to Utah English, the better his or her ability to identify Utah speakers. Moreover, it was found that listeners from Utah use less stereotypical characteristics of Utah English for identifying Utahns from non-Utahns; those from the Western United States and other locations use more. This study demonstrates that listeners with more experience with Utah English are better able to identify Utah speakers than those with less experience. These findings are also examined in light of stereotypical perceptions of both Utah English and the phonetic characteristics examined in this study.},

In an empirical section, the results of a linguistic experiment are presented. This investigates the recognizability of a speaker's dialectal origins on the basis of their spoken Swiss Standard German. The experiment also explores the participants' self-assessment of their own competence in the localization task. Finally, participants' reports of the factors they believed had led them to their conclusions about the speakers' dialects form the basis of a discussion of the salience of various features in spoken Swiss Standard German.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have found that naïve listeners perform poorly in forced-choice dialect categorization tasks. However, the listeners' error patterns in these tasks reveal systematic confusions between phonologically similar dialects. In the present study, a free classification procedure was used to measure the perceptual similarity structure of regional dialect variation in the United States. In two experiments, participants listened to a set of short English sentences produced by male talkers only (Experiment 1) and by male and female talkers (Experiment 2). The listeners were instructed to group the talkers by regional dialect into as many groups as they wanted with as many talkers in each group as they wished. Multidimensional scaling analyses of the data revealed three primary dimensions of perceptual similarity (linguistic markedness, geography, and gender). In addition, a comparison of the results obtained from the free classification task to previous results using the same stimulus materials in six-alternative forced-choice categorization tasks revealed that response biases in the six-alternative task were reduced or eliminated in the free classification task. Thus, the results obtained with the free classification task in the current study provided further evidence that the underlying structure of perceptual dialect category representations reflects important linguistic and sociolinguistic factors.},

However, the effects of sociocultural experiences on person perception abilities in other identity-conveying modalities like audition have not been explored. Investigating an own-race bias in the auditory domain provides a unique opportunity for studying whether person identification is a modality-independent construct and how it is sensitive to asymmetric cultural experiences. Here we show that an own-race bias in talker identification arises from asymmetric experience with different spoken dialects. When listeners categorized voices by race (White or Black), a subset of the Black voices were categorized as sounding White, while the opposite case was unattested. Acoustic analyses indicated listeners’ perceptions about race were consistent with differences in specific phonetic and phonological features. In a subsequent person-identification experiment, the Black voices initially categorized as sounding White elicited an own-race bias from White listeners, but not from Black listeners. These effects are inconsistent with person-perception models that strictly analogize faces and voices based on recognition from only structural features. Our results demonstrate that asymmetric exposure to spoken dialect, independent from talkers’ physical characteristics, affects auditory perceptual expertise for talker identification. Person perception thus additionally relies on socioculturally-acquired dynamic information, which may be represented by different mechanisms in different sensory modalities.},

We first discuss bottom-up processes in person construal based on visual features (e.g., facial prototypicality and bodily cues), and then discuss how top-down factors (e.g., beliefs, stereotypes) may influence these processes. Next, we examine how the initial categorization of targets as ingroup or outgroup members influences identification, stereotyping, and group-based evaluations, and the relations between these constructs. We also explore the implications of the activation of these constructs for a range of social judgments including emotion identification, empathy, and intergroup behaviors. Finally, we describe a variety of well established and more recent strategies to reduce intergroup bias that target the activation of category-based knowledge, including intergroup contact, approach orientations, evaluative conditioning, and perspective taking.},

In the present study we introduce a new paradigm that enables the crowdsourcing of acoustic features through smartphone devices. We used Dialäkt Äpp, a free iOS app that allows users to record themselves, to crowdsource audio data. Nearly 3,000 speakers from 452 localities in German-speaking Switzerland provided recordings; we measured articulation rates for these speakers using a metric based on duration intervals between consecutive vowel onsets. Results revealed distinct regional differences in articulation rate between major dialect regions and individual localities. The specification of 452 localities enabled analyses at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Results further revealed a robust effect of gender, with women articulating significantly more slowly than men. Both the geographical patterns and the effect of gender found in this study corroborate similar findings on Swiss German previously reported in a very limited set of localities, thus verifying the validity of the crowdsourcing framework. Given the application of this new framework, a large bulk of the discussion is devoted to discussing methodological caveats.},

The second type we term top–down, and use it to refer to the way our cultural upbringing broadly shapes how we think, which may in turn have an impact on how we perceive the world.

	abstract = {Accents provide information about the speaker's geographical, socio-economic, and ethnic background. Research in applied psychology and sociolinguistics suggests that we generally prefer our own accent to other varieties of our native language and attribute more positive traits to it. Despite the widespread influence of accents on social interactions, educational and work settings the neural underpinnings of this social bias toward our own accent and, what may drive this bias, are unexplored. We measured brain activity while participants from two different geographical backgrounds listened passively to 3 English accent types embedded in an adaptation design. Cerebral activity in several regions, including bilateral amygdalae, revealed a significant interaction between the participants' own accent and the accent they listened to: while repetition of own accents elicited an enhanced neural response, repetition of the other group's accent resulted in reduced responses classically associated with adaptation. Our findings suggest that increased social relevance of, or greater emotional sensitivity to in-group accents, may underlie the own-accent bias. Our results provide a neural marker for the bias associated with accents, and show, for the first time, that the neural response to speech is partly shaped by the geographical background of the listener.},

	abstract = {Phonological representations capture information about individual word forms and about the general characteristics of word forms in a language. To support the processing of novel word forms as well as familiar word forms in novel contexts, an abstract level of representation is needed in which many phonetic details and contextual features are disregarded. At the same time, evidence has accumulated that such details are retained in memory and used in processing individual words and indexical features of language. Taken together, these results mean that a hybrid model of phonological representation is needed. The abstract level supports generalizations based on lexical type statistics and fast adaptation to communicative requirements through the reuse of existing categories. A richly detailed level of representation is implicated in word-specific phonetic patterns, the detailed dynamics of regular sound changes, and active associations of phonetic patterns with gender, age, and dialect.},

Second, it investigates the role which intonation plays in the identification of Norwegian dialects. In a number of listening experiments, 15 groups of young Norwegians from different parts of Norway were asked to identify 15 different dialects. The dialects were presented in the original form as well as in a version that was manipulated by computer in such a way that the intonation was removed. In this way it was possible to see how important intonation is for the identification of the dialects. The results are put into perspective by comparing them to results of similar experiments with Dutch dialects. Norwegians turned out to be less good at recognizing Norwegian dialects than Dutchmen. Linguistic and extra-linguistic explanations are given. Furthermore the results show that intonation is more important for the identification of Norwegian dialects than for the identification of Dutch dialects.},

Measures of pronunciation distance are used in several subfields of linguistics, including psycholinguistics, dialectology and typology. In contrast to the commonly used Levenshtein algorithm, NDL is grounded in cognitive theory of competitive reinforcement learning and is able to generate asymmetrical pronunciation distances. In a first study, we validated the NDL-based pronunciation distances by comparing them to a large set of native-likeness ratings given by native American English speakers when presented with accented English speech. In a second study, the NDL-based pronunciation distances were validated on the basis of perceptual dialect distances of Norwegian speakers. Results indicated that the NDL-based pronunciation distances matched perceptual distances reasonably well with correlations ranging between 0.7 and 0.8. While the correlations were comparable to those obtained using the Levenshtein distance, the NDL-based approach is more flexible as it is also able to incorporate acoustic information other than sound segments.},

These perceptions are investigated by the identification of authentic voice samples (rather than other instruments widely used in perceptual dialectology such as mental mapping): respondents from the Pays de la Loire region of north-western France heard extracts of scripted speech from Nancy and Rennes, and were asked to identify the speakers' regional background and say whether they were of urban or rural origin. The results of this test show that while some difference between the two speaker location groups was accurately perceived, the informants also formed some inaccurate judgements, partly based on social stereotypes. Overall there is some confirmation of accent levelling, and of general social psychological tendencies such as stereotyping, annexation and time-lag in perceptions of regional–social linguistic variation.},

In a first set of experiments, listeners were asked to identify the speakers’ country of origin: they achieved 60\% correct identification on average, with significant effects of listeners’ region of origin, speakers’ age, socioeconomic status, and region of origin. In a second set of experiments, listeners from Belgium, France, and Switzerland were asked to identify the speakers’ region of origin within each country (5-alternative forced choice). Results, albeit above chance, proved to be poorer than they were in the first set of experiments (31\% correct identification on average). Complementary analyses were conducted to evaluate the role of listeners’ region of origin, speakers’ age, speakers’ region of origin, and their interaction. They showed asymmetrical response patterns across the three countries under investigation: France (or, within France, Paris, which represents the norm) seems to act as a magnet and a catalyst of unification. Younger generations, especially, are more often associated with its way of speaking when their accent is not clearly identifiable. Switzerland, though, resists this homogenizing process better than Belgium does.},

Pour les jeunes locuteurs comme pour les locuteurs plus âgés, en lecture comme en parole spontanée, les résultats sont très robustes.

	abstract = {Speakers constantly learn language from the environment by sampling their linguistic input and adjusting their representations accordingly. Logically, people should attend more to the environment and adjust their behavior in accordance with it more the lower their success in the environment is. We test whether the learning of linguistic input follows this general principle in two studies: a corpus analysis of a TV game show, Jeopardy, and a laboratory task modeled after Go Fish. We show that lower (non-linguistic) success in the task modulates learning of and reliance on linguistic patterns in the environment. In Study 1, we find that poorer performance increases conformity with linguistic norms, as reflected by increased preference for frequent grammatical structures. In Study 2, which consists of a more interactive setting, poorer performance increases learning from the immediate social environment, as reflected by greater repetition of others’ grammatical structures. We propose that these results have implications for models of language production and language learning and for the propagation of language change. In particular, they suggest that linguistic changes might spread more quickly in times of crisis, or when the gap between more and less successful people is larger. The results might also suggest that innovations stem from successful individuals while their propagation would depend on relatively less successful individuals. We provide a few historical examples that are in line with the first suggested implication, namely, that the spread of linguistic changes is accelerated during difficult times, such as war time and an economic downturn.},

	abstract = {We learn language from our social environment. In general, the more sources we have, the less informative each of them is, and the less weight we should assign it. If this is the case, people who interact with fewer others should be more susceptible to the influence of each of their interlocutors. This paper tests whether indeed people who interact with fewer other people have more malleable phonological representations. Using a perceptual learning paradigm, this paper shows that individuals who regularly interact with fewer others are more likely to change their boundary between /d/ and /t/ following exposure to an atypical speaker. It further shows that the effect of number of interlocutors is not due to differences in ability to learn the speaker’s speech patterns, but specific to likelihood of generalizing the learned pattern. These results have implications for both language learning and language change, as they suggest that individuals with smaller social networks might play an important role in propagating linguistic changes.},

abstract = {A review of diachronic theories of the past few decades shows that the notion of actualization, defined as "the observable manifestation of grammar innovations in speech," is notable for its absence. To clarify the place of actualization in a theory of grammatical change, innovations are treated as logically consecutive combinations of subchanges that actually overlap in time; such change scenarios include coinage, remedial change, borrowing, extension, transference, \& interference. Each change scenario involves covert subchange processes of adoption \& reanalysis, followed by the overt subchange process of actualization in speech. Typically, speakers who actualize an innovation also produce the older usage under different conditions of appropriateness; the replacement of the latter by the former is characterized as a long-term negotiation process influenced by structural, pragmatic, stylistic, \& social factors. The speaker-oriented theory of evolutive change advocated by Alan Timberlake (1977) is positively evaluated in this context, \& the unidirectionality of grammatical change is attributed to the role of markedness in speakers' preferences for synchronic variants. 42 References.

Concepts of convergence \& divergence are indicated to be used not only in reference to internal factors affecting dialect \& standard varieties of languages, but also in relation to diasystems \& individual speakers' skills in interaction. The orientation of the studies is shown to be a social dialectological one; representations of convergence \& divergence are discussed from a sociolinguistic perspective presenting both structural \& social aspects. The discussion provides a four-part structure to discuss background material, with the first section presenting an overview of several aspects relating to historical linguistics, dialect geography, \& the consequences of language contact. A second section examines aspects related to dialect convergence \& divergence in the context of European languages. Later discussion focuses on theoretical \& methodological issues involving social psychological aspects of accommodation \& variation, with a final section providing commentary on the individual contributions to this issue of Sociolinguistica. 4 Figures, 115 References.

These “imagined borders” can nonetheless have a strong impact on the dialect continua which they crosscut. Dialect divergence at the national borders of Germany is therefore not due to impeded communication as suggested in traditional dialectology (Verkehr); rather, the borders are the limits (boundaries) of the reach of the national standard languages or of repertoire types which symbolise, in some way or other, nation-state identities. Divergence can be expected to increase to the degree that (in this order) (a) the national standard languages, (b) the repertoire types (diaglossic/diglossic) or (c) the regional dialects differ on both sides of the border.},

abstract = {Typically, modern dialects show contact-induced rather than endogenous pho- nological change, i.e. a given dialect absorbs features of other varieties of the same language with which it is in contact, often replacing the dialect's own sounds. In most cases, this process is lexicalised, i.e. it proceeds word by word, although the entire sound structure of the variety may be affected in the end. One of the unresolved questions of research on phonological dialect change is the nature of the spread of these changes. In principle, they can be due to horizontal (neighbouring dialects) or vertical contact (the standard variety or other forms with a wider range influence the dialects in the area “below” it). This paper dis- cusses some quantitative measures used to estimate the magnitude of the two alternative forms of the propagation of a change, and reports some findings for the traditional dialects of southwest Germany in the last century. On the basis of a large corpus of spontaneous speech, we present an aggregated analysis using statistical correlations and a mixed logistic regression model.},

Computer models of change are helpful because of the complexity of the behavior involved: an entire population of complex, interacting agents must be accounted for. Computational studies frequently bring to light hidden implications of theories, which make them relevant to the theoretical development of both acquisition and change. Studies of language change have focused on discovering mathematical properties of dynamical systems, or on simulating populations of speakers that interact with one another and change their internal states as a result. Models of lexical (including phonological) and syntactic change are considered. Computational models of change have proved useful tools for testing theories of language change, and will prove more useful as the field matures to include more systematic studies of the effects of varying model parameters in complex simulations. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation \textcopyright 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

These correlations lead to the identification of several larger dialect groupings, basically to a typology of dialects. In particular, we investigate the following four empirical phenomena: subject doubling, demonstrative doubling, complementizer agreement and D-pronoun fronting in imperatives. We furthermore provide an analysis of these phenomena and for the typology, showing that the syntactic base structures are identical in the dialect groups and the derivations are highly similar. Parametrization arises at two points: lexical properties with respect to the spell out of ϕ and the trigger of subject doubling.},

abstract = {Within linguistic theory, many phenomena that were previously handled by a separate grammatical component have been moved into the lexicon; in some theories, the contrast between grammar and the lexicon has disappeared altogether. In a review of findings from language development, language breakdown and real-time processing, we conclude that the case for a modular distinction between grammar and the lexicon has been overstated, and that the evidence to date is compatible with a unified lexicalist account. Studies of normal children show that the emergence of grammar is highly dependent upon vocabulary size, a finding confirmed and extended in atypical populations. Studies of language breakdown in older children and adults provide no evidence for a modular dissociation between grammar and the lexicon; some structures are especially vulnerable to brain damage (e.g. function words, non-canonical word orders), but this vulnerability is also observed in neurologically intact individuals under perceptual degradation or cognitive overload. Finally, on-line studies provide evidence for early and intricate interactions between lexical and grammatical information in normal adults. A possible characterization of this unified lexical processor is offered, based on distributed representations in recurrent neural networks.},

The mathematical structure we construct similarly has correspondences with the Fisher-Wright model of population genetics, but there are significant differences. The continuous time formulation of the model is expressed in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation. This equation is exactly soluble in the case of a single speaker and can be investigated analytically in the case of multiple speakers who communicate equally with all other speakers and give their utterances equal weight. Whilst the stationary properties of this system have much in common with the single-speaker case, time-dependent properties are richer. In the particular case where linguistic forms can become extinct, we find that the presence of many speakers causes a two-stage relaxation, the first being a common marginal distribution that persists for a long time as a consequence of ultimate extinction being due to rare fluctuations.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, linguistic typology has been moving increasingly away from its original goal of classifying languages into ideal types that would be constrained by categorical universals. What has been emerging as a new paradigm instead starts from the distribution of structures in the world, asking “what's where why?” I present here a concrete approach to this question, called ‘Distributional Typology'. The approach starts from causal theories on the forces that affect language change, from processing preferences to the historical contingencies of language contact. The predictions of these theories can then be tested against fine-grained matrices of cross-linguistic diversity, using statistical methods for estimating diachronic trends from synchronic distributions.

The complexity of social systemsmakes it difficult to eval- uate the different mechanisms empirically. We use the four-way typology of mechanisms proposed by Baxter and colleagues (2009), and define them mathematically in such a way that the effects of different mechanisms in the trajectory of a change can be modeled. The model suggests that the widely observed empirical pattern of an S-curve temporal trajectory of change can be cap- tured only if the mechanisms for propagation include replicator selection, that is, differential weighting of the competing variants in a change, except under highly specialized circumstances that probably do not hold in speech communities in general.*},

abstract = {Contact-induced change among related languages has been considered problematic for language reconstruction. In this article, I consider several aspects of the theory of language change and ways in which contact might interact with language relatedness. I show that models of language change which extrapolate dialect-contact models to languages and subgroups are problematic, and fail to take into account the unevenness of degrees of difference between languages across families. That is, diffusability clines that apply to speech communities and dialects do not appear to be in evidence for languages and subgroups. I further show that many claims about relatedness as a factor in language contact are confounded by other factors that are distinct from language relatedness, such as geographical proximity. Claims about effects of language contact appear to reduce to the type of interaction that speakers participate in, rather than structural facts about their languages. I argue that our current toolkit for reconstruction is adequate to identify contact features. Finally, I provide a typology of cases where contact might be expected to be problematic for subgrouping.},

When this contact is long-term, for example in post-colonial settings, such as the English in Australia and New Zealand (Trudgill 1986; Trudgill et al forthcoming); or as a result of, say, New Town development (Omdal 1977; Kerswill and Williams 1992, forthcoming; Britain and Simpson forthcoming); indentured labour schemes (Barz and Siegel 1988; Siegel 1997); or land reclamation (Britain 1991; Scholtmeijer 1992), the accommodation can become routinised and permanent through the process of koineisation, and a new dialect can emerge. These new dialects are characteristically less ‘complex' and contain fewer marked or minority linguistic features than the dialects which came together in the original mix. In this paper we wish to highlight another possible outcome of koineisation, namely reallocation. Reallocation occurs where two or more variants in the dialect mix survive the levelling process but are refunctionalised, evolving new social or linguistic functions in the new dialect. We provide a range of examples of social and linguistic reallocation, from a number of speech communities around the world, the dialects of which have developed from long-term contact and linguistic accommodation.},

abstract = {Speakers (and their dialects) on the move. Urry begins his 2007 book, Mobilities, by throwing some quite stunning statistics at his readers: in 2010, there were 1 billion legal international arrivals at ports and airports; in 1800 people in the US travelled on average 50 metres per day, today it is 50 kilometres per day; 8.7 per cent of world employment is in tourism; and, at any one time, there are 360, 000 passengers in flight above the United States (2007: 3-4). But very many of these mobilities for the individuals concerned are or have become rather unexceptional - a flight to a holiday in Majorca or Florida, a journey on a crowded commuter train into Madrid or Tokyo, a cross-Channel ferry to Calais in France to pick up some cheap wine and a camembert. Whilst much of the theoretically influential dialectological literature on mobility reports on long-distance, often permanent, often dangerous migrations, I turn our attention here to the dialectological consequences of this unexceptional everyday movement. I will argue that, just as more dramatic and long-distance mobilities can trigger linguistic change, so too can the much more mundane movements we engage in in everyday life. I demonstrate that the linguistic consequences of that contact are similar if not the same - perhaps less dramatic, perhaps involving the convergence of an initially less divergent array of variants - but typologically of the same ilk. And I demonstrate that because these mobilities have been long-term, intensive and ongoing, their consequences on the dialect landscape have been highly significant. Important to remember, however, is that these mobilities are socially stratified and unevenly distributed. As Wolff put it: ‘the suggestion of free and equal mobility is \ldots a deception, since we don't all have the same access to the road' (1993: 253).},

Dialectal syntactic structures are the subject of various disciplines: dialectology, theory of grammar and typology. Only some years ago the Swiss German Dialect Atlas (Sprachatlas der deutschen Schweiz (SDS)), which is considered a major work in German dialectology, was completed. Although the authors initially had the intention of including syntactic phenomena, the atlas only shows half a dozen maps demonstrating geographical syntactic variation. The reason why there are so few syntactic maps is not to be found in the research object itself, but in the specific difficulties of syntactic investigation in general. In this paper, we'll deal with the different research methods of various syntactic phenomena we use in our research project. We'll also give an overview of the investigated phenomena and we'll show the first results of our investigation with written questionnaires.},

The wave model describes the radiation of linguistic change outwards from a central focus. Changes can also jump between population centres in a process known as hierarchical diffusion . It has recently been proposed that the spatial evolution of dialects can be understood using surface tension at linguistic boundaries. Here we show that the inclusion of long-range interactions in the surface tension model generates both wave-like spread, and hierarchical diffusion, and that it is surface tension that is the dominant effect in deciding the stable distribution of dialect patterns. We generalize the model to allow population mixing which can induce shrinkage of linguistic domains, or destroy dialect regions from within.},

This area used to be a perfect dialect continuum. We test three models for explaining today's pattern of linguistic variation in the area. In each model another variable is used as the determinant of linguistic variation: geographic distance (continuum model), the state border (gap model) and social distance (social model). For the social model we use perceptual data for friends, relatives and shopping locations. Testing the three models reveals that nowadays the dialect variation in the research area is closely related to the existence of the state border and to the social structure of the area.

We conducted an extensive literature review and selected seven different approaches to conceptualising and estimating the stability of structural linguistic features, aiming at comparing them using the same dataset, the World Atlas of Language Structures. We found that, despite profound conceptual and empirical differences between these methods, they tend to agree in classifying some structural linguistic features as being more stable than others. This suggests that there are intrinsic properties of such structural features influencing their stability across methods, language families and geographic areas. This finding is a major step towards understanding the nature of structural linguistic features and their interaction with idiosyncratic, lineage- and area-specific factors during language change and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Dediu, Cysouw.},

We investigate these changes by statistical analysis of a dataset comprising 107 million Twitter messages (authored by 2.7 million unique user accounts). Using a latent vector autoregressive model to aggregate across thousands of words, we identify high-level patterns in diffusion of linguistic change over the United States. Our model is robust to unpredictable changes in Twitter's sampling rate, and provides a probabilistic characterization of the relationship of macro-scale linguistic influence to a set of demographic and geographic predictors. The results of this analysis offer support for prior arguments that focus on geographical proximity and population size. However, demographic similarity -- especially with regard to race -- plays an even more central role, as cities with similar racial demographics are far more likely to share linguistic influence. Rather than moving towards a single unified "netspeak" dialect, language evolution in computer-mediated communication reproduces existing fault lines in spoken American English.},

abstract = {Sociolinguistic studies have demonstrated that centrally-connected and peripheral members of social networks can both propel and impede the spread of linguistic innovations. We use agent-based computer simulations to investigate the dynamic properties of these network roles in a large social influence network, in which diffusion is modeled as the probabilistic uptake of one of several competing variants by agents of unequal social standing. We find that highly-connected agents, structural equivalents of leaders in empirical studies, advance on-going change by spreading competing variants. Isolated agents, or loners, holding on to existing variants are safe-keepers of variants considered old or new depending on the current state of the rest of the population. Innovations spread following a variety of S-curves and stabilize as norms in the network only if two conditions are simultaneously satisfied: (1) the network comprises extremely highly connected and very isolated agents, and (2) agents are biased to pay proportionally more attention to better connected, or popular, neighbors. These findings reconcile competing models of individual network roles in the selection and propagation process of language change, and support Bloomfield's hypothesis that the spread of linguistic innovations in heterogeneous social networks depend upon communication density and relative prestige. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluate linguistic micro-data from a unique language survey conducted between 1879 and 1888 in about 45,000 German schools. The recorded geography of dialects comprehensively portrays local cultural similarities that have been evolving for centuries, and provides an ideal opportunity to measure cultural barriers to economic exchange at a fine geographical scale. In a gravity analysis we show that cross-regional migration flows in the period 2000-2006 are positively affected by historical dialect similarity. Using different empirical strategies, we show that this finding indicates highly time-persistent cultural ties that foster economic exchange across regions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Gerritsen1999,
abstract = {This article deals with divergence on the lexical, phonological, and morphological levels in three dialects that were the same until the mid-20th century (Maaseiks in Belgium, Susters in the Netherlands, and Waldfeuchts in Germany) and that have changed under the influence of three different standard languages (Belgian Dutch, Netherlandic Dutch, and Standard German). The investigation is carried out among girls aged 14 to 16 years and women aged 35 to 50 years. Due to the unique laboratory-like situation, it was possible to gain a detailed understanding of the role of the structure of the dialect and the dialect–standard language situation in the process of dialect change under the influence of a standard language. The data indicate that the linguistic route of the change is largely the same for all dialects. This means that the receiving dialect plays an important part in the linguistic embedding of a change. However, the rationale of the linguistic road is still far from clear. The divergence of the similar dialects occurred relatively recently. Whereas the women of the three places use the old dialect forms almost exclusively, the girls use forms of the standard languages or “mixed” forms, especially in Waldfeucht. The dialect of Waldfeucht is clearly affected much more strongly by Standard German than are the dialect of Maaseik by Belgian Dutch and the dialect of Susteren by Netherlandic Dutch. This can be explained by a number of factors: the position of the dialect at school, comprehensibility of the dialect, attitude towards the dialect, and the use of the dialect. {\textcopyright} 1999, Cambridge University Press.

Being the first language of most Luxembourgers it also has the status of the national language (since 1984). Although in its origin Luxembourgish has to be considered as a Central Franconian dialect, it is nowadays regarded by the speech community as a language of its own. As a consequence, German is considered a different language. An official orthographical system has been devised. Luxembourgish is used very frequently in day-to-day oral communication at all social levels; it is very common on local radio and television; it is the only language spoken in parliament sessions and it is also very often used at the workplace. Although the vocabulary of Luxembourgish has a substantial number of loan words from French and German, the morpho-syntax follows Germanic patterns. Luxembourgish today has approximately 400,000 speakers, including many L2 speakers (around 43{\%} of the population does not have the Luxembourgish nationality). {\textcopyright} International Phonetic Association.},

But, while lan-guage change has long been a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research methods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change from differences between older and younger speak-ers. In this paper, we use a data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in progress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social influence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and " netspeak " abbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken language. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections are more influential than oth-ers, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties are significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality appears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to support the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically local social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.},

We tested twenty language combinations using the same uniform methodology, making the results commensurable for the first time. We first tested both written and spoken language by means of cloze tests. Next we calculated linguistic distance at the levels of lexicon, orthography, phonology, morphology and syntax. We also quantified exposure and attitudes towards the test languages. Finally, we carried out a regression analysis to determine the relative importance of these linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors for the mutual intelligibility between Germanic languages. The extra-linguistic predictor exposure was the most significant factor in predicting intelligibility in the Germanic language area. The effect of attitude was very small. Lexical distance, orthographic and phonetic distances were the most important linguistic predictors of intelligibility.},

To demonstrate how to apply this method, it is used to analyze regional variation in the values of 40 continuously measured, high-frequency lexical alternation variables in a 26-million-word corpus of letters to the editor representing 206 cities from across the United States.

In the standard approach to dialectometry, common patterns of regional variation are identified by analyzing the linguistic distance between a set of locations based on the values of a set of linguistic variables using statistics such as multidimensional scaling. Alternatively, in a multivariate spatial analysis, common patterns of regional variation are identified by using a factor analysis to analyze correlations between linguistic variables that are first smoothed using a local spatial autocorrelation analysis. To compare two these approaches, both methods are used to analyze the acoustic vowel data from the Atlas of North American English. It is concluded that the multivariate spatial analysis identifies clearer patterns of aggregated regional linguistic variation than the standard approach to dialectometry.},

To derive the ILD we created a database of time-series data on language demographics, which we believe to be the worlds largest. So far, the database contains information from nine editions of Ethnologue and five other compendia of speaker num- bers. The initial version of the ILD, which draws solely on the Ethnologue subset of these data, is based on a representative random sample of 1,500 of the worlds 7,299 languages (as listed in the 2005 edition). At the global level, the ILD measures how far, on aver- age, the worlds languages deviate from a hypothetical situation of stability in which each language is neither increasing nor decreasing its share of the total population of the grouping. The ILD can also be used to assess trends at various subglobal groupings. Key findings: Globally, linguistic diversity declined 20{\%} over the period 19702005. The diversity of the worlds indigenous languages declined 21{\%}. Regionally, indigenous linguistic diversity declined over 60{\%} in the Americas, 30{\%} in the Pacific (including Australia), and almost 20{\%} in Africa.},

Focusing for the most part on variation in the sound components, we test whether (I) dialect change is mainly the result of convergence to standard Dutch, (II) sound changes in two dialects which make them converge to standard Dutch also make them more similar, and (III) sound changes in two dialects which make them diverge from standard Dutch also make them less similar. We used three-dimensional (first hypothesis) and five-dimensional Levenshtein distance implementations (second and third hypothesis). These implementations are a novel step in dialectometry and in the study of ongoing processes of language change and their consequences for the dialect landscape.

Dc and dd have probably been present for as long as dialects have existed. Various historical developments, including the 'moderni-sation' of society, have left their mark on the very nature of dialects and have partly changed the dynamics of dc and dd; moreover, they have broadened them to dialect – standard language convergence. This chapter sets the stage for the various aspects of the study of dc and dd presented in this book, in that it both provides a general introduction and constitutes a springboard for the discussion of the themes and approaches which play a role in the individual chapters. As an introduction, the chapter presents the central terminology (section 2), provides the background information necessary for the interested non-specialist (section 3), sketches what we see as the main research methods (section 4), and binds together the issues featured in the various chapters (section 5).},

Although the field of linguistics has long been of interest to geographers and spatial variation of language to linguists, researchers have made little use of the power of GIS and GIScience theory to address hypotheses regarding spatial variation of language and correlated physical and social variables. Discussion of modern GIS tools for spatial analysis, quantitative analysis, and cartography in geolinguistics has been largely absent from the literature. Linguists have applied GIS technology in language atlases, including recent on-line atlases; however, analytic and data processing capabilities are seldom discussed. Following a review of geolinguistics work incorporating GIS, this article discusses potentially useful GIS tools and techniques for geolinguistics. The article concludes with reflection on the future role of GIS in geolinguistic thought and practice. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {In this paper, we analyse spatial variation in the Japanese dialectal lexicon by assembling a set of methodologies using theories in variationist linguistics and GIScience, and tools used in historical GIS. Based on historical dialect atlas data, we calculate a linguistic distance matrix across survey localities. The linguistic variation expressed through this distance is contrasted with several measurements, based on spatial distance, utilised to estimate language contact potential across Japan, historically and at present. Further, administrative boundaries are tested for their separation effect. Measuring aggregate associations within linguistic variation can contrast previous notions of dialect area formation by detecting continua. Depending on local geographies in spatial subsets, great circle distance, travel distance and travel times explain a similar proportion of the variance in linguistic distance despite the limitations of the latter two. While they explain the majority, two further measurements estimating contact have lower explanatory power: least cost paths, modelling contact before the industrial revolution, based on DEM and sea navigation, and a linguistic influence index based on settlement hierarchy. Historical domain boundaries and present day prefecture boundaries are found to have a statistically significant effect on dialectal variation. However, the interplay of boundaries and distance is yet to be identified. We claim that a similar methodology can address spatial variation in other digital humanities, given a similar spatial and attribute granularity.},

The first step in the analysis, the computa- tion of linguistic distance.between each pair of sites, can be computed as Leven- shtein distance between phonetic strings. This correlates closely with the much more laborious technique of determining and counting isoglosses, and is more ac- curate than the more familiar metric of computing Hamming distance based on whether vocabulary entries match. In the actual clustering step, traditional ag- glomerative clustering works better thaxl the top-down technique of partitioning around medoids. When agglomerative clustering of phonetic string comparison distances is applied to Gaelic, reasonable dialect boundaries are obtained, corre- sponding to national and (within Ire- land) provincial boundaries.},

For each of the 12 vowels studied, its various pronunciations within a single word (e.g., /i/ in three, /I/ in six, etc.) were tallied for the overall sample of 1,162 speakers and for nine subsamples, representative of three domains from the altas data: sex, education/social adjustment (three types), and occupation (four types). The results show that for each vowel, at each level of analysis, the pronunciation type/frequency rankings form a nonlinear distribution, represented graphically by an asymptotic hyperbolic curve (or A-curve), with only a few of the most frequent vowel realizations accounting for the vast majority of tokens. While there is a large amount of pronunciation overlap between regional or social groups, comparison of the type/frequency rankings shows that different groups of speakers each have different orders of the frequent variant realizations of the vowels, which helps explain how one can distinguish one group's speech from another's but does not support the traditional notion of contrast as absolute, binary, and categorical.},

Linguists have generally assumed that those contexts in which the new form is more common are those in which the form first appears and in which it advances most rapidly. However, evidence from several linguistic changes (most importantly the rise of the periphrastic auxiliary do in late Middle English) shows that the general assumption is false. Instead, at least for syntactic cases, change seems to proceed at the same rate in all contexts. Contexts change together because they are merely surface manifestations of a single underlying change in grammar. Differences in frequency of use of a new form across contexts reflect functional and stylistic factors, which are constant across time and independent of grammar.},

abstract = { To summarise: On Martha's Vineyard a small group of fishermen began to exaggerate a tendency already existing in their speech. They did this seemingly subconsciously, in order to establish themselves as an independent social group with superior status to the despised summer visitors. A number of other islanders regarded this group as one which epitomised old virtues and desirable values, and subconsciously imitated the way its members talked. For these people, the new pronunciation was an innovation. As more and more people came to speak in the same way, the innovation gradually became the norm for those living on the island.   Did field work study in 1961 - first study to be done in sociolinguistic framework - move away from question/answer regional dialectology and beginning to know the community to understand variation in lang.He actually recorded people speaking, not just asked them about what they did - revolutionised dialectology. Found that synchonic variation (variation now) is root of diachronic variation (variation over time).  Diphthong PRICE and MOUTH analysed - islanders used more raised centralised onset. But they didn;t use it all the time - was interspeaker variation and intraspeaker variation. Challenged idea of free variation. Coded vowels according to how raised and backed the onset of the diphthong was. Lower onsets received lower score, and more raised and centralised ones received a higher score. Used index  scores to get averages for each speaker and then average for groups of speakers, e.g. women aged 60. (69 speakers).  Results : found that linguistic factors accounted for variation, e.g. following phonetic environment /t, s, p, f/ then centralised variant used                  found non-linguistic factors accounted for variation as well, eg. peoples affiliation/attitudes towards the island.                },

We compare large-scale quantitative studies with more traditional theoretical and historical linguistic research and identify divergent assumptions and methods that have led linguists to be skeptical of correlational work. We also attempt to demystify statistical techniques and point out the importance of informed cri- tiques of the validity of statistical approaches. Finally, we describe various methods used in recent correlational studies to deal with the fact that, because of contact and historical relatedness, individual lan- guages in a sample rarely represent independent data points, and we show how these methods may allow us to explore linguistic prehistory to a greater time depth than is possible with orthodox comparative reconstruction.},

abstract = {Good barriers make good languages. Scholars have long speculated that geographical barriers impede linguistic contact between speech communities and promote language diversification in a manner similar to the process of allopatric speciation. This hypothesis, however, has seldom been tested systematically and quantitatively. Here, we adopt methods from evolutionary biology and attempt to quantify the influence of oceanic barriers on the degree of lexical diversity in the Japanese Islands. Measuring the degree of beta diversity from basic vocabularies, we find that geographical proximity and, more importantly, isolation by surrounding ocean, independently explains a significant proportion of lexical variation across Japonic languages. Further analyses indicate that our results are neither a by-product of using a distance matrix derived from a Bayesian language phylogeny nor an epiphenomenon of accelerated evolutionary rates in languages spoken by small communities. Moreover, we find that the effect of oceanic barriers is reproducible with the Ainu languages, indicating that our analytic approach as well as the results can be generalized beyond Japonic language family. The findings we report here are the first quantitative evidence that physical barriers formed by ocean can influence language diversification and points to an intriguing common mechanism between linguistic and biological evolution.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing linguistic phenomena with smartphone applications is relatively new. In linguistics, apps have predominantly been developed to create pronunciation dictionaries, to train acoustic models, and to archive endangered languages. This paper presents the first account of how apps can be used to collect data suitable for documenting language change: we created an app, Dial \"{a}kt \"{A}pp (D \"{A}), which predicts users' dialects. For 16 linguistic variables, users select a dialectal variant from a drop-down menu. D \"{A} then geographically locates the user's dialect by suggesting a list of communes where dialect variants most similar to their choices are used. Underlying this prediction are 16 maps from the historical Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland, which documents the linguistic situation around 1950. Where users disagree with the prediction, they can indicate what they consider to be their dialect's location. With this information, the 16 variables can be assessed for language change. Thanks to the playfulness of its functionality, D \"{A} has reached many users; our linguistic analyses are based on data from nearly 60,000 speakers. Results reveal a relative stability for phonetic variables, while lexical and morphological variables seem more prone to change. Crowdsourcing large amounts of dialect data with smartphone apps has the potential to complement existing data collection techniques and to provide evidence that traditional methods cannot, with normal resources, hope to gather. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize a range of methodological caveats, including sparse knowledge of users' linguistic backgrounds (users only indicate age, sex) and users' self-declaration of their dialect. These are discussed and evaluated in detail here. Findings remain intriguing nevertheless: as a means of quality control, we report that traditional dialectological methods have revealed trends similar to those found by the app. This underlines the validity of the crowdsourcing method. We are presently extending D \"{A} architecture to other languages.},

abstract = {url: https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2049754716000111/type/journal \_article Most recent studies on the geographical distribution of acoustic features analyze comparatively few speakers and localities, both of which may be unrepresentative of the diversity found in larger or more spatially fragmented populations. In the present study we introduce a new paradigm that enables the crowdsourcing of acoustic features through smartphone devices. We used Dial \"{a}kt \"{A}pp , a free iOS app that allows users to record themselves, to crowdsource audio data. Nearly 3,000 speakers from 452 localities in German-speaking Switzerland provided recordings; we measured articulation rates for these speakers using a metric based on duration intervals between consecutive vowel onsets. Results revealed distinct regional differences in articulation rate between major dialect regions and individual localities. The specification of 452 localities enabled analyses at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Results further revealed a robust effect of gender, with women articulating significantly more slowly than men. Both the geographical patterns and the effect of gender found in this study corroborate similar findings on Swiss German previously reported in a very limited set of localities, thus verifying the validity of the crowdsourcing framework. Given the application of this new framework, a large bulk of the discussion is devoted to discussing methodological caveats.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the English Dialects App (EDA) and the English Dialects App Corpus (EDAC). EDA is a free iOS and Android app, launched in January 2016 that features a dialect quiz and dialect recordings. For the quiz, users indicate which variants of 26 words they use and the application guesses their local dialect; for the recordings, users can record a short text. The result is EDAC which includes metadata on mobility, ethnicity, age, educational level, and gender. More than 47,000 users from across the UK have indicated dialect variants for these 26 words, and more than 3,500 users have provided audio recordings. Unavoidably, EDAC does not successfully reflect distributions of age, ethnicity, qualification levels, and other parameters found for the UK population given that smartphone-based research reaches a specific stratum of the population. Yet there are also clear benefits to the sampling strategy used – benefits and pitfalls are discussed in this article. Future analyses will provide the most comprehensive understanding of English regional dialect variation since the work of the traditional dialectologists. We showcase two such analyses in this article. EDAC should, we demonstrate, be of interest to researchers in dialectology but also in forensic phonetics.},

Language and culture are intimately connected and linguists often use distinctive keywords to quantify the dynamics of information spreading in societies harboring strong culture centers. One prominent example, which is addressed here, is Kyoto's historical impact on Japanese culture. We construct a minimal model, based on shared properties of linguistic maps, to address the interplay between information flow and geography. We show that spreading of information over Japan in the premodern time can be described by an Eden growth process with noise levels corresponding to coherent spatial patches of sizes given by a single day's walk (∼15 km), and that new words appear in Kyoto at times comparable to the time between human generations (∼30 yr). {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

Cavalli Sforza et al., 1994, among others). We argue that parametric analyses of grammatical diversity in theoretical linguistics, stemming from Chomsky (1981), can prompt analogous progress in the historical classification of language families, by showing that abstract syntactic properties are reliable indicators of phylogenetic relations. The pursuit of this approach radically questions the traditional belief in the orthogonality of grammatical typology and language genealogy, broadly supporting Nichols' (1992) program, and ultimately contributes to establishing formal grammar as a population science and historical linguistics as an important part of cognitive inquiry. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The correlation analysis was performed by combining two complementary approaches proposed in dialectometric literature, namely by computing both global and place-specific correlation measures and by inspecting their spatial distribution.

abstract = {A careful investigation of synchronic patterns of linguistic variation with underlying linguistic features can lead to important insights into the comprehension of diachronic phonetic processes. In this article, we showed that the method of spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs applied to synchronic dialectal data can effectively and reliably be used to investigate diachronic processes, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of the relationship between synchronic variation and diachronic change. This was illustrated through a case study carried out on Tuscan dialects, focusing on so-called Tuscan 'gorgia', a lenition process consisting of the spirantization of stop consonants. In particular, from a quantitative analysis of the sound correspondences involving voiceless and voiced stops, we tracked the evolution of the spirantization phenomenon in several respects. First, we tracked spirantization geographically, across Tuscany from the influential center of Florence to the peripheral areas. Second, we tracked it phonologically, from voiceless to voiced stops, and within each voicing class from velars to dentals and then to bilabials. Finally, we tracked it demographically, with young speakers using the most innovative sound correspondences more than old speakers. The fact that these results are in line with the literature on the topic of Tuscan 'gorgia' demonstrates the potential of the method of spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs with respect to the reconstruction of diachronic processes starting from diatopically distributed synchronic dialectal data. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

Although individual maps are interesting, and numerical data relating to the relative prominence of dialect areas can be extracted, an important value of the draw-a-map task is in aggregating data. This was always an aim of the contemporary PD method, although the nature of the data has meant that this has not always been possible. Here, we argue for the use of geographic information systems (GIS) in order to aggregate, process, and display PD data. Using case studies from the United Kingdom and Germany, we present examples of data processed using GIS and illustrate the future possibilities for the use of GIS in PD research.},

We proceed then from two simplifying assumptions: first, that all linguistic variation is the result of either diffusion or independent innovation, and, second, that we may operationalize social contact as geographical distance. It is clear that both of these assumptions are imperfect, but they allow us to examine diffusion via the distribution of linguistic variation as a function of geographical distance. Several studies in quantitative linguistics have examined this relation, starting with S \'{e}guy (S \'{e}guy 1971 Rev. Linguist. Romane 35, 335-357), and virtually all report a sublinear growth in aggregate linguistic variation as a function of geographical distance. The literature from dialectology and historical linguistics has mostly traced the diffusion of individual features, however, so that it is sensible to ask what sort of dynamic in the diffusion of individual features is compatible with S \'{e}guy's curve. We examine some simulations of diffusion in an effort to shed light on this question.},

abstract = {This paper proceeds from a quantitative perspective and applies measurements of linguistic difference to obtain characterizations of the aggregate relations among varieties in entire language areas. From there it is a small step in quantitative methodology to ask how much geographic distance influences (aggregate) linguistic differences, applying a regression design. The paper goes on to contrast the degree to which a very bare concept of geography, just distance, competes with a more complicated one, involving areas or regions, in explaining the aggregate linguistic differences among language varieties. The data is taken from dialect atlases and various other collections, and the linguistic distance is measured using a variant of Levenshtein distance, which has been demonstrated to be valid with respect to dialect speakers' judgments of linguistic difference. Pure geographic distance models account for between 14{\%} and 38{\%} of the variation found in the data in straightforward regression designs. The alternative to pure distance models involves dialect areas, which we examine on the basis of the independently established dialect areas in Wrede's famous map of German dialect areas, adding dialect divisions as categorical independent variables to assess their explanatory value. This increases the explained variation from 32{\%} to 45{\%} in the German dialect dataset, indicating that geography is indeed structured more complexly than simple distances, and also that geography influences linguistic variation deeply.},

@article{Nguyen2015,
abstract = {Language is a social phenomenon and inherent to its social nature is that it is constantly changing. Recently, a surge of interest can be observed within the computational linguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language. In this article we present a survey of the emerging field of "Computational Sociolinguistics" that reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction and multilingual communication. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions employed in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.},

@article{Nguyen2017,
abstract = {Quantifying the degree of spatial dependence for linguistic variables is a key task for analyzing dialectal variation. However, existing approaches have important drawbacks. First, they make unjustified assumptions about the nature of spatial variation: some assume that the geographical distribution of linguistic variables is Gaussian, while others assume that linguistic variation is aligned to pre-defined geopolitical units such as states or counties. Second, they are not applicable to all types of linguistic data: some approaches apply only to frequencies, others to boolean indicators of whether a linguistic variable is present. We present a new method for measuring geographical language variation, which solves both of these problems. Our approach builds on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) representations for nonparametric statistics, and takes the form of a test statistic that is computed from pairs of individual geotagged observations without aggregation into predefined geographical bins. We compare this test with prior work using synthetic data as well as a diverse set of real datasets: a corpus of Dutch tweets, a Dutch syntactic atlas, and a dataset of letters to the editor in North American newspapers. Our proposed test is shown to support robust inferences across a broad range of scenarios and types of data.},

(2009) and Pickl and Rumpf (2011, 2012) is a method for the unsupervised generation of maps visualizing geolinguistic data on the level of linguistic variables. It also extracts spatial information for subsequent statistical analysis. However, as intensity estimation involves geographically conditioned smoothing, this method can lead to undesirable results. Geolinguistically relevant structures such as rivers, political borders or enclaves, for instance, are not taken into account and thus their manifestations in the distributions of linguistic variants are blurred. A possible solution to this problem, as suggested and put to the test in this paper, is to use linguistic distances rather than geographical (Euclidean) distances in the estimation. This methodological adjustment leads to maps which render geolinguistic distributions more faithfully, especially in areas that are deemed critical for the interpretation of the resulting maps and for subsequent statistical analyses of the results.},

abstract = {In this article, a threefold link is established between the concept of dialect areas as scientific constructs, prototype theory as a descriptive model and factor analysis as an operationalisation of the former two. While the idea of using prototype theory to model emic, folk concepts of dialect areas is not new, it is here for the first time used to establish a scholarly, etic model of dialect areas, which will make it easier to compare emically and etically defined dialect areas in the future. Dialect areas can be conceived of as being crisp or fuzzy, but in most cases, they are best concep- tualised as being fuzzy. Following work by Gaetano Berruto, fuzzy dialect areas are defined on the basis of sets of similarly distributed variants. In a second, more prac- tical step, an operationalisation of this model is presented that uses factor analysis to extract spatial patterns from geolinguistic data that satisfy the model's defini- tion of dialect area. This methodology is illustrated by applying it to dialect data from Bavarian Swabia (Southern Germany). The geolinguistic structures revealed demonstrate the utility of factor analysis as a tool both for a detailed, in-depth dif- ferentiation of fuzzy dialect areas and for the detection of hitherto unknown, even very weak spatial patterns. 1},

Categories which reflected such an organization (where the presumed natural prototypes were central tendencies of the categories) and categories which violated the organization (natural prototypes peripheral) were taught to a total of 162 members of a Stone Age culture which did not initially have hue or geometric-form concepts. In both domains, the presumed "natural" categories were consistently easier to learn than the "distorted" categories. Even when not central, natural prototype stimuli tended to be more rapidly learned and more often chosen as the most typical example of the category than were other stimuli. Implications for general differences between natural categories and the artificial categories of concept formation research were discussed. ?? 1973.},

@phdthesis{Sanders2010,
abstract = {This dissertation establishes the utility and reliability of a statistical distance measure for syntactic dialectometry, expanding dialectometry's methods to include syntax as well as phonology and the lexicon. It establishes the measure's reliability by comparing its results to those of dialectology and phonological dialectometry on Swedish dialects, as well as evaluating variant parameter settings. The research questions of this dissertation are (1) whether a statistical measure of syntax for dialectometry will reproduce the results of syntactic dialectology and phonological dialectometry and (2) what parameter settings produce results most similar to dialectology's results. Statistical dialect distance is defined in two parts: a feature set that captures linguistic properties and a measure of dissimilarity that combines two sites' features into a single number. This dissertation uses feature sets from previous work: trigrams (Nerbonne \& Wiersma, 2006) and leaf-ancestor paths (Sanders, 2007). In addition, it introduces two other feature sets: leaf-head paths based on dependencies and phrase-structure rules. This dissertation uses the measure R (Nerbonne \& Wiersma 2006) as well as measures from information theory: Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences and cosine similarity. This statistical distance is tested on the Swediasyn, a corpus of interviews recorded in villages throughout Sweden. After the distance was measured, the distances were processed and then compared with existing dialectology results. Unlike previous work, significant distances were measured between dialect corpora in this dissertation. When these distances are mapped to the geography of Sweden, they reproduce the traditional dialect regions of Sweden. There is weak correlation with geographic distance, but good agreement between dialectometric syntactic and phonological distance. Comparing specific dialect features with those of dialectology is inconclusive; better comparison methods are needed.},

@phdthesis{Scherrer2012c,
abstract = {This thesis proposes to combinemethods and data fromtwo rather distant fields of language science – dialectology and human language technology – into a system that automatically trans- forms StandardGermanwords and sentences intomultiple SwissGerman dialects. The resulting system is designed to benefit fromthe etymological proximity of these language varieties and fromdatamade available by dialectological research. We qualify this scenario as cross-lingual, multi-dialectal sentence generation: cross-lingual in the sense that it describes the relation between two vertically opposed language varieties, Standard German and Swiss German, and multi-dialectal in the sense that the Swiss German side of themodel is intended to cover the whole range of internal dialectal variation. While it would bemost intuitive to generate dialect output in its naturally occurring spoken form, we focus here on written output. Our work draws on previous research in two different and complementary ways. On the one hand, we use, develop and extendmethods that have been proposed to describe dialects (theo- retically or computationally), their variation patterns and their relation with a standard variety. In particular, ourmethodology recalls earlier theoretical work in generative dialectology, which views dialect change as processes formalized as rules, and posits a reference system fromwhich the dialectal variants are derived. On the other hand,we rely on studies of the dialectological and socio-linguistic particularities of language use in German-speaking Switzerland. We draw on these resources, and in particular on the Swiss German dialect atlases Sprachatlas der deutschen Schweiz and Syntaktischer Atlas der deutschen Schweiz, to compile a comparativemulti-dialect grammar of Swiss German as an empirical foundation of our system. The key concept put forward in this thesis is the one of georeferenced transfer rule. Indeed, the relation between StandardGerman and SwissGerman ismodelledwith the help of transfer rules operating on several levels of linguistic analysis.

Based on existing projects—the Database of Bavarian Dialects in Austria and exploreAT!—this paper elaborates on a spatio-temporal Linked Data model for representing linguistic/dialect data. Here we focus on utilizing existing data and publishing them using a virtual RDF graph. Additionally, we exploit external data sources like DBPedia and geonames.org, to specify the meaning of dialect records and make use of stable geographical placenames. In the paper we highlight a spatio-temporal modeling and representation of linguistic records relying on the notion of a discrete lifespan of an object. Based on a real-world example—using the lemma “Karotte” (engl. carrot) we show how the usage of a specific dialect word (“Karottn”) changes from 1916 until 2016—by exploiting the expressive power of GeoSPARQL.},

It argues that isolation is a multifaceted phenomenon with geographic, social and attitudinal implications.

abstract = {The Syntactic Atlas of German‐speaking Switzerland (Syntaktischer Atlas der Deutschen Schweiz (SADS)) is an atlas project aiming to collect dialect/syntactic data in German speaking Switzerland. So far, only point maps have been generated out of the SADS data basis. Assumptions about the distribution of syntactic phenomena over space do exist but they have never been analysed quantitatively. Selected questions on three syntactic phenomena provide the data framework of this thesis. The goal is on one hand to create areal syntactic dialect maps and on the other to use geostatistical methods to test spatial hypotheses about the distribution of the examined linguistic phenomena. Using relative intensities of syntactic variants at the sampled places the method of Rumpf et al. (2009) has been implemented successfully. It uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to transform linguistic phenomena into areas with dominant variants which are graduated by their intensity of occurence. In the geostatistical analysis part, structural characteristics about compactness, complexity and homogeneity have proven useful to provide an overview of the spatial characteristics of the specific questions. The geostatistical methods to test the spatial hypotheses include Moran's , Getis‐Ord  , Trend Surface Analysis and semivariogram models. The methods provided in this thesis can be extended to further phenomena in the future.},

After reviewing the challenges of lin- guistic data visualization, point symbol maps are introduced as a baseline. We then present alter- native visualization methods that present linguistic data in new ways. The first uses Voronoi polygons about the data points to color in the dominant variant per location. The second uses kernel density estimation (KDE) to interpolate intensity values of all variants and thus infer and display the dominant variant per location (incl. at missing value locations). The KDE-based method helps to better see trends in the data and also automatically infer isoglosses. The third new technique uses 3-D visualization to support the exploration of spatial trends, as well as co- occurring variants. As a fourth alternative, measures and methods from geostatistics are used for the visualization of specific, global and local, variations and patterns.},

The amount of syntactic variation which can be accounted for by geography will be determined. Dialectometric techniques will be used to develop an additive measure of syntactic differences. Multidimensional scaling will be applied to visualise the geographic distribution of the Dutch dialects with respect to syntactic variation in the aggregate. The Dutch dialect map based on a syntactic measure will be compared with a dialect map based on subjective judgements and a dialect map based on pronunciation differences to put the syntactic measurement results into perspective. An alternative way to measure syntactic distance will be presented and will provide indications for future research to more accurately quantify syntactic variation},

First, we showthat pronunciation is marginally more strongly associated with syntax than it is with lexis and that syntax and lexis are only weakly associated. Then, we check for the influence of geography as an underlying factor because geography is known to strongly correlate with each of the linguistic levels under investigation. We find that pronunciation and syntax are more strongly associated with geography than lexis is. Finally, we refine the results by accounting for the influence of geography as an underlying factor and show that the association between pronunciation and syntax turns out to be largely based on geography. Some influence between pronunciation and syntax remains but the association between pronunciation and lexis is stronger. There is virtually no association between syntax and lexis.},

abstract = {url: http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract \_S0954394512000087 In many societies, dialectometry has revealed strong correlations between geographic distances and dialect differences (e.g., Gooskens, 2005; Heeringa \& Nerbonne, 2001; Nerbonne, 2009, 2010). But what happens when dialectometry is applied to a small, clan-based society such as the indigenous Sui people of rural southwest China? The Sui results show a strong correlation between dialect difference and geographic distance, thus supporting Nerbonne and Kleiweg's (2007) Fundamental Dialectological Postulate. A new culturally specific computation, “rice paddy distance,” also provides a strong correlation with dialect differences. However, the study finds that some dialectometry patterns of larger societies are not “compressible” into small societies such as Sui. Clan exogamy also poses challenges for dialectometry. Nonetheless, the overall results show that basic principles of dialect variation in space can be generalized cross-culturally, even across very different cultures. This paper also suggests a “lower limit” for dialectology, that is, the smallest distance where regional dialectology may be relevant, all other things being equal.},

abstract = {In this study, we present the first agent-based simulation of vowel chain shifts across large communities, providing a parsimonious reinterpretation of Labov's (2007) notions of transmission, diffusion, and incrementation. Labov determined that parent-to-child transmission faithfully reproduces structural patterns such as the Northern Cities Shift (NCS), but adult-to-adult diffusion does not. NCS is transmitted faithfully to new generations of U.S. Inland North children. But St. Louis speakers, depending only on adult-adult contact, only attain an incomplete, unsystematic version. Labov (2007) attributed the difference to children's superior language-learning ability; transmission and diffusion are categorically different processes in that approach. By contrast, our multiagent simulation suggests that such transmission/diffusion effects can be derived by simple density of interactions and simple exemplar learning; we also find that incrementation is a natural outcome of this model. Unlike Labov (2007), this model does not require a dichotomy between transmission and diffusion. While dichotomous assumptions about child versus adult learning may be necessary in other contexts, our results suggest that the NCS effects in Labov (2007) may be explained economically in terms of simple density of interactions between speakers. Our results also provide an agent-based perspective supporting and explicating the notion of speech community.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the question of how areas with different syntactic variability can be identified. It uses data from the ‘Syntactic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland‘ (SADS) which uses multiple informants in each survey location. As a starting point the well-known doubling construction with the verb aafange ‘begin' is used to illustrate how the different regions differ with respect to inter-personal variation and how the different variants can be mapped in terms of predominance, i.e. to what extent they co-occur or compete with the other variants. As a quantitative measure, the intensity value of the dominant variant (i.e. the agreement rate between those informants providing the dominant variant as their variant) is used as the basis to create a so-called “variation index”. This technique is applied to a larger set of SADS data, and the results are mapped onto the survey points indicating the syntactic variability for each location. To assess the validity of the method, several subgroups are created which turn out to correlate with the whole data set at a significant level. By performing a hot spot analysis, regional clusters of high/low syntactic variability can be identified.},

What are the properties of language users such that we can account for these characteristics? To address this question, we built a computational model of a social network of language users. By holding the network structure constant and varying properties of the language users, we found that language change reflects both the structure of social networks and properties of language users. In particular, our results suggest that although language users must be capable of probabilistically accessing multiple grammars, they must prefer to access a single grammar categorically.},

abstract = {Traditional Estonian dialect classifications are based on the phonology, morphology, and lexis, and there are very few studies about syntax available. The present article is the first quantitative syntactic study of Estonian dialects. We concentrate on constructions consisting of finite and non-finite verbs, and we apply contemporary statistical methods to explore the syntactic variation. Our results show that even bare token frequencies can identify syntactic patterns quite well, and that analyses exploiting collostructional methods makes the variational patterns even clearer. We use correspondence analysis and clustering to detect geographic influence on variation. The results suggest a syntax-based classification of dialects differs from the traditional classifications based mainly on phonology and lexis. Our data reveal systematic differences between eastern and western dialects at the syntactic level, whereas analyses based on phonology and lexis distinguish mainly between northern and southern dialects. The western dialects make more use of analytic constructions consisting of a finite and a non-finite verb form. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

abstract = {This article investigates several linguistic changes which are ongoing in north-western Catalan using a contemporary corpus. We take advantage of a range of dialectometric methods that allow us to calculate and analyse the linguistic distance between varieties in apparent time from an aggregate perspective. Specifically, we pay attention to the process of structural dialect loss due to linguistic advergence to standard and eastern Catalan in many north-western Catalan dialects located in Catalonia (Spain) and Andorra. We also provide evidence that the dialect leveling taking place in these two areas strongly contrasts with the relative stability of the Catalan dialects on the other side of the Catalan-Aragonese border in Spain, where Catalan is not an official language. These opposite sociolinguistic situations (Catalonia and Andorra have strong language policies to support Catalan, whereas Aragon does not) have triggered a twofold process of vertical advergence between the Catalan spoken in Catalonia and Andorra towards the prestigious varieties, on the one hand; and of horizontal divergence between these dialects and those located in Aragon, on the other hand. This situation has notably strengthened the border differences between Aragon and Catalonia during the last 80 years. This article is one of the first attempts to study the border effects not only between regions belonging to different countries but also between different administrative regions within' the same country. In addition, we investigate the different roles of urban versus rural areas, providing support for the view that the spatial and hierarchical diffusion patterns are complementary.},

@incollection{vanGijn2017rivers,
abstract = {Introduction The linguistic diversity of the South American continent is quite impressive. There are 576 indigenous languages attested (well enough documented to be classified family-wise), of which 404 are not yet extinct. There are 56 poorly attested languages (which nevertheless were arguably not the same as any of the 576), of which three are known to be not yet extinct (Nordhoff et al. 2013). Furthermore, there are 71 uncontacted living tribes, mainly in Brazil, which may speak anywhere between zero and 71 languages different from those mentioned (Brackelaire and Azanha 2006). Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the linguistic diversity of South American indigenous languages is their genealogical diversity. The languages fall into some 65 isolates and 44 families (Campbell 2012a; Nordhoff et al. 2013), based on a comparison of basic vocabulary. Nearly all of the families show little internal diversity, indicative of a shallow time depth. Alongside this picture of genealogical diversity, many areal specialists have noted the widespread occurrence of a number of linguistic features across language families, suggesting either sustained contacts between groups of people or remnants from times when the situation in South America may have been genealogically more homogeneous. We only have historical records going back about 500 years, and the archaeological record is scanty and fragmentary (Eriksen 2011). It follows that there are large tracts of South American prehistory that are unknown. Areal-typological analysis aims to address this gap by finding out which languages have been in contact and how, as evidenced by their typological features. Potentially, the location and intensity of language contact could answer questions about the (un)likelihood of deep genealogical relations and duration of interaction, and provide clues regarding the settlement of the continent. Intertwined with the goal of unravelling history is the modelling of different contact processes. We are not yet in a position to predict the linguistic outcome from a given contact scenario or vice versa (Muysken 2010). To achieve this, attested contact scenarios and attested typological feature distributions need to be confronted further. However, there is another potentially significant set of variables that is so far largely unexplored in areal-typological linguistics, namely those related to physical geography.},

abstract = {In this study we examine linguistic variation and its dependence on both social and geographic factors. We follow dialectometry in applying a quantitative methodology and focusing on dialect distances, and social dialectology in the choice of factors we examine in building a model to predict word pronunciation distances from the standard Dutch language to 424 Dutch dialects. We combine linear mixed-effects regression modeling with generalized additive modeling to predict the pronunciation distance of 559 words. Although geographical position is the dominant predictor, several other factors emerged as significant. The model predicts a greater distance from the standard for smaller communities, for communities with a higher average age, for nouns (as contrasted with verbs and adjectives), for more frequent words, and for words with relatively many vowels. The impact of the demographic variables, however, varied from word to word. For a majority of words, larger, richer and younger communities are moving towards the standard. For a smaller minority of words, larger, richer and younger communities emerge as driving a change away from the standard. Similarly, the strength of the effects of word frequency and word category varied geographically. The peripheral areas of the Netherlands showed a greater distance from the standard for nouns (as opposed to verbs and adjectives) as well as for high-frequency words, compared to the more central areas. Our findings indicate that changes in pronunciation have been spreading (in particular for low-frequency words) from the Hollandic center of economic power to the peripheral areas of the country, meeting resistance that is stronger wherever, for well-documented historical reasons, the political influence of Holland was reduced. Our results are also consistent with the theory of lexical diffusion, in that distances from the Hollandic norm vary systematically and predictably on a word by word basis.},

abstract = {This study uses a generalized additive mixed-effects regression model to predict lexical differ- ences in Tuscan dialects with respect to standard Italian.We used lexical information for 170 con- cepts used by 2,060 speakers in 213 locations in Tuscany. In ourmodel, geographical position was found to be an important predictor,with locationsmore distant fromFlorence having lexical forms more likely to differ from standard Italian. In addition, the geographical pattern varied signifi- cantly for low- versus high-frequency concepts and older versus younger speakers. Younger speakers generally used variants more likely to match the standard language. Several other factors emerged as significant.Male speakers as well as farmers weremore likely to use lexical forms dif- ferent from standard Italian. In contrast, higher-educated speakers used lexical forms more likely to match the standard. The model also indicates that lexical variants used in smaller communities are more likely to differ from standard Italian. The impact of community size, however, varied from concept to concept. For a majority of concepts, lexical variants used in smaller communities are more likely to differ from the standard Italian form. For a minority of concepts, however, lex- ical variants used in larger communities are more likely to differ from standard Italian. Similarly, the effect of the other community- and speaker-related predictors varied per concept. These results clearly show that the model succeeds in teasing apart different forces influencing the dialect land- scape and helps us to shed light on the complex interaction between the standard Italian language and the Tuscan dialectal varieties. In addition, this study illustrates the potential of generalized ad- ditive mixed-effects regression modeling applied to dialect data.},

@article{Willis2017,
abstract = {Morphosyntactic dialect variation, once a neglected area of dialect research, has recently witnessed a large growth in interest. Various methods from geospatial data analysis have been applied to morphosyntactic data. To date, the focus has largely been on analysing the distribution of stable patterns of variation. This article extends this work to examine patterns of ongoing change. It uses a body of data from the Syntactic Atlas of Welsh Dialects and the Siarad Corpus of spoken Welsh to examine the innovation and diffusion of a new second- person singular pronoun, chdi, testing the usefulness of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) as a method for identifying and modelling patterns of ongoing syntactic change. It is shown that GWR provides plausible models of the diachronic development of changes that are still in progress. Furthermore, it allows us to test whether rates of change are constant across geographical space, allowing us to test whether the Constant Rate Hypothesis (that diffusion of change proceeds at the same rate in different environments) holds between dialects. 1},

abstract = {This paper introduces the pilot project for the Syntactic Atlas of Welsh Dialects, setting out the procedures for data collection and sketching a case study for one variable within the dataset, namely the patterns of negative concord found with the negative modal cau 'won't'. This item is a relatively recent innovation, and it is currently undergoing increasing integration into the negative concord system. The atlas fieldwork establishes current patterns of dialect variation, showing significant age variation indicative of change in progress and the rise of negative concord in this context. On the basis of this, it is argued that the diffuse geographical patterns attested are best interpreted as evidence of multiple innovation across a wide area, with new speakers re-implementing the innovation ("multiple reactuation"). A formal analysis is sketched out, treating the change as moving along a pathway of feature change with semantic features shifting to interpretable syntactic features and then to uninterpretable syntactic ones. This analysis is consistent with the dialect patterns and interspeaker implicational hierarchies found in the data.},

  abstract     = {This thesis investigates the socio-cultural and linguistic development of pre-Columbian Amazonia, with a particular focus on the period between 500 BC and AD 1500. In assembling and analyzing data from archaeology, linguistics, ethnohistory, ethnography, and geography in a Geographical Information System (G.I.S.), it synthesizes large amounts of empirical data from several fields to facilitate long-term, macro-scale reconstructions of pre-Columbian socio-cultural processes in the region. These reconstructions focus on identifying the socio-economic and socio-cultural mechanisms underlying processes of cultural and linguistic expansion and subsequent patterns of ethno-linguistic diversity. The thesis thus addresses long-standing debates on the role of migration, ecology, subsistence strategies, trade, language, and ethnicity in such processes, and offers new explanations of the distribution of language families and ethno-linguistic groups in Amazonia.<br/><br>
<br/><br>
The thesis focuses on one of the major linguistic expansions in pre-Columbian South America, that of the Arawak language family. It identifies some of the cultural mechanisms in the interaction between Arawak- and non-Arawak-speaking societies, emphasizing the role of regional integration through long-distance travel and trade. The ambition is to transcend notions of bounded and essentialized ethnic identities that have characterized earlier attempts to account for the spatial distribution of indigenous languages and varieties of material culture. Emphasis is rather on the various factors that have conditioned active processes of ethnic identity construction, and on the methodological possibilities of identifying such conditions and processes at specific points in time and space.},
