\addchap{Preface}
\noindent This book is dedicated to the memory of the German linguist Ilse Zimmermann (1928–2020). She was a proliferous scholar; among her publications are many articles of outstanding importance. Researchers from various countries and theoretical backgrounds regarded her as one of the leading scholars in the field of linguistics.

The book presents examples of Ilse Zimmermann’s work as well as articles by colleagues elaborating on topics closely related to Zimmermann’s own linguistic interests.

Not all of Zimmermann’s articles were published in world-wide accessible books or journals. Some appeared behind the “iron curtain”.  In making this book, we did a minimum of editing. We harmonized matters of style, lay-out and linguistic examples, and we updated the references. All footnotes are as in the original; editors’ footnotes are identified as such.

The editors would like to thank the guest authors for their contributions: Boban Arsenijević, Manfred Bierwisch, Joanna Błaszczak, Gisbert Fanselow, Ljudmila Geist, Uwe Junghanns, Hagen Pitsch. We moreover thank the holders of the licenses of the original articles by Zimmermann for permitting reprint. We finally thank the editors of the Open Slavic Linguistics series of Language Science Press.

Above of all we are deeply indebted to Ilse.\bigskip\\
