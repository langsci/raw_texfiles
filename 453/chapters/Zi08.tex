\section{Introduction} \label{sec:zi08:1}
I examine Russian interrogative and exclamative sentences with the attributive wh-pronouns \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} within the framework of the Minimalist Program \citep{zi08:Chomsky1995,Chomsky2004}. As in my treatment of sentence mood \citep{Zimmermann2009}, I assume that the differentiation of sentence types with illocutionary force is anchored syntactically and semantically in the functional head C. Phrases containing \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} are attracted to SpecCP. I will argue that the meaning of these pronouns is integrated into the semantic form of the corresponding utterances in situ and that it consists of a parameter (variable) which will be bound by the semantics of С. I will discuss how \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} are built into the syntax of the DP structure and how they relate to determiners. I will account for the fact that it is possible to answer questions like \textit{Kakuju/Čto za knigu on čitaet}? `Which/What kind of book is he reading?' not only by specific predicate expressions like \textit{interesnuju} `an interesting one', \textit{о revoljucii} `one about the revolution', etc., but also by terms like \textit{istoričeskij roman} `a historical novel', \textit{Vojna i mir} `\textit{War and Peace}', etc. I hope to shed light on the syntactic and semantic analysis of \textit{čto za}, a borrowed expression, with respect to compositionality and the external behavior of the container DP. I will also address the stylistic distribution of expressions with \textit{kakoj} vs. \textit{čto za}.

\section{The data} \label{sec:zi08:2}

Contemporary Russian interrogative and exclamative sentences are characterized by special intonation and word order and/or lexical means, which contribute by their semantics to the respective sentence type. The pronominal entities \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} serve this aim. They occur as components of noun phrases at the left periphery of exclamative or interrogative sentences.

% example 1
\ea \label{ex:zi08:1}
    \gll Kakoj prekrasnyj den' segodnja!\\
    what nice day today\\
    \glt `What a nice day it is today!'
\z

% example 2
\ea \label{ex:zi08:2}
    \gll Čto za jubilej zdes' otmečajut?\\
    what for anniversary here is-being-celebrated\\
    \glt `What anniversary is being celebrated here?'
\z

\noindent Russian allows the separation of the pronominal \textit{kakoj} and the pronominal component \textit{čto} of \textit{čto za} from their DP.

% example 3
\ea \label{ex:zi08:3}
    \gll Kakaja ėto reka?\\
    which this river\\
    \glt `What river is this?'
\z

% example 4
\ea \label{ex:zi08:4}
    \gll Čto ėto za reka?\\
    what this for river\\
    \glt `What river is this?'
\z

\noindent The integration of \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} into the DP structure must account for this possibility.

\textit{Čto za} seems to prefer negative qualifications of the pertinent referent, where\-as \textit{kakoj} is neutral in this regard.{\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:1}For sentences \REF{ex:zi08:5}--\REF{ex:zi08:6} and \REF{ex:zi08:39} I thank E. Gorishneva (p.c.).}}

% example 5
\ea \label{ex:zi08:5}
    \gll Čto ona za ženščina! Nastojaščaja zmeja! / \minsp{??} Umnica, krasavica!\\
    what she for woman real snake {} {} clever-girl beauty\\
    \glt `What a woman she is! A real snake!/A clever girl, a beauty!'
\z

% example 6
\ea \label{ex:zi08:6}
    Kakaja ona ženščina! Umnica, krasavica! /  Nastojaščaja zmeja!
\z

\noindent But \REF{ex:zi08:7}--\REF{ex:zi08:9} show that \textit{čto za} is compatible with positive characterizations of the referent as well.

% example 7
\ea \label{ex:zi08:7}
    \gll Kakoj / čto za čudesnyj čelovek moj drug!\\
    what {} what for wonderful person my friend\\
    \glt `What a wonderful person my friend is!'
    
\z

% example 8
\ea \label{ex:zi08:8}
    \gll Čto za prelest' ėti skazki!\\
    what for treasure these fairy-tales\\
    \glt `What a treasure these fairy-tales are!' \xspace\hfill(Google)
\z

% example 9
\ea \label{ex:zi08:9}
    \gll Čto ona za ženščina! Čto za aktrisa! No kak ona živet!\\
    what she for woman what for actress but how she lives\\
    \glt `What a woman she is! What an actress! But the way she lives!'
    \xspace\hfill(Google)
\z

\noindent In contrast to \textit{kakoj}, the composed expression \textit{čto za}, which is borrowed from Germanic languages and is also used in other Slavic languages, is restricted to colloquial speech. This stylistic restriction does not apply to German \textit{was für ein}. 

Furthermore, \textit{čto za} in Russian — in contrast to German, Bulgarian, and Slovenian\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:2}Compare:

% example (i) in footnote 2
\ea \label{ex:zi08:fn2i}
    \gll Na što za čovek Mitko pomaga!\\
    in what for person Mitko is-helping\\
    \glt `What kind of person Mitko is helping!'
    \xspace\hfill(Bulgarian)
\z

% example (ii) in footnote 2
\ea \label{ex:zi08:fn2ii}
    \gll Na kaj za enem uradu dela?\\
    in what for an office works\\
    \glt `For which office does he work?'
    \xspace\hfill(Slovenian)
\z

} — does not co-occur with prepositions.

% example 10
\ea \label{ex:zi08:10}
    \gll S kakimi / \minsp{*} S čto za ljud'mi {} Maša obščaetsja?\\
    with what {} {} with what for people {} Masha has-contact\\
    \glt `What kind of people does Masha have contact with?'
\z

% example 11
\ea \label{ex:zi08:11}
    \gll Za kakogo / \minsp{*} Za čto za čeloveka Maša vyšla zamuž?\\
    for what {} {} for what for man Masha went for-husband\\
    \glt `What kind of man did Masha marry?'
\z

\noindent Moreover, the overwhelming majority of examples with \textit{čto za} I have seen are in nominative or accusative noun phrases. Oblique cases are exceptions, at least in Russian. Here are some examples:\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:3}Example \REF{ex:zi08:12} is the only example from 97 pages of Google citations in which \textit{čto za} shows up in a noun phrase with an oblique case.}

% example 12
\ea \label{ex:zi08:12}
    \gll Čto za erundoj ej moročili golovu!\\
    what for nonsense.\textsc{inst} her.\textsc{dat} turned head\\
    \glt `What nonsense they filled her head with!'
    \xspace\hfill(Google)%\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:3}This is the only example from 97 pages of Google citations in which \textit{čto za} shows up in a noun phrase with an oblique case.}
\z

% example 13
\ea \label{ex:zi08:13}
    \gll Čto za čeloveku on doveril svoju naxodku?\\
    what for person.\textsc{dat} he trusted-with his finding\\
    \glt `What kind of person did he trust with his finding?'
    \xspace\hfill\citep{Israeli2006}
\z

% example 14
\ea \label{ex:zi08:14}
    \gll Čto za celej Boris xočet dostič'?\\
    what for aims.\textsc{gen} Boris wants to-achieve\\
    \glt `What goals does Boris want to achieve?'
\z

\noindent These co-occurrence restrictions must somehow be accounted for in a descriptively adequate grammar of Russian. For the present I cannot offer any explanation.

Whereas \textit{kakoj} morphosyntactically behaves like an adjective, \textit{čto za} does not agree with the head noun in gender, number, or case (see the examples above). It is an uninflected composite expression. Its components also behave strangely. \textit{Za} does not function as a preposition: it does not assign case. (At least not in Russian; in Czech \textit{za} can assign the accusative to the head noun, as in \textit{Co je to za knihu/kniha?} `What kind of book.\textsc{acc}/book.\textsc{nom} is this?'.) Furthermore, in Russian the wh-word \textit{čto} of the composed expression \textit{čto za} does not combine with specificity markers like \textit{kое-}, \textit{-to}, or \textit{-libo}.

% example 15
\ea \label{ex:zi08:15}
    \gll Ja tebe koe-čto / {} koe-kakoj podarok / \minsp{*} koe-čto za podarok prinesla.\\
    I you something {} {} some present {} {} some-what for present have-brought\\
    \glt `I have brought you something (nice)/some (nice) present.'
\z

\noindent Both \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} function as modifiers which introduce a semantic parameter, i.e., an unspecified predicate. This predicate refers to properties or gradations. In addition to the examples \REF{ex:zi08:1} and \REF{ex:zi08:7} with adjectival modifiers, the following exclamation shows that nouns like \textit{sčast'e} `luck', \textit{radost'} `joy', \textit{čudo} `miracle', \textit{razočarovanie} `disappointment', \textit{erunda} `nonsense', \textit{durak} `idiot', and \textit{krasavica} `beauty' also express gradable qualifications.

% example 16
\ea \label{ex:zi08:16}
    \gll Kakое / {} Čto za \minsp{(} bol'šoe) udovol'stvie bylo naše putešestvie!\\
    what {} {} what for {} great pleasure was our journey\\
    \glt `What a (great) pleasure our journey was!'
\z

\noindent In many cases (compare \REF{ex:zi08:2}--\REF{ex:zi08:4}), \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} seem to function like determiners which convert a predicate of type $\langle e,t \rangle$ into a term of type $\langle e \rangle$ or $\langle \langle e,t \rangle ,t \rangle $.\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:4}The determiner function of \textit{kakoj} prevails when the particles \textit{koe-}, \textit{-to}, or \textit{-libo} are added (see \citealt{Kagan2007}).}

In the analysis below I will try to account for these semantic peculiarities of \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za}.

But first, a short comparison with German might be useful. I will concentrate on the use of \textit{welch} (\textit{ein}), \textit{welcher}, and \textit{was für ein} (see \citealt{Engel1988} and \citealt{Bhatt1990}). 

\textit{Welch} (\textit{ein}) is restricted to exclamative sentences. \textit{Welch} is the uninflected part of the composite pronoun. \textit{Ein} can be omitted when it is not inflected.

% example 17
\ea \label{ex:zi08:17}
    \gll Welch (ein) Vergnügen / Welch einen Spaß wir bei Dieter hatten!\\
    which a pleasure {} which a fun we at Dieter had\\
    \glt `What pleasure/What fun we had at Dieter's!'
\z

\noindent Plural DPs with \textit{welch} have a zero article and occur only with inflected attributes.

% example 18
\ea \label{ex:zi08:18}
    \gll Welch \minsp{*(} schöne) Blumen er bekommen hat!\\
    which {} beautiful flowers he received has\\
    \glt `What nice flowers he got!'
\z

\noindent \textit{Welcher} is a selective determiner and refers to alternative individuals of a given set, whereas \textit{was für ein} refers to properties.

% example 19
\ea \label{ex:zi08:19}
    \gll Welcher Koffer gehört Ihnen?\\
    which suitcase belong you.\textsc{dat}\\
    \glt `Which suitcase belongs to you?'
\z

% example 20
\ea \label{ex:zi08:20}
    \gll Was für einen Koffer haben Sie verloren?\\
    what for a suitcase have you lost\\
    \glt `What kind of suitcase did you lose?'
\z

\noindent Admittedly, the lines of differentiation here are fuzzy, but I will not go into details.

Like Russian \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za}, German \textit{welcher} and \textit{was für ein} occur in interrogative and exclamative sentences.

Like the \textit{čto} of the composite expression \textit{čto za}, the corresponding German pronominal component \textit{was} of \textit{was für ein} can be separated from the DP.

% example 21
\ea \label{ex:zi08:21}
    \gll Was möchten Sie für einen Koffer kaufen?\\
    what like you for a suitcase buy\\
    \glt `What kind of suitcase would you like to buy?'
\z

\noindent In contrast to Russian \textit{čto za}, German \textit{was für ein} can be used in DPs of all cases, with or without a preposition.

% example 22
\ea \label{ex:zi08:22}
    \gll Mit was für einem Buch könnte ich dich erfreuen?\\
    with what for a book could I you please\\
    \glt `What kind of book would please you?'
\z

\noindent German requires that the indefinite article within the composed pronoun \textit{was für ein} agree with the noun in gender, number, and case. Russian does not have explicit articles. When the noun phrase is absent, the plural form of the German indefinite article \textit{ein} is suppleted by \textit{welche}.

% example 23
\ea \label{ex:zi08:23}
    \gll Was für Bücher / was für welche bevorzugen Sie?\\
    what for books {} what for which prefer you\\
    \glt `What kind of books/which ones do you prefer?'
\z

\noindent In contrast to \textit{was für ein}/\textit{was für welche}, \textit{welcher} can be used as an indefinite determiner.

% example 24
\ea \label{ex:zi08:24}
    \gll Wir brauchen zum Gartenfest viele Stühle. Können Sie welche /\hspace{.7cm} \minsp{*} was für welche mitbringen?\\
    we need for garden-party many chairs can you some {} %*
    {} what for some bring-with\\
    \glt `We need a lot of chairs for the garden party. Can you bring some with you?'
\z

\noindent In view of these Russian and German data, the following analysis is proposed to account for the polyfunctionality of \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za}, for the case restrictions of \textit{čto za}, and for the separability of \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto} from their DP.

\section{The analysis} \label{sec:zi08:3}

% sub-section 3.1
\subsection{The left periphery} \label{subsec3.1}

Russian phrases with \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} or the pronouns \textit{kakoj} or \textit{čto} alone appear at the left periphery of interrogative, exclamative, and relative clauses. This is also true in many other languages. In line with my morphosyntactic analysis of Russian wh-pronouns and adverbials like \textit{kto} `who' or \textit{kogda} `when' \citep{zi08:Zimmermann2000} and my treatment of sentence mood \citep{Zimmermann2009}, I assume that wh-phrases are attracted to the left periphery of their clauses by a $+$wh-feature of the functional category С at the top of root and embedded clauses, which are differentiated by the feature [$\pm$force].\footnote{Editors' note: \citet{Zimmermann2009} was referred to as Zimmermann (forthcoming) in the original text.} Exclamative sentences have the feature [$+$exclam], whereas interrogative sentences are characterized by [$+$quest]. These features correspond to the semantic interpretation of the zero complementizer C.

% example 25
\ea \label{ex:zi08:25} $/\varnothing/$;\,$+$C, $\alpha$force, $+$wh, $+$exclam; $\lambda P\,(\textsc{exclam})_{\alpha}\, \exists ! X [P\, X]\,\textsc{exclam} \in\,\langle t,a \rangle , P \in\,\langle \beta,t \rangle , \beta \in\,\{e, t, \langle e,t \rangle \}$
\z

% example 26
\ea \label{ex:zi08:26} $/\varnothing/$;\,+C, $\alpha$force, +wh, +quest; $\lambda P\,(\textsc{quest})_{\alpha}\, ? X [P\, X]\,\textsc{quest} \in\,\langle t,a \rangle , P \in\,\langle \beta,t \rangle , \beta \in\,\{e, t, \langle e,t \rangle \}$
\z

\noindent It is important that the Semantic Form (SF) of the complement of С constitutes an open proposition with an unbound variable which is only bound by the semantics of C. In exclamative $+$wh-sentences this variable is bound by the definite existential operator $\exists !X$ corresponding to the iota-operator \citep{zi08:Zybatow1990,Rosengren1992,Brandt-Reis-etal1992}. In interrogative $+$wh-sentences the binder of the variable is the question operator $?X$ characterizing the openness of the respective proposition (cf. \citealt{Brandt-Reis-etal1992}). In addition, root sentences are mapped by the sentence-mood operator \textsc{exclam} or \textsc{quest} to speech act types (cf. \citealt{zi08:Krifka2001}).

In this respect, my analysis of С departs from \citet{Brandt-Reis-etal1992}, \citet{zi08:Reis1999}, \citet{dAvis2002}, \citet{Zanuttini-Portner2003}, and \citet{Abels2007}, who do not assume any element in syntax responsible for introducing illocutionary force characterizations. According to \citet{Zimmermann2009}, every root clause adds to the common ground a proposition and a set of communicative commitments associated with the respective force type.\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:5}Whereas interrogative clauses denote a set of alternatives specifying the variable bound by the question operator, exclamative clauses widen the domain of quantification for the wh-operator. This aspect of meaning derives from the exclamative-force operator or from the corresponding embedding predicate. (For the concept of widening and the relation of exclamatives to scales of expectedness, see \citealt[49ff.]{Zanuttini-Portner2003}) Likewise the factive presupposition which is associated with exclamative clauses is not represented in syntax -- as \citet{Zanuttini-Portner2003} propose -- but derives from the embedded predicate or from the exclamative force operator of root clauses.}

The treatment of sentence mood as in \REF{ex:zi08:25} and \REF{ex:zi08:26} implies that there is no need for the movement of wh-phrases to the left periphery at the level of Logical Form (LF). The appearance of wh-phrases at the left periphery is a surface matter. The $+$wh-phrases move cyclically, from syntactic phase to syntactic phase (see \citealt{zi08:Chomsky1995,Chomsky2004}). They are attracted to SpecCP by the feature $+$wh in С (see \REF{ex:zi08:25}--\REF{ex:zi08:26}).

Semantically,  wh-phrases are interpreted in situ. Their semantics introduce the unbound variable as a parameter which is specified by appropriate answers to the question involved or by the conceptual representation of individual terms or specific predicates on the level of Conceptual Structure (CS), depending on the shared knowledge of hearers and speakers and/or the situational context. This assumption corresponds to the analysis of exclamative sentences by \citet{zi08:Zybatow1990} and is in accord with the treatment of the Dutch \textit{was} (\textit{voor}) (\textit{een}) constructions by \citet{Bennis1995} and \citet{Bennis-Corver-etal1998}.

% sub-section 3.2
\subsection{On the syntax and semantics of \textit{kakoj}} \label{subsec3.2}

The syntactic structure of phrases containing \textit{kakoj} must account for its semantic functions, for the separability of the pronoun from its noun phrase, for its agreement in gender, number, and case with the head noun, and for its movement to the specifier position of С (SpecCP). Semantically, the analysis must guarantee the introduction of a predicate or individual variable. 

As for syntax, I assume the following structures:

% example 27
\ea \label{ex:zi08:27} [\textsubscript{NP} [\textsubscript{AP}\,\textit{kakoj}] NP]
\z

% example 28
\ea \label{ex:zi08:28} [\textsubscript{DP} [\textsubscript{D}\,$\varnothing$][\textsubscript{NP} [\textsubscript{AP}\,\textit{kakoj}] NP]]
\z

\noindent In \REF{ex:zi08:27} \textit{kakoj} is represented as adjunct to NP, and in \REF{ex:zi08:28} the DP layer with a zero head in D is added. 

\textit{Kakoj} as a lexical entry is characterized by the following morphosyntactic and semantic features:

% example 29
\ea \label{ex:zi08:29} /kakoj/; $+$N$+$V, $+$wh; $(\lambda Q) \lambda x [Q x]$
\z

\noindent I consider \textit{kakoj} an adjective phrase which is characterized as a $+$wh-entity. Semantically, it has a dual character. The predicate variable $Q$ can function as a parametrical modifier of the noun phrase or it can be specified by the predicate expressed by the head NP. These two possibilities are illustrated in \REF{ex:zi08:31} and \REF{ex:zi08:32}.

% example 30
\ea \label{ex:zi08:30} \cnst{MOD} = $\lambda Q_1 \lambda Q_2 \lambda x [[Q_1\, x] \wedge [Q_2 x]]$
\z

% example 31
\ea \label{ex:zi08:31} \sib{\textit{kakaja kniga}} $=$ \cnst{MOD} ($\lambda x [\textsc{book}\, x])(\lambda x [Q\, x])$\\
$\equiv \lambda x [[\textsc{book}\, x] \wedge [Q\, x]]$ 
\z

\noindent The semantic template  \cnst{MOD} in \REF{ex:zi08:30} (see \citealt{Zimmermann1992}) combines the modifier with the meaning of the head noun. As for agreement, I assume that an adjectival modifier like \textit{kakoj} and what it modifies must agree in case, number, and gender. This is to say that the specified morphosyntactic features associated with the external argument of the respective predicates must coincide. 

In \REF{ex:zi08:32} the semantic contribution of \textit{kakoj} is an identity function.

% example 32
\ea \label{ex:zi08:32} \sib{\textit{kakaja kniga}} $= \lambda Q \lambda x [Q\, x](\lambda x [\textsc{book}\, x])$\\
$\equiv \lambda x [\textsc{book}\, x]$
\z

\noindent In combination with the semantics of the determiner we obtain \REF{ex:zi08:33} and \REF{ex:zi08:34}. In \REF{ex:zi08:33}, D is categorized by $+$Det $-$wh, while in \REF{ex:zi08:34} by $+$Det $+$wh.

% example 33
\ea \label{ex:zi08:33} \sib{$\varnothing$}\,(\sib{NP}) $= \lambda P_1 \lambda P_2 \exists x [[P_1 x] \wedge [P_2\, x]](\lambda x [[\textsc{book}\, x] \wedge [Q\, x]])$\\
$\equiv \lambda P_2 \exists x [[[\textsc{book}\, x] \wedge [Q\, x]] \wedge [P_2 x]]$
\z

% example 34
\ea \label{ex:zi08:34} \sib{$\varnothing$}\,(\sib{NP}) $= \lambda P_1 \lambda P_2 [[P_1\, x] \wedge [P_2\, x]](\lambda x [\textsc{book}\, x])$\\
$\equiv \lambda P_2 [[\textsc{book}\, x] \wedge [P_2\, x]]$
\z

\noindent In the last case the predicate variable $Q$ is absent and \textit{kakaja kniga} is interpreted like \textit{kto} (\citealt{zi08:Zimmermann2000}; see also \citealt[145]{Paul1958}).

% example 35
\ea \label{ex:zi08:35} \sib{\textit{kto}} $= \lambda P_2 [[\textsc{animate}\, x] \wedge [P_2\, x]]$
\z

\noindent Thus the semantics of \textit{kakoj} as given in \REF{ex:zi08:29} brings in the parameter $Q$ or enables the NP to get its external argument $\lambda$x blocked by a $+$wh-determiner. The free variables, $Q$ and $x$, are bound by the semantics of С depending on the respective clause type, as in \REF{ex:zi08:36}--\REF{ex:zi08:39}.

% example 36
\ea \label{ex:zi08:36}
    \gll Kakie knigi vy predpočitaete, populjarnye ili xudožestvennye?\\
    what books you prefer popular or art\\
    \glt `What kind of books do you prefer, popular or literary?'
\z

% example 37
\ea \label{ex:zi08:37}
    \gll Kakie reki vpadajut v Volgu?\\
    which rivers flow into Volga\\
    \glt `Which rivers flow into the Volga?'
\z

% example 38
\ea \label{ex:zi08:38}
    \gll Kakie u vas est' interesnye knigi!\\
    what by you are interesting books\\
    \glt `What interesting books you have!'
\z

% example 39
\ea \label{ex:zi08:39}
    \gll Kakim prekrasnym pedagogom ty stal!\\
    what good teacher you have-become\\
    \glt `What a good teacher you have become!'
\z

\noindent In the last example, the phrase with \textit{kakoj} is a predicate expression, an NP without the DP layer. Moreover, \textit{kakoj} here refers to a high degree of the property expressed by the adjective \textit{prekrasnyj}. The same is true in the example \REF{ex:zi08:40}, from \citet{zi08:Zybatow1990}.

% example 40
\ea \label{ex:zi08:40}
    \gll Kakoj krepkij čaj vy svarili!\\
    what strong tea you have-made\\
    \glt `What a strong tea you have made!'

\noindent In these cases, another template, \cnst{MOD'}, is activated in order to combine the parameter Q introduced by \textit{kakoj} with the semantics of its container NP. This template integrates modifiers like \textit{očen'} `very' into the semantics of their gradable modifiees, as in [\textsc{dp} $\varnothing$ [\textsubscript{NP} [\textsubscript{AP} \textit{očen' krepkij}][\textsubscript{NP} \textit{čaj}]]].

% example 41
\ea \label{ex:zi08:41} \cnst{MOD'} $= \lambda Q_1 \lambda Q_2 \lambda x \exists d [[Q_1 d\, x] \wedge [Q_2\, d]]$
\z

\noindent In \REF{ex:zi08:39} and \REF{ex:zi08:40} the pronominal adjective \textit{kakoj} does not figure within the adjective phrase together with the adjective semantically modified by it. For cases like \REF{ex:zi08:40} I assume the syntactic configuration [\textsubscript{DP} $\varnothing$ [\textsubscript{NP} [\textsubscript{AP} \textit{kakoj}][\textsubscript{NP} [\textsubscript{AP} \textit{krepkij}][\textsubscript{NP} \textit{čaj}]]]]. The semantic amalgamation for the complex NP proceeds as follows:

% example 42
\ea \label{ex:zi08:42} \sib{\textit{kakoj krepkij čaj}}\\
$=$ (\cnst{MOD} ($\lambda x  [\textsc{tea}\, x])(\cnst{MOD'} (\lambda d \lambda x [\textsc{strong}\, d\, x])))(\lambda x [Q\, x])$\\ 
\hspace{41pt} $=$ \sib{\textit{čaj}} \hspace{55pt} $=$ \sib{\textit{krepkij}} \hspace{35pt} $=$ \sib{\textit{kakoj}}\\ 
$\equiv \lambda Q_2 \lambda x [[\textsc{tea}\, x] \wedge \exists d [[\textsc{strong}\, d\, x] \wedge [Q_2\, d]]](\lambda x [Q\, x])$\\ 
$\equiv \lambda x [[\textsc{tea}\, x] \wedge \exists d [[\textsc{strong}\, d\, x] \wedge [Q\, d]]]$
\z

\noindent The enriched argument structure of the AP \textit{krepkij} is inherited by the modified NP \textit{krepkij čaj} so that \textit{kakoj} as a predicate expression can come into play at this rather remote level of syntactic structure.

Thus \textit{kakoj} in its function as modifier gets a syntactic and semantic analysis which applies uniformly to cases like \REF{ex:zi08:36} and \REF{ex:zi08:40}. The templates in \REF{ex:zi08:30} and \REF{ex:zi08:41} are necessary for independent reasons. I think it is worthwhile to reduce syntax and to exploit the capacities of semantics.

\subsection{Consequences for the analysis of the colloquial expression \textit{čto za}} \label{subsec3.3}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:zi08:2}, \textit{za} does not function as a preposition. It is a semantically empty annex to NP. In contrast to German, Dutch, and Slovenian, the Russian pronominal expression \textit{čto za} lacks an explicit determiner. I propose an analysis which is quite similar to the one given in the preceding section for \textit{kakoj}.

% example 43
\ea \label{ex:zi08:43} [\textsubscript{DP} [\textsubscript{D} $\varnothing$][\textsubscript{NP} [\textsubscript{NP} \textit{čto}][\textsubscript{NP} \textit{za} ([\textsubscript{NP} AP)[\textsubscript{NP} \textit{kniga}](])]]]
\z

\noindent The semantic burden of the composite expression \textit{čto za} is assigned to \textit{čto}.

% example 44
\ea \label{ex:zi08:44}
    \sib{\textit{čto}} $= (\lambda Q)_\alpha \lambda x [Q x](\lambda x \exists y [[\cnst{kind}\, x\, y] \wedge [Q y]])_\beta$\\
    with $\beta = + \rightarrow \alpha = +$\\
	\ea{ \label{ex:zi08:44a}
    $= \lambda x \exists y [[\textsc{kind}\, x\, y] \wedge [Q y]]$\\
    }
	\ex{ \label{ex:zi08:44b}
    $= \lambda x [Q x]$\\
    }
    \ex{ \label{ex:zi08:44c}
    $= \lambda Q \lambda x [Q x]$
    }
	\z
\z

\noindent The only semantic difference between \textit{čto za} and \textit{kakoj} consists in the facultative presence of the reference to kinds in the case of \textit{čto za}.\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:6}Cf. \citeauthor{Pafel1991} (\citeyear{Pafel1991,Pafel1996b,Pafel1996a}) for German \textit{was für} (\textit{ein}). In contrast to his analysis, I regard the reference to kinds as one possible interpretation and as a modifier to the head NP.}

% example 45
\ea \label{ex:zi08:45}
    \gll Čto za knigu ty čitaeš?\\
         what for book you read\\
    \glt `Which/what kind of book are you reading?'
	\ea{ \label{ex:zi08:45a}
    \gll Ljubovnyj roman.\\
         love story\\
    \glt `A love story.'
    }
	\ex{ \label{ex:zi08:45b}
    \gll О revoljucii.\\
         about revolution\\
    \glt `One about the revolution.'
    }
    \ex{ \label{ex:zi08:45c}
    \gll \textit{Vojna} \textit{i} \textit{mir.}\\
         war and peace\\
    \glt `\textit{War and peace.}'
    }
	\z
\z

\noindent The three possible answers to the question in \REF{ex:zi08:45} correspond to the three meaning variants of \textit{čto za}: (a) reference to kinds; (b) specification of $Q$ as predicate variable in the modifier $[Q x]$ (cf. \REF{ex:zi08:33}); and (c) specification of $x$ as individual variable in $\lambda P_2 \,[[\textsc{book}\, x] \wedge [P_2 \, x]]$ (cf. \REF{ex:zi08:34}).

The lexical entry for \textit{čto} in \textit{čto za} has to account for its peculiar combinability: the co-occurrence with \textit{za}, the lack of occurrence within preposition phrases, and the lack of enrichment by specificity markers like \textit{koe-}, \textit{-to}, \textit{-libo}.\footnote{\label{fn:zi08:7}In contrast to \textit{čto} in \textit{čto za}, the pronoun \textit{kakoj} — like other wh-pronouns and adverbs — can be enriched by specificity markers. They characterize conventional implicatures concerning various types of specificity or non-specificity (see \citealt{Kagan2007}). The wh-pronouns and adverbs by themselves are neutral in this respect \citep{zi08:Zimmermann2000}. I assume that the particles \textit{koe-}, \textit{-to}, \textit{-libo}, \textit{ne-}, \textit{ni-} have their base position in D and combine with the right wh-neighbor and also with a preceding preposition in PF. Thus \textit{ni s kem} `with nobody', \textit{koe s kem} `with a certain person', \textit{dlja kakogo-to studenta} `for some student' will have the base structures \REF{ex:zi08:fn8i} and \REF{ex:zi08:fn8ii}, respectively:

% example (i) in footnote 8
\ea \label{ex:zi08:fn8i} [\textsubscript{PP} [\textsubscript{P} \textit{s}][\textsubscript{DP} [\textsubscript{D} \textit{ni/koe}][\textsubscript{NP} \textit{kem}]]]
\z

% example (ii) in footnote 8
\ea \label{ex:zi08:fn8ii} [\textsubscript{PP} [\textsubscript{P} \textit{dlja}][\textsubscript{DP} [\textsubscript{D} \textit{to}][\textsubscript{NP} [\textsubscript{AP} \textit{kakogo}][\textsubscript{NP} \textit{studenta}]]]]
\z

\noindent Editors' note: A later version of \textcite{Kagan2007} has been published as \textcite{Kagan2011}.
} Furthermore, \textit{čto} in \textit{čto za} is uninflectible and does not show any agreement with the head NP, in contrast to the AP \textit{kakoj}. Like \textit{kakoj}, \textit{čto} can leave its container phrase and appear at the left periphery of the sentence. The peculiarities have to be worked out.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:zi08:4}

The inspection of the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of the Russian pronouns \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} has brought me to important conclusions on the division of labor between syntax and semantics in the mutual correlation of sound and meaning. I have utilized current work within the framework of Minimalism and taken note of the differentiation between the Semantic Form of linguistic expressions, which is grammatically determined, and their Conceptual Structure, which has to do with world knowledge (see \citealt{zi08:Bierwisch-Lang1987}, \citealt{zi08:Bierwisch2007}). I have taken templates like \cnst{MOD} and \cnst{MOD'} (see \REF{ex:zi08:30} and \REF{ex:zi08:41}) to be considered as universal components of the semantic interpretation. But discussion of their status in comparison with corresponding functional zero heads in the syntactic representation goes beyond the limits of this paper.

My analysis of Russian wh-pronouns and adverbs \citep{zi08:Zimmermann2000} has shown how phrases with \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} get an unbound variable in their base position. I believe the multifunctionality of wh-words can best be captured by taking into account the various syntactic domains of referential specification (binding) of entities in situ, in the middle field, or in the CP domain (cf. \citealt{Postma1994,Postma1995}). I have shown the interplay of unbound variables of various semantic types with the semantics of sentence mood (see also \citealt{Zimmermann2009}). The existence of semantic parameters (variables) introduced by the semantics of \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} gives broad room for the conceptual interpretation of the relevant clauses.

% example 46
\ea \label{ex:zi08:46}
    \gll Kakaja ona ženščina!\\
    what she woman\\
    \glt `What a woman she is!'
\z

\noindent This exclamation, in the context of a volume honoring an outstanding linguist, is immediately understood as high estimation.


I hope that my treatment of the Russian pronouns \textit{kakoj} and \textit{čto za} and of the correlation of form and meaning can be applied to the corresponding expressions of other languages as well.
