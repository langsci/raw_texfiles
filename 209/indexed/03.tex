\section{Introduction} 
Computer-assisted \isi{interpreter training} (\textsc{cait}), as a relatively new field in interpreting studies, explores the implementation of information and communication technologies (\textsc{ict}) in the training of interpreters. Currently very little, if any research has been conducted on \textsc{cait} within the South African context. International research on \textsc{cait} and its application in the development of self-assessment skills has focused mainly on its implementation within institutions of higher learning as a tool in the training of student interpreters. There has been no focus on the possible use in the training and self-assessment of the practicing \isi{interpreter}. These \textsc{cait} tools may also prove useful when utilized for self-assessment skills development within institutions that employ interpreters on a permanent basis.  

The curriculum for training interpreters has seen a significant evolution over the past two decades. The implementation of information and communication technologies (\textsc{ict}) in \isi{interpreter training} is a useful additional tool in the \isi{interpreting curriculum}. \textsc{ict}s provide a variety of tools that can enhance the teaching and learning of interpreting and how trainers go about the process of training potential interpreters. This contention is borne out by the number of scholars who have recently shown an interest in and published texts on the subject. In this regard, the contributions of \citet{Lim2014}, \citet{Pinazo2008}, \citet{Gorm2007}, \citet{Sandrelli2007b}, \citet{Lee2005} and \citet{Sandrelli2015, Sandrelli2007b, Sandrelli2002} are relevant. The aforementioned studies led to insights that the implementation of computer-assisted \isi{interpreter training} (\textsc{cait}) in the training of interpreters may be desirable and an appropriate addition to traditional training methods as it holds a number of advantages for both the trainee and the trainer. One of the main advantages highlighted in these studies is the shift towards and emphasis on learner autonomy. 

The aforementioned studies were conducted within the context of implementation in the \isi{interpreting curriculum} and the training of student interpreters at institutions of higher learning. However, these tools may also prove useful when utilized by \isi{freelance} professional interpreters and within institutions that employ professional interpreters on a permanent basis. This study poses the question whether these \textsc{cait} tools are effective in the development of self-assessment skills in the \isi{professional interpreter}. This question was approached by utilizing the \textsc{cait} software, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}\footnote{In 2002, Melissi Multimedia Ltd. (\textsc{uk}) collaborated with the University of Hull (\textsc{uk}) on the design of a digital language laboratory. As part of this development, a dedicated \isi{interpreter training} module, called \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, was included. The software \textit{\isi{Black Box}} was developed as a commercial product by Melissi Ltd. in 2005.}, within a professional interpreting environment chosen as the Interpreting Unit of the National \isi{Parliament} of South Africa. The effectiveness of this training software as a self-assessment skills development tool for practicing interpreters was evaluated. 

In the context of the latter area of interest, this article presents research conducted on the utilization of \textsc{cait} as a tool for the development of self-assessment skills in professional interpreters. The article is organized as follows: firstly, the rationale concerning self-assessment and computer-assisted \isi{interpreter training} is highlighted; secondly, an overview of the methodology is provided; thereafter the results pertaining to the hypotheses are discussed.

\section{Theoretical background: Self-assessment and \textsc{cait}}

In this section, information is provided on self-assessment in interpreting, com\-puter-assisted \isi{interpreter training} and background on the professional interpret\-er.

\subsection{Self-assessment in interpreting}\label{sec:deysel:2.1}

\citet[74]{Regehr1996} define self-assessment as the ability of each individual to identify his or her own relative strengths and weaknesses. They also offered a reconceptualization of self-assessment that shifted from a focus on the individual’s ability to rate themselves relative to their peers and moved on to explore the ability of the individual to identify their own strengths and weaknesses relative to each other. It is suggested that the ability to identify areas of performance that require the greatest degree of improvement would lend greater efficiency to self-directed learning efforts.

\citet{Riccardi2002} states that the training period is of key importance for introducing future interpreters to the habits of recognizing their strengths and weaknesses. Interpreter training courses are intensive in nature and training is complimented by additional self-study hours. However, self-study hours as in the case of experiential learning bear the risk of being of little use if there is no reflection upon the experience. \citet[4]{Sandrelli2007a} state in this regards that “if unsupervised practice sessions are to be useful, students need to be able to assess their own performance and identify their weaknesses. Indeed, the development of self-assessment skills is an essential component of \isi{interpreter training}”. 

There is agreement in the research by \citet[197]{Pinazo2008} when contending that the training period is vital for introducing interpreters to self-assessment skills and that the integration of self-assessment skills will also have positive effects on learners’ attitudes to self-criticism and performance. 

\citet[254]{Fowler2007} emphasizes the importance of self-assessment skills in interpreting when she explains that after training most interpreters remain isolated throughout their professional lives and the process of monitoring is likely to be left to the interpreters themselves. If the \isi{interpreter} is not self-aware, and has neither skill to be able to assess or evaluate their own performance nor take action to improve upon weaknesses, the service user will suffer the consequences. She elaborates that self-assessment in \isi{interpreter training} therefore fosters good professional habits in the \isi{interpreter}. This is also mentioned by \citet[3]{Lee2005} when he states that “self-assessment is not only important during the training phase of interpretation, but it is critical to professional interpreters as well”. He further explains that “\isi{freelance} interpreters are often left to check their own \isi{interpretation quality} and find measures for improvement” \citep[2]{Lee2005}. The research from \citet[15]{Sandrelli2007a} has also highlighted that “self-assessment skills and the ability to assess other interpreters’ performances are essential for trainees, both to ensure progress and to maintain quality standards in their future careers as professional interpreters”.

The research conducted on the subject \citep{Riccardi2002,Lee2005,Sandrelli2007a,Fowler2007,Pinazo2008} indicates that the development of self-assessment skills is essential in \isi{interpreter training}. It is concluded that the development of self-assessment skills in the \isi{student interpreter} will allow for the ability of the individual to recognise his or her strengths and weaknesses and apply appropriate coping mechanisms to enhance the parts of their performance that need improvement. The development of these self-assessment skills will foster good professional habits which can be used to monitor their progress and ensure quality standards in the future career of the \isi{professional interpreter}. 

\subsection{Computer-assisted interpreter training}
\citet{Sandrelli2007a} indicate that since the 1990s several independent projects were undertaken that shaped the gradual development of what has come to be known as \textsc{cait}. This development has resulted in the division of \textsc{cait} into what is known as \textit{integrative \textsc{cait}} and \textit{intelligent \textsc{cait}.} \textit{Integrative \textsc{cait}} entails the  implementation of \textsc{ict} in \isi{interpreter training} focused on the creation of digital speech repositories in the form of databases, such as the \textit{Interpreters’ Information System} (\textsc{iris}) developed at the University of Trieste in mid 1990s \citep{Carabelli1997} and \textit{Marius} developed at the University of Granada in 2001 \citep{Pöchhacker1994}. These projects collected digital training materials and streamlined these resources for use by students in self-study sessions. They have been labelled as \textit{integrative \textsc{cait}} -- since a project like this “exploits the integration of audio, video and textual resources to provide students with suitable material for classroom use of self-study” \citep[277]{Sandrelli2007a}. On the other hand, \textit{intelligent \textsc{cait}} involved the development of authoring programs such as \textit{Interpretations} and \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, which enables \isi{interpreter} trainers to create various types of exercises. 

\citet[229]{Berber2010} was one of the first who investigated the use of Information and Communication Technologies in \isi{interpreter training} and elaborated on the use of these tools as means\footnote{The term “means” indicates that the \textsc{ict} tools are used to practice and develop skills -- as opposed to being used for support during or in preparation of actual interpreting.} or pedagogical tools, even though \textsc{ict} does not facilitate interpreting immediately but enhances learning over time. She also integrated the Effort Model \citep{Gile1995} and which of the efforts can be backed up by \textsc{ict}. \citet[237]{Berber2010} concluded that \textsc{ict}s in general support the efforts presented in the Effort Model and that information technology in the form of \isi{interpreter training} tools are specifically aimed at the second effort (production) of Gile’s Effort Model, where the student can “listen to him/herself repeatedly for self-evaluation and improvement of production skills”. In her research, \citet[243]{Berber2010} indicated that the types of \textsc{ict} which are being used for self-training are mainly traditional: booths, language labs, digital recordings, video and audio recordings, internet, \textsc{pc}s, e-learning platforms.\footnote{Specific brands of \isi{equipment} are X-class, Melissi \isi{Black Box}, Sanako, Dialang language tests, \textsc{deya} lab, Trados, Audacity, BNc online and Brähler.}

\textsc{cait} tools include \textsc{cr-rom}s, speech repositories, speech and recording data\-bases and authoring tools such as the software program \textit{\isi{Black Box}}. The aforementioned software program allows \isi{interpreter} trainers to create and develop their own set of interpreting exercises for use by individuals and interpreting students in their own time for their self-study sessions. Research that has been conducted on the topic of \textsc{cait} \citep{Sandrelli2007a,Pinazo2008,Lim2014} indicates that implementing \textsc{cait} in the training of interpreters not only enhances the teaching and learning of interpreting, but also enables the creation of a realistic practice environment in which student interpreters are able to develop their self-assessment skills by listening to their own interpreting and reflect upon it. \citet[252]{Bartlomiejczyk2007} indicates that self-evaluation by means of critically listening to one’s own recorded interpreting has often been suggested as a useful method of quality control. The development of self-assessment skills enables the \isi{student interpreter} to identify strengths and weaknesses, apply appropriate coping strategies and monitor their progress and performance.

In her research, \citet{Sandrelli2007b} discusses the development of the \isi{interpreter training} prototype\textit{, Interpretations}, and how that prototype was improved to become the \textsc{cait} authoring tool known as \textit{\isi{Black Box}}. In 2002, Melissi Multimedia Ltd. (\textsc{uk}) collaborated with the University of Hull (\textsc{uk}) on the design of a digital language laboratory. As part of this development, a dedicated \isi{interpreter training} module, called \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, was included. After interest was shown by \isi{interpreter training} institutions, Melissi Multimedia Ltd decided to develop \textit{\isi{Black Box}} as a stand-alone program, and it was released in March 2005. \textit{\isi{Black Box}} is an authoring program -- this means that the \isi{interpreter} trainer has complete control over the resources contained within the program. The software was developed with a hierarchy of how materials are structured. There may be different courses and each of these courses may contain different modules, which will then each contain different exercises. The software’s authoring function allows the \isi{interpreter} trainer to create these different courses, modules or exercises, which may comprise simultaneous, consecutive (including liaison interpreting) as well as exercises for sight translation. 

The different exercises suggested by the developers are:
% \todo{converted from inline enumeration to list}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item shadowing and closing 
\item paraphrasing 
\item sight translation 
\item simultaneous interpreting 
\item simultaneous interpreting with text 
\item consecutive interpreting 
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Potentially it allows one to compile exercises the way you want them to be, by combining text, video and audio. These are suggested activities that take into account an \isi{interpreter}’s learning path in a specific course. \citet[10]{Sandrelli2007a} also indicated that the \textit{Wizard} makes it possible to add many more resources, including instructions to students, a written translation of the speech, written exercises (comprehension questions, text analysis exercises) and a teacher’s interpreted version of the speech. Teachers can also manipulate the sound stream by adding an echo effect or sound distortion in order to simulate realistic working conditions. The \isi{source text} transcripts can be annotated by adding a hot footnote. Students read the note made by the teacher simply by moving the mouse over the word. In the sight translation exercises the text is presented to students in a scrolling cylinder which advances at the pace established by the teacher. 

\newpage\subsection{The professional interpreter?}
Since this research study focused on the utilization of \textsc{cait} beyond institutions of higher learning in to \isi{interpreting practice}, the term “\isi{professional interpreter}” was often referred to. It was thus deemed necessary to provide a definition of the concept “\isi{professional interpreter}”. Using time as a measure to achieve professional status, in an article by \citet[115]{Sandrelli2015}, reference is made to Moser-Mercer (in \citealt{Motta2006}) who estimates that 3000--5000 hours of deliberate practice are required in order to achieve professional levels of expertise in interpreting. The footnote of the mentioned article indicates that \textsc{aiic} (International Association of Conference Interpreters), admits new members with a minimum of 150 days of work experience.

In her article on \textit{Language practitioners and standards}, \citet[162]{Feinauer2005} states that the characteristics of a profession are “mastery of a particular skill through education and training, acceptance of duties to a broader society than merely one’s clients/employers, objectivity and high standards of conduct and performance”. She goes further and defines the profile of a professional as an individual “trained to recognise standards of competence, adheres to a recognised code of practice and enjoys the support and regulation of a professional structure” all the while stating that professionalism is a relative term. 

In summary, the term “\isi{professional interpreter}” is therefore defined as an \isi{interpreter} presumed to not simply be competent but having mastered their skill with prior experience and/or training in interpreting and adhering to high standards of conduct supported by a code of practice. 

\section{Methodology}
This section provides information regarding the research design, respondents and the methods (questionnaires, experiment and interviews) used to collect the empirical data. 

\subsection{Research design} 
Using the above background as the point of departure, the primary objective of the research was to investigate and evaluate the effectiveness of the \textsc{cait} software, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, in the development of self-assessment skills of professional interpreters in the National \isi{Parliament}\footnote{The National \isi{Parliament} of South Africa makes use of interpreting into the eleven official languages during their sittings as well as Sign Language. The eleven official languages are \ili{Afrikaans}, \ili{English}, \ili{isiNdebele}, \ili{isiXhosa}, \ili{isiZulu}, \ili{Sepedi}, \ili{Sesotho}, \ili{Setswana}, \ili{siSwati}, \ili{Tshivenda}, \ili{Xitsonga}.}  of South Africa. To address the primary research objective as stated, the following secondary research questions were explored:

\begin{itemize}
\item To what extend does training in self-assessment for interpreters give a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of their interpreting?
\item To what extend does training in self-assessment for interpreters give a better understanding of the criteria used in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance}?
\item What is the correlation of the self-assessment ratings between the experimental group and the ratings from the \isi{expert assessor post-experiment}?
\item What is the correlation of the self-assessment ratings between the control group when compared to the experimental \isi{group post-experiment}?
\end{itemize}

The research design most suitable for this study comprised an evaluation study approach, based on an experimental intervention design, i.e. a type of study in which participants are assigned to groups that receive one or other intervention or no intervention so that the effects of the intervention can be evaluated. An intervention research includes studies in which researches follow a systematic change in the condition to determine the effects on a physical capacity, skill or performance. In the evaluation of the effectiveness of the \textsc{cait} software, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, the software was utilized as an intervention in the form of technological innovation in voluntary \isi{in-house training} to support professional interpreters in their professional development. It should be noted here that the \isi{in-house training} formed part of this research study and was not initiated or permanently implemented by the \isi{Parliament} of South Africa. Therefore, the researchers’ personal PC was used in the sessions which has one licensed copy of \textit{\isi{Black Box}}. The participants were exposed to self-assessment sessions on \textit{\isi{Black Box}} in individual sessions where they received the same brief and instructions beforehand. The sessions were conducted during lunch hours in a sound-proof room with two sound-proof doors. 

The empirical study sought to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. This meant that the core method was of a quantitative nature, while the supplementary method was of a qualitative nature, and was used to extend the findings of the quantitative data. The quantitative data was collected from the experiment, which required the interpreters to complete self-assessment grids (see Appendix~\ref{03:addendum:A})
% \todo{Langsci: Check link to addendum} 
in both the control and experimental groups. An investigation by means of a questionnaire (see Appendix~\ref{03:addendum:B}) and interviews (see Appendix~\ref{03:addendum:C}) formed part of the qualitative follow-up to investigate the outcomes from the quantitative data.

It should be emphasized that this is a pilot study as the sample size of respondents is extremely small and may contribute to the data not being statistically significant. To put this into context the following background information should be noted. 

According to Human Resources of National \isi{Parliament} of South Africa \citep{Moorad2017}, 38 language practitioners were employed within the Interpreting Unit at the time of conducting this study. Of these 38 practitioners, three were Sign Language interpreters. These interpreters could not participate in the study, as the software, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, does not make provision for video recording. This left 35 language practitioners available for participation in the study. 

The institutional permission the researcher received from \isi{Parliament} to conduct the research within the Interpreting Unit stipulated that data may only be collected outside of work hours. The researcher agreed to this stipulation, which meant the lunch hour was used for data collection. The experimental part of the study -- that involved the self-training sessions on \textit{\isi{Black Box}} -- would take up to 30 minutes per person per session. With the time allocation for the experiment in mind, the researcher calculated that only five respondents per week could form part of the experiment. A limitation resulting from this agreement is that the researcher observed that collecting data from participants outside of working hours i.e. during their lunch breaks, may discourage some respondents from participating in the study and that reluctance may result in the entire population in the unit of analysis not participating in the data collection. 

When surveying only a sample of the population, researchers have to consider margins of error and confidence levels of the data that is collected: the margin of error is the amount of error which can be tolerated, while the confidence level is the amount of uncertainty that can be tolerated. The margin of error for this study was set at 25\% while the confidence level in the study was set at 90\%. Given the population of 35 possible respondents, the sample size was calculated at nine. 

For this study, it was decided that anything above 26\% as a margin of error would be too high. A margin of error of 25.91\% would mean that eight respondents would form part of the study. The researcher had to bear the possibility of discouragement of some respondents in mind, and thus decided to send the questionnaire to double the amount, resulting in 16 interpreters receiving the link to the questionnaire. Only ten of the 16 respondents had completed the questionnaire.

The experimental method in this study involved:\largerpage[-1]

\begin{itemize}
\item selecting a group of respondents\footnote{The necessary ethical clearance was provided from Stellenbosch University as well as institutional clearance from the \isi{Parliament} of \textsc{sa}. The National Health Research Ethics Committee (\textsc{nhrec}) registration number is \textsc{rec-050411-032}.} who fit into the category of ‘\isi{professional interpreter}’
\item dividing them into an experimental group and a control group using the quota \isi{matching method}
\item exposing the experimental group to a \isi{stimulus} – in this case four self-assessment sessions on \textit{\isi{Black Box}}
\item observing and measuring the effect of the \isi{stimulus} on the respondents. The experiment itself entailed pre- and post-testing of the respondents. The pre-testing tested the respondents to determine their self-assessment skills
\end{itemize}

The experimental group was then exposed to self-assessment sessions which served as the intervention. Finally, post-testing was conducted to determine if the intervention had any impact on the development of self-assessment skills of the interpreters.

\subsection{Respondents}
A sample representative of the population deemed as ‘professional interpreters’ according to the above stated definition was selected as the unit of analysis for the research. For the purpose of the study, the term ‘\isi{professional interpreter}’ was defined as an \isi{interpreter} presumed to not simply be competent but having mastered their skill with prior experience and/or training in interpreting and adhering to high standards of conduct supported by a code of practice. Interpreters who, at the time of the study, were employed full-time within the Interpreting Unit of the Language Services Section at the National \isi{Parliament} of the Republic of South Africa were chosen as the sample population for this study.\footnote{Regarding the recruitment policy of parliament for interpreters, it is suffice to state here that as there is relative short history of interpreting, interpreters were initially recruited from the teaching profession. However, over the last couple of years some inroads have been made as trained interpreters were appointed. These interpreters currently provide for all the 11 official languages as well Sign Language.  Please see \citet{Lesch2010} for information on recruitment and training of parliamentary interpreters.} A week after the link to the questionnaire was sent out via email, ten of the interpreters in the Unit completed the questionnaire and were subsequently divided into the control group (5 respondents) and the experimental group (5 respondents) using the quota \isi{matching method}.  The characteristics which were used to divide the respondents equally into the two different groups were: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item working languages 
\item interpreting education and/or training 
\item experience in interpreting
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The questionnaire}\label{sec:deysel:3.3}
The questionnaire was divided into different sections, all of which aimed to collect data on:

\begin{itemize}
\item the biographical details of the respondents pertaining to their experience and education in interpreting
\item the perceived knowledge of the respondents as pertaining to their self-assessment activities and their awareness of his/her strengths and weaknesses in \isi{interpreting performance}
\item the respondents’ perceived knowledge about the evaluation process and the applicable criteria considered when evaluating an \isi{interpreting performance} \end{itemize}

A copy of the questionnaire in its entirety is included in Appendix~\ref{03:addendum:B}.
% \todo{LangSci: Create proper link} 
The main section is discussed:

Question 1 of the questionnaire dealt with the working languages of the interpreters and the researchers asked the question to determine the working languages. The majority (80\%) of the respondents indicated that they provide interpreting in \ili{English}.\footnote{Although only 80\% of the respondents indicated they deliver interpreting services in \ili{English}, it forms part of the employment contract of the interpreters in \isi{Parliament} that they must all be able to interpret into \ili{English} as their B language.} The data for the Language A\footnote{Language A is representative of the respondents’ mother tongue or first language.}  distribution was indicated as \ili{Afrikaans} (20\%), \ili{isiZulu} (20\%), \ili{SiSwati} (20\%), \ili{isiNdebele} (10\%), \ili{Sepedi} (10\%), \ili{Sesotho} (10\%) and \ili{Tshivenda} (10\%). 

Questions 2, 4 and 5 of the questionnaire dealt with the interpreters’ practical experience in interpreting. The questions sought to determine how many years’ experience the \isi{interpreter} had, if the \isi{interpreter} had any experience in interpreting before they started interpreting at \isi{Parliament} and lastly in what setting (e.g. \isi{court}, health care, conference), the \isi{interpreter} had experience. The majority (40\%) of the respondents indicated they had between 5--9 years’ experience as an \isi{interpreter}, followed by 30\% indicating they have between 10--20 years’ experience as an \isi{interpreter}. Two respondents (20\%) indicated that they had less than 5 years’ experience while only one \isi{respondent} (10\%) indicated that they had more than 21 years’ experience in interpreting.  

In question 4, the majority (70\%) of the respondents had indicated that they had prior experience in interpreting before they started interpreting at \isi{Parliament}.  

Question 5 was an \isi{open-ended question} inquiring as to the setting where the \isi{respondent} had provided interpreting services. All 7 respondents who had indicated prior experience responded to the question and the text responses were categorized as follow; three interpreters indicated that they had conference interpreting experience. This included interpreting for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Provincial Legislature, conferences, general meetings and workshops. Two interpreters indicated that they had \isi{court} interpreting experience. One \isi{interpreter} indicated they had experience in educational interpreting at university. One \isi{interpreter} indicated that they had their own company which provided interpreting services, while another \isi{interpreter} had indicated that they had been working as a \isi{freelance} \isi{interpreter} for 4 years. In both these instances the specific setting where interpreting services were rendered was not provided. 

Question 3 dealt with the interpreters’ employment at \isi{Parliament}. The researchers wanted to determine how many years the \isi{interpreter} had been interpreting in the environment of the \isi{Parliament}. This data would also indicate how experienced the \isi{interpreter} is in conference interpreting particularly with Parliamentary speeches and \isi{terminology}. The responses indicated that 50\% of the respondents had been working as an \isi{interpreter} in \isi{Parliament} for 5--9 years. 20\% had been working for 10--20 years and 30\% had been working for less than 5 years. 

The majority (80\%) of the respondents indicated that they held a qualification in interpreting, translation or a language practitioner related qualification. Of these, four indicated that they held a tertiary diploma; one indicated a Bachelor’s degree and three indicated that they held an Honours degree, i.e. a qualification after the \textsc{ba} degree that gives access to study on Masters level. The majority (60\%) of the respondents indicated that they received informal training. The informal training was listed as \isi{in-house training} and short courses.  


\subsection{Data collection}
The data collected from the biographical information in the questionnaires was used in the quota matrix \isi{matching method} from experimental studies to divide the respondents equally into the control group (five respondents) and the experimental group (five respondents). A quota sampling method entails gathering representative data from a group. As opposed to random sampling, quota sampling requires that the individuals are chosen out of a specific subgroup. 

The respondents were all coded by using letters of the alphabet (A--J) and the data obtained from the biographical information pertaining to prior experience and education in interpreting were then tabulated according to these codes and the \isi{matching method} was used to divide the respondents on a random basis equally into two groups; namely the experimental group that will be exposed to training, and the control group that won’t receive any training.

The second part of the data collection was the experiment itself. The experiment comprised three major pairs of components: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item independent (\textit{\isi{Black Box}}) and dependent variables (self-assessment skills) 
\item pre-testing and post-testing 
\item experimental (participate in four self-training sessions on \textit{\isi{Black Box}}) and control groups 
\end{enumerate}

The experimental \isi{stimulus}, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, was administered to the experimental group over a course of four sessions. The respondents from the experimental group were required to complete four self-assessment sessions of between 30--60 minutes each (consisting of 10--13 minutes introduction and \isi{interpreting exercise} itself; 12--15 minutes listening to the recording of target and source speech and finally 13--16 minutes completion of the \isi{self-assessment grid}). The self-training sessions consisted of one simultaneous \isi{interpreting exercise} on the software \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, where a parliamentary speech of between 6 and 8 minutes had to be interpreted. The speech was made up of a video as well as audio clip. The target (interpretation of \isi{respondent}) and source (original text) speeches of the self-assessment sessions were recorded on \textit{\isi{Black Box}} which compresses the target and source speech into one single audio file. After completing the \isi{interpreting exercise}, respondents were required to listen to the recording and use a provided grid for self-assessment. The self-assessment grids were collected after each \isi{respondent} had completed it. The aggregate out of 15 for each session was recorded to track progress and compare the marks from each session. 

The ten respondents who participated in the experiment interpreted into their A language, i.e. 7 different languages which formed part of the experimental output. As indicated in \sectref{sec:deysel:3.3}, the data for the Language A distribution was indicated as \ili{Afrikaans} (20\%), \ili{isiZulu} (20\%), \ili{SiSwati} (20\%), \ili{isiNdebele} (10\%), \ili{Sepedi} (10\%), \ili{Sesotho} (10\%) and \ili{Tshivenda} (10\%). An expert for each of these languages was utilized to conduct the expert rating. These experts are rated on their seniority in terms of their language specific background but also their interpreting experience as well as the in-house principles that applied in \isi{Parliament}. They made use of the same assessment grid as utilised by the participants and as attached in the Appendix~\ref{03:addendum:A}.

The video material used in the self-assessment interpreting sessions was re\-corded during National Parliamentary sittings of the National Assembly, readily available on the National \isi{Parliament} of the Republic of South Africa’s YouTube channel. The video material consisted of four speeches from different debates and different political parties, and the length varied from 6 to 8 minutes. The dominant language spoken in the recordings was \ili{English}, but session 2 contained some \ili{Setswana} and \ili{isiNdebele} and session 4 contained some \ili{isiZulu}. \tabref{tab:deysel:3a} below is a representation of the four different sessions.

For the first \isi{self-assessment session} on \textit{\isi{Black Box}} the respondents allocated a mark for pre-testing, i.e. before the intervention. In the final \isi{self-assessment session} the respondents in the experiment allocated a mark that represents their post-testing mark. 

In a traditional experiment the control group is never exposed to the \isi{stimulus}. However, for this research the only way of obtaining a recording which was similar to that of the experimental group was for the control group to be exposed to the \isi{stimulus}. The pre- and post-testing for the control group was done using the same instrument, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, which was the experimental \isi{stimulus} in this study. Thus, unlike a traditional experiment in which the control group is never exposed to the \isi{stimulus}, the control group in this experiment received exposure to the \isi{stimulus} as they had to complete one session of self-assessment of \isi{interpreting performance} on \textit{\isi{Black Box}} in order to get their interpreting assessment score. This was done by allowing the control group to listen to both the target and source texts and to conduct self-assessment. Self-assessment does not necessarily require one to listen to the recording, however in this case it was expected from interpreters to listen to it and reflect on it for self-assessment. The mark obtained in the one session completed on \textit{\isi{Black Box}} by the control group was used as data for pre- and post-testing. Thus, the comparison between the two groups includes the fact that the experimental group received exposure and training on \textit{\isi{Black Box}} over four sessions, whereas the control group only had one session on \textit{\isi{Black Box}}.

At the end of the four sessions, the respondents from the experimental group were interviewed, which aimed to extend the findings of the quantitative data. The main aim of having the interviews was to conduct a follow-up and evaluate the perceptions of the respondents regarding their strengths and weaknesses as well as the criteria they used when evaluating \isi{interpreting performance} post-experiment. The interviews were structured and based on written questions (see Appendix~\ref{03:addendum:C}) and were conducted individually after the respondents from the experimental group completed their final \isi{self-assessment session}.

\section{Results}
Hypothesis testing was used to analyze the quantitative data obtained from the experiment. In hypothesis testing two opposing hypotheses are measured. The two hypotheses are known as the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis is based on the aim of the research, in other words, that the observed differences are the result of real effects, while the null hypothesis would state that there is no significant difference between the populations specified by the study. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is assumed to be true. In this instance, the null hypothesis would be that there is no difference between the means from the absolute errors pre- and post-experiment from the experimental group. The alpha of 0.05 is used as a guideline to determine to what extent the hypothesis may be accepted or rejected. In most analyses, an alpha of 0.05 is used as the cut-off for significance. If the p-value is less than 0.05 ($p < 0.05$), the null hypothesis is rejected. If the p-value is larger than 0.05 ($p > 0.05$)
% \todo{why state the mathematical format? Because in Interpreting Studies we are VERY unfortunately miles away from knowing these things. But I agree, it should be deleted}
 the null hypothesis is accepted to be true. 

Against this background the hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of training software as a self-assessment skills development tool for practicing interpreters is evaluated.

\subsection{Was there a difference in the correlation of self-assessment ratings from the experimental group and the ratings from the expert assessor post-experiment?}

As hypothesis testing was used to analyze the quantitative data obtained from the experiment, the hypothesis test was set up to determine the validity of the statistical claim that there was no difference between the absolute error means pre- and post-experiment. The p-value from the experimental data was calculated at 0.24198 (see \figref{fig:deysel:1}), which meant that based on the p-value, a significant difference could not be concluded. Alternatively, it can be stated as in \tabref{tab:deysel:3}.

Although the results were not statistically significant, the descriptive statistics did indicate that over time the experimental group’s absolute error mean ratings did decrease (see \tabref{tab:deysel:3}). The decreasing absolute error indicates that after exposure to the experiment there were more self-ratings which corresponded with the rating from the experts. The comparison of pre-experimental and post-experimental data (see \tabref{tab:deysel:4}) pertaining to the self-ratings and expert-ratings from the experimental group indicated that, pre-experiment, only one \isi{respondent} could accurately rate themselves in accordance with the rating by the experts. However, there may be shortcomings as this is a small-scale experiment and data was only collected at two instances. Post-experiment data indicated that three respondents could accurately rate themselves in accordance with the rating by the experts.

\subsection{Was there a difference in the self-assessment ratings of the control group when compared to the experimental group post-experiment?}

The means between the final sessions from the experimental group and the control group (see \tabref{tab:deysel:5}) did indicate a difference, with the experimental group scoring higher ratings overall. The experimental group’s average final self-assess\-ment ratings were calculated as a mark of 12.2 out of 15, and the average final \isi{self-assessment} rating from the control group was calculated as a mark of 10.8 out of 15. However, since the control group only had one set of ratings – it could not be used for statistical analysis. The possibility exists that there are other variables which may have contributed to the difference in ratings.

\subsection{Do the self-assessment sessions give the interpreters a better awareness of their strengths and weaknesses in interpreting?}

The analysis of the qualitative data from the questionnaire indicated that it was the perception of the majority of respondents that their strengths in interpreting far outweigh their weaknesses. The qualitative data from Question 11 (\textit{How often do you struggle with the following challenges in interpreting?)} indicated that it was the perception of the majority of the respondents (80\%) that they seldom struggled with challenges in interpreting. 

The qualitative data from Question 12 (\textit{Indicate your ability with regard to the following in simultaneous interpreting}) indicated that there was a positive perception among the majority of respondents when asked a negative Likert-scale question; for example, when the question was posed in the negative, the majority of answers were found among the choices of “\textit{never}” and “\textit{seldom}”. When posed with a positive question, the majority of the answers were “\textit{frequently}” and “\textit{always}”. It was seldom that a \isi{respondent} indicated a challenge or weakness in their \isi{interpreting performance}. 

The marks obtained, both the self-assessment rating as well as the ratings from the experts, in the self-assessment grids from the experimental group respondents were high (see \tabref{tab:deysel:5}). However, the specific questions posed under each \isi{macro error} section of the self-assessment grids showed that the respondents did encounter challenges in their \isi{interpreting performance}, especially when it pertained to the interpretation of \isi{idiomatic} expressions and accurate interpretation of numbers and dates.\largerpage  

In the qualitative data from the interviews, it was the perception of all respondents that the self-training sessions gave them a better awareness of their strengths and weaknesses. In answer to Q3 (\textit{Were you satisfied with your \isi{interpreting performance}?)}, four of the respondents were satisfied with their \isi{interpreting performance} and one \isi{respondent} indicated that they were “not quite” satisfied. In answer to Q4 (\textit{Was your \isi{interpreting performance} better or worse than you expected?),} all the respondents indicated that their performance was better than they had expected. In answer to Q5 (\textit{In the questionnaire there was a section pertaining to your abilities in interpreting. After having conducted self-assessment – do you think that your initial judgments were correct?),} two of the respondents indicated that their initial judgments of their abilities in interpreting had been correct. One \isi{respondent} indicated that their ability was better than they had expected. Other respondents indicated that their judgments were correct but that they “\textit{can do better of course}”. One \isi{respondent} indicated that \textit{“some things were better than I thought they would be”.} In answer to Q14 (\textit{Do you feel that the self-study sessions has given you a better awareness of your strengths and weaknesses in interpreting?)}, all respondents indicated that the \isi{self-assessment session} gave them a better awareness of their strengths and weaknesses. 

\subsection{Do the self-assessment sessions give the interpreters a better awareness of the criteria used in the evaluation of interpreting performance?}
\largerpage
The data collected from the questionnaires indicated that the perception of the respondents regarding the criteria used in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance} was quite vague and incomplete. Question 13 of the questionnaire is an \isi{open-ended question} inquiring from the respondents to list the criteria they find important in the evaluation of an \isi{interpreting performance}. The data collected from this question was arranged in tabular format according to the macro errors; 1) accuracy, 2) \isi{target language} and 3) delivery (see \figref{fig:deysel:2}; also see Appendix~\ref{03:addendum:A} again). Under each of the macro errors examples of errors were listed. A heading for ‘other’ was been added. From the data provided, it was deduced that the respondents were not completely aware of the criteria used when evaluating an \isi{interpreting performance}. Only half of the respondents (50\%) indicated that accuracy is important in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance}, while only 20\% of respondents indicated that \isi{target language} is important in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance}. The majority of examples listed by the respondents were found under the \isi{macro error} of delivery. However, each \isi{respondent} listed only one item under this \isi{macro error}.

\end{figure}

The data collected and analyzed for the \isi{macro error} of accuracy indicate that it is the perception of half of the respondents (50\%) that accuracy is important in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance}. The terms “accuracy”, “content accuracy” and “message accuracy” were used. None of the respondents list “omissions” or “additions” as criteria. There were also no examples given of what constitutes “accuracy”.  

The data analyzed for \isi{target language} indicate that it is the perception of 20\% of respondents that \isi{target language} is important in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance}. Only two respondents (20\%) listed criteria pertaining to the category of \isi{target language} by indicating that ‘\isi{terminology} accuracy’ and ‘vocabulary’ are important criteria in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance}. One \isi{respondent} (10\%) indicated that ‘sentence construction’ is important when evaluating \isi{interpreting performance}. 

In the analysis of the data under the \isi{macro error} of delivery, seven respondents (70\%) listed criteria which pertain to delivery. Eleven different micro errors were listed as criteria important in the evaluation of \isi{interpreting performance}. The analysis of data gathered from this question reveals a strong focus on the \isi{macro error} of delivery when seen in relation to the variety of micro errors listed. Two respondents (20\%) listed the \isi{micro error} pertaining to tone of voice by stating: ‘tone of voice follows the speaker’ and ‘voice tone’. Two respondents (20\%) listed criteria pertaining to the \isi{micro error} of \isi{audibility} by listing: ‘\isi{audibility}’. 

Eleven other micro errors pertaining to the category of delivery were listed; Absence of fillers – 10\%; Avoiding long pauses – 10\%; Breathing – 10\%; Consistency – 10\%; Coherence – 10\%; Correct \isi{intonation} – 10\%; Delivery smooth and clear – 10\%; Pleasant to hear presentation – 10\%; Time lag 10\%. Only one \isi{respondent} (10\%) listed criteria across all three different macro errors (accuracy, \isi{target language}, delivery).

In the qualitative data from the interviews, it was the perception of all respondents that the exposure to the self-assessment sessions had improved their understanding of the criteria used in the evaluation of an \isi{interpreting performance}. In answer to Q6 (\textit{Before the self-study sessions – were you aware of criteria used in the evaluation of interpreting?)}, two of the respondents indicated that, before the self-assessment sessions, they were not aware of the criteria used in the evaluation of interpreting. Three respondents indicated that they were aware of the criteria used in the evaluation of interpreting. In answer to Q7 (\textit{Do you feel that your understanding of the criteria has improved with the self-study sessions?)} when asked if the respondents’ understanding of the criteria had improved with the exposure to the self-assessment sessions, there was a consensus among all five respondents that their understanding had improved. One \isi{respondent} indicated that their understanding of the criteria improved, especially after completing the electronic questionnaire. The questions posed in the questionnaire might have triggered the respondents’ thoughts and lead them to reflect on the criteria used when evaluating \isi{interpreting performance}. The self-assessment grids which were used in the \isi{self-assessment session} also clearly indicated the various macro errors and criteria used for the evaluation of an \isi{interpreting session}. 

\section{Conclusion}

It is important to emphasize that the study did not seek to evaluate the performance of the interpreters but it was rather aimed at evaluating self-assessment skills of the interpreters. The marks from both the self-assessment and expert ratings were relatively high --  indicating that the interpreters perform at a high level. This ought to be expected since the interpreters are no longer student interpreters, but full-time professional interpreters. The means (both the self-ratings and the ratings by the experts) between the final sessions from the experimental group and the control group did indicate a difference in the averages from the groups (see \tabref{tab:deysel:5}), with the experimental group scoring higher ratings. This indicates that their self-assessment did differ from that of the control group. However, there are several variables which may have contributed to this difference in ratings.  

The empirical study sought to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. The primary research aim of the study set out to evaluate whether the \textsc{cait} tool, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, was effective in the development of self-assessment skills in professional interpreters. The primary research aim was sub-divided into four research questions and that was addressed above under the results. According to the results of this small scale research study, it can be concluded that the \textsc{cait} tool, \textit{\isi{Black Box}}, may prove effective in the development of self-assessment skills in professional interpreters.
