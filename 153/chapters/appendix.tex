Below are all items from the Reddy et al. dataset for which raters
 used 2 different word senses, followed by the relation
and word sense coding for \citet{BellandSchaefer:2016} and comments
indicating which reading is covered by the coding (recall that the
2016 annotations are not word-sense specific).
