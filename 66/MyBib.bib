  annote = {Haspelmath, Martin. 1990. "The grammaticization of passive morphology".
	Studies in Language 14.1:25-71.p. 25To this almost excessive attention
	from the point of view of syntax corresponds a relative negligence
	of the morphological aspects of passive constructions, most importantly
	the passive marker on the verb (other morphological devices used
	in passive constructions, such as instrumental or locative markers
	of agent phrases, are normally not specific to passive constructions
	and are not considered ?passive morphology? here).Indeed, the passive
	can be regarded as first and foremost a verbal morphological category
	whose meaning implies certain changes in the clause structure.p.
	26-27Bur first we must ask whether passives are possible without
	any particular morphological marking. If the passive were basically
	a syntactic phenomenon, a relation-changing rule analogous to object
	raising or possessor raising, or a pragmatically-motivated rule like
	topic fronting or interrogative phrase fronting (?wh-movement?),
	it would not be unexpected to find passive constructions without
	special morphology on the verb.Dryer 1982, defending the view that
	the universal and essential part of the passive is its syntactic
	property, observes that passive morphology can be of different types
	(not only auxiliary + participle, but also suffix on the verb, etc.)
	or even be completely lacking. He concludes that passive morphology
	is just an accidental fact about individual languages.{\^a}{\euro}ž``Given
	the following definition of passive constructions:A construction
	is called passive if:(i) the active subject corresponds either to
	a non-obligatory oblique phrase or to nothing; and(ii) the active
	direct object (if any) corresponds to the subject of the passive;
	and(iii) the construction is somehow restricted vis-{\`a}-vis another
	unrestricted construction (the active), e.g. less frequent, functionally
	specialized, not fully productive.I claim that in general passive
	constructions without passive morphology do not exist.``...The Kinyarwanda
	construction mentioned by Keenan 1985: 255 does not qualify as a
	passive because the postverbal agent cannot be omitted and the preposed
	patient exhibits almost no subject properties. Kimenyi1980:141ff
	(Keenan?s source) is careful not to call this construction ?passive,?
	but ?object-subject reversal.?p. 32In many lgs, the gr. Morphemes
	that mark the passive are not restricted to this function but can
	have other uses, such as reflexive, reciprocal, ancticausative and
	potential passive. ? The question now is whether any pattern can
	be discerned in the distribution of this uses.p. 595.4 The basic
	functions of the passiveIt has been long recognized that the two
	main functions of the passive are the foregrounding (or topicalization)
	of the patient and the backgrounding of the agent (e.g. Gabelentz
	1861:{\S}2, with references to earlier work). And just as old is
	probably the question of which of these two functions is the dominating
	one. Among recent functionalist studies, Givon 1979 emphasizes the
	topicalization function, whereas Shibatani 1985 takes ?agent defocusing?
	as the main function of the passive. In the relational syntactic
	debates of the 70s, Perlmutter and Postal 1977analyzed passives as
	advancement of the initial direct object to subject, whereas Comrie
	1977 favored an analysis where the initial subject is demoted spontaneously.
	And going back to the earlier part of this century, Brugmann took
	topicalization as the main function of the passive, whereas Meillet
	considered the agent backgrounding function more important.},

	color naming have confounded two questions: (1) Is color naming largely
	subject to local linguistic convention? and (2) Are cross-language
	color naming differences reflected in comparable differences in color
	cognition by their speakers? The 'relativist' position holds that
	the correct answer to both questions is Yes, based on data from the
	Berinmo language of Papua New Guinea. It is shown here that the Berinmo
	facts instead support a more complex view -- that cross-language
	color naming follows non-trivial universal tendencies, while cross-language
	color-naming differences do indeed correlate with differences in
	color cognition. The rhetoric of 'relativity' versus 'universalism'
	impedes understanding of cross-language color naming and cognition.},

  abstract = {1.1. Voice and voice systems: basicness and some basic concepts p.
	26[{\ldots}]For several years, many linguists have been interested
	in the typology of case and case systems including, for example,
	the comparative properties of ergative-absolutive and nominative-accusative
	systems. These two types of system differ from one another according
	to the patterns by which case is assigned to the core (essential)
	arguments of transitive and intransitive sentences (these arguments
	being subject and object for transitive, subject alone for intransitives).
	Both types of system commonly embody devices for reorganizing the
	assignment of core grammatical relations to particular thematic roles
	(or to the arguments bearing these roles) . For instance, the name
	`passive' is applied to a device of this variety commonly found in
	accusative languages; `antipassive' is considered the counterpart
	to passive in ergative case systems. Such devices relate classes
	of sentences and are often viewed as derivational processes. The
	basis for their existence varies from language to language; in some
	systems (`role-dominated' languages in the parlance of Foley and
	Van Valin, 1984) their motivation is syntactic/semantic; in others
	(Foley and Van Valin's `reference-dominated' systems) their motivation
	is attributed to discourse and pragmatic factors. In many languages,
	of course, syntactic and discourse factors both playa role in processes
	of this sort. Whatever their motivation, these devices are usually
	regarded as rearranging the basic syntactic organization of a sentence,
	i.e., as interchanging the grammatical relations of arguments representing
	certain roles. In accusative languages, as mentioned above, certain
	processes which have this effect are said to represent `passivization'.
	What happens under passivization is usually viewed in one of two
	ways.In the simplest scheme, Agent is the role normally borne by
	grammatical subjects in nonderived sentences (Keenan, 1976b); sentences
	which have agentive subjects are said to be in the active voice';
	and ``sentences in nonactive voices ... are to be derived by promoting
	to subject (position) various non-subject constituents of active
	sentences {\ldots} .'' (Keenan, 1976a:255). Grammatical voice, according
	to this view, is a system for moving arguments `representing nonagential
	thematic relations into subject position. A limitation of this analysis
	is, of course, that few (if any) languages restrict subjects of nonderived
	sentences to the Agent role.Rather than treating Agent as a role
	basic to subject, a more sophisticated approach to sentence derivation
	might be taken by viewing Agent as the prototypical subject thematic
	role. Suppose one has a scheme under which verbs (or verbal concepts)
	are grouped into several well defined semantic classes. (For examples
	of such schemata see Dik, 1980:53; and see Foley and Van Valin, 1984:40ff.,
	who use a classification scheme attributed to Dowty and Vendler.)
	If one adopts some such scheme, a different thematic role can be
	ascribed to basic subjects for each verb class. Agent then furnishes
	the prototype of `basic subject'; i.e., as Agent is the role basic
	to subject in verb class A, so another thematic role is basic to
	subject in *class B, and so on. (One can simplify the scheme by taking
	all the roles basic to the subjects of the different verb classes
	and assigning them to a single macrocategory, such as Foley and Van
	Valin's `actor' macroroles.) Then the passive can be seen essentially
	as a process for moving thematic arguments in and out of sentential
	subject position. In other words, passive relates two classes of
	sentences: one class in which the thematic role borne by the subject
	corresponds to the Agent prototype; and another class of sentences
	in which the thematic role borne by the subject does not. Once processes
	like passive (and their counterparts in nonaccusative systems) are
	defined in this way, one can proceed to working out their expressive,
	pragmatic and syntactic functions. Much recent research in theoretical
	grammar has been taken up with these issues. The present essay, however,
	is principally concerned with the typology of subject's relation
	to sententially expressed situations in basic, not derived, sentences.
	In various languages, subjects of nonderived sentences seem to be
	permitted to have either of two conceptual statuses. I shall refer
	to these statuses in the present essay as `controller' and `affected
	entity', Again, in various languages, a formal alternation in verbal
	morphology indicate which of the two statuses is borne by the sentential
	subject. In this essay, I all refer to such alternate forms as diathesis,
	and the system to which they pertain I shall refer to as voice.The
	notions Controller and affected entity might be clarified by a comparison
	with the concepts actor and undergoer introduced by Foley and Van
	Valin, 1984. It has been observed that Foley and Van Valin define
	actor as a macrorole, i.e., as a concept superordinate to relations
	like Agent, Instrument, Goal and so forth. Thus the italicized items
	in (1a-e) below are classified as actors (p. 30), although each represents
	a distinct thematic relation. Analogously, Foley and Van Valin suggest
	that there is a macrorole which furnishes the prototype of basic
	object, namely the undergoer macrorole; thus they (ibid.) classify
	each italicized role in (2a-e) below as an undergoer. [{\ldots}]In
	the present essay I shall use the undergoer macrorole notion of Foley
	and Van Valin, but a concept `affected entity' is to be introduced
	as well. It is distinct from undergoer, since affected entity is
	not a thematic relation; rather, it is a conceptual status (like
	`controller', which will be considered shortly). Affected entity
	status can accrue to arguments representing various thematic relations,
	and in fact it can converge with either macrorole posited by Foley
	and Van Valin, actor or undergoer, upon a single sentential argument.
	This will be clarified in the body of the essay.In the essay I also
	refer to `controller', a conceptual status distinct from the macrothematic
	concept actor. The latter will be more often referred to below by
	the term `source', indicating the argument to whose participation
	onces can attribute the eventuality represented in a sentence --
	i.e., that argument in whose absence killing would not have taken
	place in (1a), shattering in (1b), receiving in (1e), sensing in
	(1d), emitting in (1e), throwing in (2a) and so on. I agree with
	Foley and Van Valin's positing some such macrorole, but dissent from
	their attributing the conceptual status `controller' to the actor
	(source) macrorole exclusively. That is, the principal difference
	between my scheme and Foley and van Valin's lies in the absolute
	distinction they draw between actors and undergoers; the two macroroles
	cannot converge upon a single argument in the same sentence. For
	instance, Foley and Van Valin identify the underlined argument in
	(1d) above as an actor; it cannot also represent an undergoer. However,
	according to the scheme of this essay, the argument in question is
	both an actor (or source) and an affected entity.By affected entity
	is meant the participant perceived as affected or most affected in
	consequence of the sententially denoted action (= situation). An
	affected entity may undergo action but need not do so; in some languages,
	as we will see, an entity can be perceived as affected in virtue
	of performing, not undergoing, certain actions. Conversely, while
	controller conceptual status is ordinarily associated with actors,
	it may accrue to undergoers in some systems (see Section 4 below).
	By way of a working definition, controller status can be ascribed
	to the argument whose participation is seen as determining the course
	and/or outcome of a sententially denoted action. A later part of
	this essay, Section 5, is devoted to discussing further the definition
	and universal /particular manifestations of the conceptual status
	of controller. Overall, the essay will show that not only do conceptual
	statuses (controller, affected entity) and particular thematic/macrothematic
	relations sometimes converge, but that conditions and constraints
	on their convergence define a typology of voice systems.p. 291.2.
	Scope of the study As stated above, this essay is not principally
	coned with processes like passive and antipassive. The effects of
	these processes are often signalled in verbal morphology by derivational
	markers, and are sometimes accounted for in terms of sentence-deriving
	rules. This is why these processes are referred to in the present
	essay by the term `derived voice'. However, no prejudice is intended
	to analyses in which passives, antipassives, etc., are base-generated,
	or otherwise not accounted for by some formal process operating on
	`basic' syntactic/semantic structures (see fn. 2). `Derived voice'
	is simply intended here to mean processes, like passive and antipassive,
	that can be analyzed in terms of sentence derivation (whether the
	individual analyst chooses to do so or not is beside the point) .
	In applying the term `voice' to such processes, it is easy for the
	analyst to overlook the fact that the same term usually refers to
	a very different class of phenomena in traditional grammar. In fact,
	the use of the term `voice' in reference to sentence-deriving processes
	(i.e., regular formal relationships among classes of sentences) is
	a fairly recent innovation. A traditional grammarian, Jespersen,
	1965:164ff., has presented a detailed discussion of the relation
	of active and passive constructions in {English} while explicitly
	maintaining that this relation is not one of `voice'. Rather, he
	treats active and passive as formally related sentence types, in
	contrast to voice oppositions as found in classical languages, e.g.,
	active and middle in Greek and Sanskrit ([{\ldots}]). In the present
	essay, to distinguish active/middle and similar systems from `derived
	voice', the term `basic voice' is introduced. This term denotes a
	type of relation encoded in verbal morphology (i.e., through diathesis),
	signalling which of several alternative conceptual statuses is borne
	by the sentential subject. Basic voice oppositions are not analyzable
	in derivational terms (i.e., in terms of a rule for relating one
	class of sentences to another). [{\ldots}][{\ldots}]p. 30It seems
	to me that the goal of a better understanding of the relations between
	basic voice systems and derived voice processes is a worthy starting
	point for a general program of research. The present essay is intended
	to contribute to the research program in two principal ways: (i)
	by offering an account of several different voice systems within
	a single descriptive framework; (ii) by proposing a rudimentary scheme
	of typological classification for basic voice systems (Section 6).
	In addition, Section 5 offers some speculations on how voice systems
	may relate to a variety of other mechanisms for encoding a particular
	semantic function, the expression of control (a parameter whose significance
	will be increasingly apparent in Sections 2-4 below). [{\ldots}]As
	hinted in Section 1.1. above, a major claim of this essay is that
	the conceptual status of sentential arguments plays a role in the
	organization of (basic) voice systems. A good starting point for
	justifying this claim might be in noting that the concept of voice
	is often explained in exactly this way in traditional grammars, particularly
	in descriptions of classical Indo-European languages. Many of these
	descriptions more or less explicitly treat diathesis (verbal voice
	marking) as a means of encoding a distinction in views of sententially
	denoted action, a distinction having to do with the subject referent's
	conceptual status -- its perceived relationship to the action's effects.
	Lyons, 1968:363, summarizing the respective functions of active and
	middle (mediopassive) voice in Latin, Greek, and other classical
	Indo-European languages, alludes to this distinction. He remarks
	that, whereas the active verb expresses a view of the subject as
	an Agent or doer of the sententially denoted action, the use of middle
	voice is to mark situations in which ``the `action' or `state' affects
	the subject of the verb or his interests.'' (emphasis added) The
	following section presents some illustrations of middle voice functions
	in two classical languages. This will be a useful preliminary to
	our later survey of other languages, some of which have not been
	traditionally thought of as voice-embodying languages. p. 312. VOICE
	FUNCTIONS IN CLASSICAL INDO-EUROPEAN 2.1. Classical Greek In classical
	Greek most conjugations of the verb require the marking of the active/middle
	distinction. A typical function of the middle in Greek is to indicate
	an identity relation between the subject (or more properly, the source
	argument) and the direct object (or more properly, the undergoer).
	That is, a middle voice verb may convey reflexive or reciprocal activity.
	Examples, (3a-c) below (from Barber, 1975) illustrate this function.
	Another middle voice function, referred to by Barber as the ``plain
	middle'', is that of showing the subject's beneficiary status vis-{\`a}-vis
	the action; i.e., for conveying the subject's dual status, as source
	(performer) of the action and as affected entity, or locus of the
	action's effects. Illustrations (again, from Barber) are provided
	in (4-5).[{\ldots}]p. 32Several additional functions of Greek middle
	voice are outlined by Smyth (1974). One of these (for which an appropriate
	designation might be `nucleonic middle') involves the expression
	of action in which the undergoer can be seen as, in some way, within
	the ``sphere'' (Smyth's terminology) of the Subject. Thus the middle
	is used when the undergoer, is the property of -- or belongs to --
	the Subject (`wash one's hands', `give one's vote'); when the undergoer
	moves into the sphere of the Subject (`to send for a thing'); or
	when' the undergoer moves out of the sphere of --the Subject (`sell',
	i.e., `give a thing for one's `profit'; `deliver a speech'). Another
	typical use of Greek middle voice is for expressing the disposition
	of the Subject. In other words, there is a preference for middle
	diathesis when effects logically accrue to no party but the Subject.
	This function is especially typical of deponent. Middle verbs (Smyth,
	p.. 393). Some of these verbs denote bodily or physical disposition,
	i.e., `jump', `fly', `dance', etc.; others denote emotive or mental
	disposition, i.e., `perceive', `wish', `consider', `lament', etc.
	Apart from the deponent (disposition-expressing) function, middle
	voice generally seems to be selected over active in Greek where the
	action's effects, good or ii, accrue to the Subject; thus middle
	is the typical diathesis of verbs such as `marry', `make peace',
	etc.According to Smyth (ibid., p. 390) the middle voice in Greek
	indicates broadly that the action is performed with `special reference'
	to the subject. The various middle voice functions outlined above
	suggest that this special reference involves an identity between
	the source of action and the entity principally affected thereby.
	There is, though, one further function of middle diathesis in Greek
	and in lE generally (the `passive' middle function). Discussion of
	which will be deferred to the end of the following outline of voice
	in classical Sanskrit. p. 332.2. Classical Sanskrit Traditional Sanskrit
	grammars use the terms {\=a}tmane-pada and parasmaipada, respectively,
	to refer to middle and active diathesis. The terms {\=a}tmane and
	parasmai literally mean `for oneself' and `for another', while pada
	means `term' or `word'. Evidently, then, the early Sanskrit grammarians
	conceived of diathesis as the marking of a conceptual distinction
	between actions whose effects bear principally on their sources,
	and actions whose effects bear principally on arguments other than
	their sources. Commentary on the functions of the two diatheses in
	the early Sanskrit grammar attributed to P{\=a}{\d n}ini tends to
	confirm this. It also reveals the close similarity of verbal voice
	functions in Sanskrit to those of classical Greek. [{\ldots}]p. 716.
	THE TYPOLOGY OF VOICE: CONCLUSIONS Processes of subject derivation,
	or derived voice, have been distinguished in this essay from voice
	alternations in nonderived sentences, or basic voice. Basic voice
	has been seen as a system for marking identity or non-identity of
	the sentential subject with the conceptual status of affected entity.
	The distinction is encoded on sentential verbs through nonderivational
	morphological alternations in verbal bases; i.e., diathesis. p. 72Affected
	entity is neither a grammatical nor a thematic relation; it is a
	conceptual status which may be assigned to arguments representing
	certain thematic roles. Specifically, affected entity status may
	devolve upon either of the essential or core arguments of transitive
	sentence structures, source (actor) or undergoer. Affected entity
	is closely related to another conceptual status, that of control,
	i.e., locus of control over sententially denoted action. The determination
	of controller is highly viable cross-linguistically, although it
	frequently plays a role in basic subject selection (sometimes in
	combination with the actor macrorole). But however controller is
	defined , and however it functions in any particular system, it is
	hypothesized that affected entity will be defined in that system
	in terms of the notion control. That is, affected entity in any system
	represents the locus of maximum effective or potential control over
	verbally denoted action. This testable hypothesis is the major result
	of the present investigation and is intended as a foundation hypothesis
	for future research on voice systems and their typology. From this
	hypothesis it follows that affected entities in any basic voice system
	will have just the semantic properties associated with controllers.
	Therefore, affected entity, will converge or not with the macrorole
	notion actor (source) just to the degree that controller status tends
	to converge with Source in the particular system. Among the languages
	surveyed in this essay, for instance, Tamil shows a strong tendency
	for basic subject to represent the convergence of source thematic
	role and controller status; likewise, affected entity status accrues
	only to source-subjects in Tamil basic sentences. At the other extreme,
	Korean and Navajo show little if any tendency for source and controller
	to converge on any one grammatical relation in sentence structures.
	Rather, controller status combines with either of the core thematic
	relations in transitive structures to create the either of the core
	thematic relations in transitive structures to create the sentential
	subject; and affected entity status, too, can devolve upon either
	of those two thematic relations in subject position.It seems, then,
	that an illuminating typological schema for voice systems can be
	constructed upon a scale, of core thematic relation-affected entity
	identities. This is shown in (52) below, which places the major languages
	surveyed in this paper in an ordered ranking according to a scale
	of affected entity-macrorole identities:p. 73Among the languages
	surveyed in the essay it is close to9 the X-extreme that one would
	place Tamil, as a language in which affected entity invariably has
	the thematic role of source (actor). Proceeding toward the Y-end
	of the scale we next have classical lE systems. In these languages
	there is a convergence of affected entity and source thematic role
	much of the time, but not always; e.g., not in the catalytic and
	passive functions of the affective (i.e., middle) voice. Closer to
	the Y-end of the scale we find the next system, Korean. Only in relatively
	rare instances (such as ex. 43 above) can undergoer and affected
	entity be seen as not strictly coinciding in this language. At the
	far Y-extreme of the scale, lastly, we have systems like Navajo,
	in which, evidently, all affected subjects are also undergoers. It
	deserves mention in closing that a hierarchical scale defined by
	actor and undergoer at its two extremes, the Actor/Undergoer hierarchy,
	is proposed by Foley and Van Valin, 1984:59. They do so in order
	to explain cross-language tendencies for certain pragmatic and thematic
	relations to converge in sentential functional structure. It may
	be a tribute to the accuracy and elegance of the scale they set up
	that it seems to find confirmation in the typology of voice systems.

  abstract = {Many languages have no basic color term for "blue." Instead, they
	call short-wavelength stimuli "green" or "dark". We show that this
	cultural, linguistic phenomenon could result from accelerated aging
	of the eye because of high, chronic exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B)
	in sunlight (e.g., phototoxic lens brunescence). Reviewing 203 world
	languages, we found a significant relationship between UV dosage
	and color naming: In low-UV localities, languages generally have
	the word "blue"; in high-UV areas, languages without "blue" prevail.
	Furthermore, speakers of these non-"blue" languages often show blue-yellow
	color vision deficiency. We tested our phototoxicity hypothesis in
	a color-naming experiment, using computerized, colorimetric simulations
	of Munsell colors as viewed through clear and brunescent lenses.
	As predicted, our young subjects used "blue" as in {English} when
	the simulated lens was clear, but named colors as in tropical languages
	when the lens was dense. Our within-subjects design precludes a cultural
	explanation for this result.},

  journal = {Journal of Pragmatics},
  year = {2005},

  pages = {461-495},
  abstract = {An influential claim in the child language literature posits that
	children use structural cues in the input language to acquire verb
	meaning (Gleitman, 1990). One such cue is the of arguments co-occurring
	with the verb, which provides an indication as to the event type
	associated with the verb (Fisher, 1995). In some languages however
	(e.g. {Hindi}), verb arguments are ellipted relatively freely, subject
	to certain discourse-pragmatic constraints. In this paper, we address
	three questions: Is the pervasive argument ellipsis characteristic
	of adult {Hindi} also found in {Hindi}-speaking caregivers' ? If
	so, do children consequently make errors in verb transitivity? How
	early do children learning a split-ergative language, such as {Hindi},	exhibit sensitivity to discourse-pragmatic influences on argument
	realization? We show that there is massive argument ellipsis in caregivers'
	input to 3-4 year-olds. However, children acquiring {Hindi} do not
	make transitivity errors in their own speech. Nor do they elide arguments
	randomly. Rather, even at this early age, children appear to be sensitive
	to discourse-pragmatics in their own spontaneous speech production.
	These findings in a split-ergative language parallel patterns of
	argument realization found in children acquiring both nominative-accusative
	languages (e.g. Korean) and ergative-absolutive languages (e.g. {Tzeltal}, 	Inuktitut).},

  annote = {Partially contradictory e.g. 4.3. on Pivot) and not very clear at
	some places, but contains a great deal of good examples.p. 117If
	the passive is a typologically valid category, it must, like all
	such categories, be identified in terms of the meaning or function
	it shares across languages, and in terms of its formal marking in
	individual lgs. (Palmer 1986: 2-7).It can be said that the basic
	functions of the passive are the promotion of the Patient (or non-Agent)
	and the demotion or deletion of the Agent (but see 6.7). This does
	not involve the acceptance of a particular syntactic theory, but
	merely implies that the functions of the roles of Agent, Patient
	etc. in the passive can be accounted for in terms of variation from
	their functions in the active sentence.It is the recognition that
	the Agent is the Subject and the Patient is the Object in the active
	sentence and that the active is the basic construction (see 3.1),
	white the Patient (or non-Agent) is the Subject and the Agent has
	peripheral status or is absent in the passive sentence, that makes
	it possible to talk about the promotion of the Patient to Subject
	and the demotion or deletion of the Agent. As already argued, the
	passive must have some formal marking, and it seems generally true.
	That there is marking on the verb. Haspelmath (1990: 267) argues
	that the are no passive constructions without passive verbal morphology,
	but, provided `verbal morphology' is used widely to include clitics,
	this may be no more than a part of the definition of passive rather
	than an empirical observation.p. 1195.2 Promotion of Object There
	are some verbs in {English} that do not appear to have passives,
	e.g. HAVE (in the sense of possession) and RESEMBLE. This is also
	true of CONTAIN in a stative sense, but not in a dynamic sense. Equal1y,
	verbs such as WEIGH May passivize when their `objects' refer to the
	items weighed, but not to the measurement: One way of dealing with
	this problem is to say that the NP after the verb is not an Object.
	Apart from the lack of passivization, the arguments are Dot notional1y
	patients, but locatives or terms of measurement (often called `adjuncts').However,
	that is not an entirely valid argument, since, as will be seen in
	5.3, promotion by passivization is not a test of `Object-hood'. It
	might be more appropriate to recognize another type of (grammatical)
	argument, which occupies the place of the Object with an active verb,
	yet is (a) not affected by passivization, and (b) does not have the
	notional role of patient. However, if availability for promotion
	is taken to establish such NPs as o objects, there is considerable
	variation in languages in respect of the notional roles of the NPs
	that may function as Objects. Thus, in Arabic both temporal and locative
	NPs are marked morphologically as Objects and can be promoted to
	Subject by passivization (Davison 1980: 51-2):p. 121ln Kinyarwanda
	(Bantu) all kinds of notional roles may be similarly identified as
	Objects. Unlike their translational equivalents in {English}, the
	verbs `have', `weigh' etc. an have passives; `have' is exemplified
	in (Kimenyi 1980: 127f): Similar, but more surprising, perhaps are
	the passives in (Kimenyi 1988: 361f):Umug{\'o}re a-rwaa-ye um{\'u}twe
	Woman she-be.sick-ASP headache `The woman has a headache' Um{\'u}twe
	u-rwaa-w-e n'{\^u}mug{\'o}re headache it-be.sick-PASS-ASP by woman
	`It is the woman that bas a headache' Umug{\'o}re y-{\'a}-b{\'a}a-ye
	perezida woman she-PST-be-ASP president `The woman became president'
	Perezida y-a-baa-w-e n'{\^u}mug{\'o}represident he-PST-be-PASS-ASP
	by woman `It is the woman who became president' Umugabo a-ra-geend-a
	ijoro man he-PRS-travel-ASP night `The man is travelling in the night'Ijoro
	ri-ra-geend-w-a n'{\^u}mugabo night it-PRS-travel-PASS-ASP by man
	`Is the man who is travelling in the night'(Kimenyi does not explain
	why he uses the translations beginning with `It is the woman/man
	who{\ldots}'; the obvious implication is that the Agent is focused
	by passivization.) He notes that `all semantic roles, patients, datives,
	benefactives, manners, instrumentals, goals, locatives, temporals,
	attributives . . . , function as direct objects'. Often a verb has
	what seem to be two Objects (including the types just discussed)
	and either may be promoted:Umugaanga a-ru-vuur-a umug{\'o}re ink{\^o}r{\'o}ra
	doctor he-PRS-cure-ASP woman cough `The doctor is treating the woman's
	cough' Umug{\'o}re a-ra-vuur-w-a {\'\i}nk{\^o}r{\'o}ra n'{\^u}mugaanga
	woman she-PRS-cure-PASS-ASP cough by doctor `*The woman is being
	treated the cough by the doctor' ink{\^o}r{\'o}ra i-ra-yuur-w-a umug{\'o}re
	n'{\^u}mugaanga cough it-PRS-cure-PASS-ASP woman by doctor `*The
	cough is being treated woman by the doctor' Treating these in terms
	of constructions with two Objects entails the recognition of the
	construction Subject + Object + Object as well as the usual tr. Subject+
	Object. It might be claimed that these are not Objects but various
	kinds of oblique relations. There are two arguments against this:
	they are not formally distinguished from Objects `proper' in any
	way, {\ldots} Kinyarwanda has oblique relations (Dative, Instrumental
	and Locative) that are formally marked as such and can be also promoted
	to Subject (but see 6.6.2).There is equally no evidence to suggest
	that, when there are two Objects, they can be distinguished as primary
	and secondary Objects (2.4, but see 6.6.2). Another language that
	has a construction with two Objects, either of which may be promoted,
	is Tigrinya (Ethiopian Semitic, personal research), but this occurs
	only with the verb `give': There is another construction with two
	Objects in Tigrinya, but only one of them may be promoted. This is
	the construction in which the second Object indicates a part of the
	body and the first is marked as animate. Only the Object marked as
	animate may be promoted: (There is a similar construction in Korean
	-- see 5.6.) Rather different are the passives in {English} exemplified
	by (see Palmer 1987: 215ff.):The daughter looked after the old man
	The old man was looked after by the daughterIn the active the old
	man seems to be part of a prepositional phrase, but, obviously, look
	after is treated as a single verb with the old man as its object.
	Similar passives are possible with idioms such as do away with, get
	rid off, put up with. But passivization is possible with some combinations
	of verb plus preposition, even though there is no such idiomaticity:
	This hat has been sat on.The bed has been slept in.Finally, it should
	be noted that even if a lg bas a passive, not all Objects/Patients
	can be promoted to Subject. Thus it was seen in 2.2 that in Korean
	the passive Subject must be `in general, animate and conscious'.
	Objects that do{\^A}{\textperiodcentered} not have these characteristics
	cannot be promoted. p. 1255.3 Promotion of oblique terms Although
	the Patient-Object is the tern most commonly promoted to Subject,
	in some lgs terms other than Objects, oblique terms, may also be
	promoted. The Beneficiary-Dative is often promoted (and it is relevant
	to note that the Beneficiary was often the promoted term in the double
	Object constructions of 5.2), An example from Japanese is (Song 1987:
	75):{\ldots}Whether this is also true of {English} (as the translation
	given above might suggest) is discussed in 6.6. More strikingly,
	Malagasy has a passive voice, but also a `circumstantial' voice,
	which promotes both the Beneficiary-Dative and the Instrumental.
	Examples (Keenan 1972: 172- 3): The verb form indicates whether the
	Subject is the Agent, the Patient or one of the oblique terms, and
	the Subject appears in final position. The promoted Subjects (`the
	rice', `the children', `the money') also have the syntactic characteristics
	of Subjects in that they may function as pivots. They are used as
	heads of relative clauses, and it may be recalled that in Malagasy
	it is only Subjects that can be relativised:{\ldots} A very different
	language that cao also promote either the Object or the Instrumental
	is Kwakwala (Wakashan, British Columbia, Levine 1980: 241, Anderson
	1985: 166). Examples are (the glosses are from Anderson, and notice
	that the suffixes on the NPs indicate the relation of the following
	NP):n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-i-da g{\'E}{\texttrademark}nan{\'E}{\texttrademark}m-x{\`I}{\textsterling}a
	guk{\^E}{\textperiodcentered}-sa t'is{\'E}{\texttrademark}mthrow-SUBJ-ART
	child-OBJ house-INSTR rock `The child hit the house with a rock by
	throwing' (`The child threw a rock at the house') n{\'E}{\texttrademark}p'id-su?-i-da

	rock-OBJ house-INSTR child `The rock was what the child threw at
	the hause' eThe rock was . used for throwing at the house by the
	child')As with Malagasy, there are two different types of passive,
	one for the promotion of the Object, the other for the promotion
	of the oblique with markers -su?- and -ayu respectively. Levine,
	in fact, argues against a passive interpretation in favour of one
	in terms of `focus', but the constructions contain typical passive
	features, although it is, indeed, the case that there is some similarity
	between the systems of Malagasy and Kwakw'ala and those of `topic'
	lgs to be discussed in 6.4. p. 1275.4 Impersonal and `affected' passives
	In a number of languages there are passives of intransitive verbs;
	examples from Latin, German and Dutch are: Es wurde im Nebenzimmer
	geredet. It is almost certain, however, that this type of passive
	is restricted to what might be called `agentive' verbs (see 3.5.4)
	or what Perlmutter (1978) calls `unergative', where the single term
	S is an agent, .as contrasted with `unaccusative', where S is essentially
	a patient. Perlmutter and Postal (1984: 144) give an example from
	Welsh with the verb `dance', but note that Welsh does Dot permit
	the passivization of `grow': The simplest explanation for the fact
	that generally it is agentive intransitive verbs that are passivized
	may be round in Shibatani's suggestion (see the discussion in 6.7)
	that the primary function of the passive is defocusing' :which includes
	deletion) of the agent. Generally it is the Agent-Subject of transitives
	that is demoted or deleted; with intransitives is similarly deleted
	or demoted, but only if it is an agent.Alternatively, it might also
	be noted that these agentive verbs have unexpressed `cognate' Objects
	('fight a flight, `dance a dance' etc), and that in {English}, one
	can `have a fight / whistle/a dance / a swim', but not `*have a grow
	/ a drown'; notionally at least, these cognate objects might be considered
	to be the unexpressed Subjects of the passives (`(A fight) was fought'
	etc.); there is even some grammatical evidence for this in the constructions
	with the impersonal (`it') Subject, which might suggest the promotion
	of an unexpressed `it' (the cognate object) in the active.Impersonal
	passives are also round with verbs that have a second argument that
	is not marked as Object, but as an oblique term (the oblique term
	is not promoted, as in the examples of 5.3). Thus in Latin INVIDEO
	(`envy') is followed by the dative, not the accusative, but it has
	a passive (with the dative NP unchanged): The same is true of German:seine
	Freunde halfen ihm his friends helped him.DAT `His friends helped
	him' Ihm wurde von seinen Freunden geholfen him.DAT became by bis
	friends helped`He was helped by his friends.'{\ldots}There is a similar
	situation in Icelandic, where some verbs are followed by le dative,
	others by the genitive (Andrews 1982: 466-7):{\~A}{\textthreequarters}eir
	bj{\"o}rgu{\~A}{\textdegree}u st{\'u}lkunni they rescued girl.DAT
	`They rescued the girl' st{\'u}lkunni var bjarga{\~A}{\textdegree}
	girl.DAT was rescued `The girl was rescued' vi{\~A}{\textdegree}
	vitj{\~A}{\textdegree}um {\'O}lafs we visited Olaf.GEN `We visited
	Olaf.'{\'O}lafs var vitja{\~A}{\textdegree}Olaf.GEN was visited `Olaf
	was visited' Syntactically, the dative or genitive NP in the passive
	may function as a pivot, and is thus `treated as another example
	of `dative subject' (Andrews 1985: 122, but see the discussion in
	4.3): M{\'e}r var hj{\'a}lpa{\~A}{\textdegree} I.DAT was helped `I
	helped' min var vitja{\~A}{\textdegree} I.GEN was visited `I was
	visited' {\'E}g vonast tH ao vera hj{\^a}lpao/vitjao 1 hope towards
	to be helped/visited `1 hope to be helped' _ (But Andrews 1982: 467
	says that the last sentence is 4questionable for many speakers' .)
	. The issue is made more complex by the fact that, in sorne languages,
	there appear to be impersonal passives of transitive verbs, in which
	the Patient remains in the Object position and is not promoted to
	Subject, e.g. in Irish (Keenan 1985: 275): Bhuail si e Hit she him
	`She hit him' Buaileadh (lei) e Hit + IMPERS PASS (with ber) him
	`She was hit by him' {\ldots}:i. Song notes that there is a similar
	construction in Korean, but with a difference in that in the active
	the possessor may be indicated either in the gentive or, apparently,
	as a second Object (see 5.2): John-in ai-ii/IiI son-il jab-ossta
	n-TOP Child-GENjACC hand-Acc catch-PAST John grasped the child's
	band/the child by the band' Ai-nin John-ege son-il jab-hi-ossta Child-TOP
	John-DAT hand-Acc catch-PASS-PAST Rhe child was subjected to John's
	grasping his hand' (`The child's hand was held by John'?) Here it
	might appear that the passive is derived by simply promoting the
	second Object, but the first Object (`hand') cannot be similarly
	promoted, so that it may be simpler to treat this in the same way
	as the previous sentence, Le. As an adversity passive. 5.5 Passives
	and topicalization It is wise to exclude change of word order alone
	as a marker of the passive, even though word order is often the only
	formaI distinction between Subject and Object (and in {English} it
	is the most important feature, and the only one that is always present).
	The reason for excluding word order is that in many lgs it is used,
	independently of passivization, for the purpose of topicalization.
	Thus, even in {English} an Object may be placed in initial position
	for that purpose: This is not, however, restricted to Objects or
	even to NPs: Intelligent, he is not.{\ldots}It May also be added
	that in Greek and {English}, it does not acquire pivot status. There
	are, however, marginal and debatable cases. For instance, it was
	seen in 4.1.1 that in Lango it is the topicalized NP that controls
	deletion in coordination, but this topicalization is not accompanied
	by any markers on the verb, and it is the Subject that controls reflexives
	(4.1.4). ln any case, as was argued in 4.3, pivots should not be
	used as evidence for Subjects, and, a fortiorithey are not evidence
	for passivization. Another example of a construction about which
	there has been disagreement is to be found in Acehneset to be discussed
	in 6.2. A little more problematic is the situation in Kinyarwanda
	(Bantu, Kimenyi 1988: 357-8).This language has passives (discussed
	in 5.2 and 5.3), but it also has a device for interchanging Subject
	and Object, but with the additional point that the Object, when moved
	into Subject position, is the argument that agrees with the verb:
	abag{\'o}re ba-a-ri b{\^a}-teet-se ib{\'\i}shy{\'\i}imbo women they-PST-be
	they-cook-ASP beans `The women were cooking beans' (Kimenyi 1988:
	358)object-subject reversal:ib{\'\i}shy{\'\i}imbo by-aa-ri b{\^\i}-teet-se
	abag{\'o}re beans they-PST-be they-cook-ASP women `The beans were
	being cooked by the women.' (Kimenyi 1988: 358)Agreement with the
	verb is shown by the prefixes glossed by Kimenyi as `they'; in the
	first sentence they are appropriate to the class that includes `woman',
	in the second, to the class that includes `beans'. Kimenyi translates
	the second as if it were passive, rather than as `The beans, the
	women cooked', but it is better treated as a topicalization device
	rather than a passive, not only because Kinyarwanda has a quite different
	passive, but, more irnportantly, because there is, again, no passive
	marker on the verb. It was noted in 2.6 for Chichewa, another Bantu
	lg, that even locatives may be placed in initial position and agree
	with the verb. Although agreement marking of topicalized arguments
	is typologically unusual, these sentences in Kinyarwanda are better
	treated as examples of topicalization than of passivization. Alternatively,
	perhaps, an absolute distinction between passivization and topicalization
	should not be drawn; these constructions of Kinyarwanda have one
	of the marks of the passive, but lack the more crucial passive marking
	on the verb.Another problematic case is provided by Palauan (W. Austronesian,
	Foley and Van Valin 1985: 316-17). Here what appears to be a passive
	involves interchange of the positions of Agent and Patient and a
	set of special prefixes on the verb that agree with the passive Agent.
	(There is agreement with the Patient in both active and passive,
	but not, apparently with the agent of the active.) Examples are:
	a {\^E}”ad a mos-terir a ngalek ART man see-3pl.HUM ART child `The
	man saw the children' a ngalek a le-bos-terir a {\^E}”ad ART child
	PASS.3sg-see-3PL.HUM ART man `The children were seen by the man'
	Even oblique terms may, apparently, be promoted: a ngelek-ek a sme{\^E}”er
	er a tereter ART child-my sick.INTR with ART cold `My child is sick
	with a cold' a tereter a l-se{\^E}”er er ngiy a ngelek-ek ART cold
	PASS.3sg-sick with 3SG ART child-my `With a cold is being sick by
	my child' (`A cold is being sick with by my child'.)However, these
	are more like examples of topicalization than of passive: the Patient-Object
	unaffected and there is, therefore, no evidence that it is promoted
	to subject, and it is not abvious that the special prefix signaIs
	demotion of the Agent, since with demotion agreement is usually lost,
	not gained -- it may be that the function of the prefix is merely
	to make the status of the Agent-Subject explicit, because it has
	been moved from the usual Subject position. However, relativization
	on the Patient requires this `passive': a le-bos-terir a {\^E}”ad
	el ngalek ART PASS.3sg-see-3plHUM ART man REL child `The children
	which were seen by the man' It is not possible to say: *a {\^E}”ad
	a mos-terir el ngalek ART man see-3pl.HUM REL child `the children
	which the man saw'This rather looks like an example of passivization
	being used to promote the Patient-Object to Subject in a lg which
	permits relativization on Subjects only (see 4.6). Yet, this merely
	establishes a syntactic pivot and, as was argued in 4.3 pivots should
	not necessarily be equated with Subjects. There is a rather different
	problem in Dinka ( T. Andersen 1991), where there are two constructions,
	both of which have features of passives, as exemplified by (subscripted
	markers of creaky and breatby voice have been omitted): {\ldots}p.
	1365.6 Functions of the passive (i) It promotes a non-Subject to
	Subject position to make it available as a ' syntactic pivot. This
	use has already been discussed in sorne detail (4.6). (ii) Closely
	associated with this, especially with the use of pivots in coordination,
	is the promotion of a non-Agent for topicalization. (iii) The passive
	is often used, with the agent omitted, where the Agent is unknown,
	non-specific or unimportant.(iv) ln some lgs the passive is used
	because there are restrictions, in terms of animacy/agency etc.,
	on the type of entity that may function as the Subject of an active
	verbe Thus, according to Trithart (1979 -- see 4.6), passives are
	favoured in Bantu lgs if they promote to Subject an NP higher on
	a scale involving human/animate/inanimate. Conversely, as was noted
	in 2.2, a strong preference for animate Subjects may block the passive
	ln Korean, as in the example quoted by Song: John-{\'E}¨n k{\'E}¨
	sakwa-l{\'E}¨l m{\v o}g-{\v o}ssta John-TOP the apple-ACC eat-PST`John
	ate the apple' * k{\'E}¨ sakwa-n{\'E}¨n John-ege m{\v o}g-{\v o}sstathe
	apple-TOP John-DAT eat-PASS-PST `The apple was eaten by John'Klaiman
	(1988) argues that the issue in Korean is not one of animacy, but
	of control. She offers (p. 61), using a different transcription from
	that of Song, the examples: Id yAca-ka cA salamli tIN-ll kIlk-Assta
	That Woman-NOM that man's back + OBJ scratch-PAST He woman scratched
	the man's back' cA salam-Ii tIN-I kI yAca-eke kIlk-bi-Assta the man's
	back-NoM that woman-by scratch-PASS-PAST `That man's back was scratched
	by the woman' While the first sentence may mean that the woman scratched
	the man's back with or without him being willing, the second can
	only mean that the man let her scratch his back. In that sense he
	is in control of the action. However, notions of agency, control
	and animacy are conceptually closely linked, and it may be that all
	or any of them are often involve:p. 1385.7 Varieties of passive p.142Passive:
	related and problematic issues 6.1 Reflexives and indefinites as
	passives Many lgs have retlexive constructions, i.e. constructions
	in which the Object is indicated as being referentially identical
	with the Subject by means of a reflex ive pronoun. Examples are the
	{English} wash oneself, and the equivalent French se laver and Russian
	myt' s'a. ln a number of lgs the same construction is also used as
	a passive. In Russian, for instance, the passive is formed by using
	the copula (the verb `to be') with verbs in the perfective aspect,
	but by the reflexive fonn for verbs in the imperfective (SitWerska
	1985: 247): p. 1456.2 Other passive-like constructions Many lgs use
	an indetinite `they' or `he' l'one' as a Subject to convey a meaning
	similar to that of an Agent-less passive. Thus in {English} `they
	say . . .' has roughly the same meaning as `It is said . . . `. Similarly,
	for Lakhota (N. America), Foley and Van Valin (198S: 334) quote:
	{\ldots}However, in some languages there are constructions that are
	very like these, but are treated as passive in that an obliquely-marked
	Agent may be added; examples from Kimbundu (Bantu, Givon 1979: 211)
	and Trukic (Micronesian, Jacobs 1976: 121) both quoted in Shimtani
	1985: 845) are: Nzua a-mu-mono kwa marne .a :;me John they-him-saw
	by me `John was seen by me' Waan re-liila --`` ree- I John they-hirn-killed
	by-me `John was killed by me' },

	beyond 5, they are able to compare and add large approximate numbers
	that are far beyond their naming range. However, they fail in exact

  abstract = {Native speakers of two languages (English and Ndonga) were compared
	on three colour cognition tasks (sorting, triads and visual search)
	in a test of the linguistic relativity hypothesis (Whorf, 1956).
	The colour lexicons of these two languages differ because Ndonga
	has no basic terms for ORANGE, PINK and PURPLE, and stimuli were
	chosen to exploit this difference. On the sorting task (sorting into
	similarity-groups) for each language, nominally similar colours were
	grouped together more often than nominally dissimilar colours. On
	the triads task (choosing the most different of three colours), when
	the most nominally isolated colour differed for the two language-groups,
	each group tended to choose their nominal isolate. On the search
	task (scanning for target colours among distractors), targets were
	either in a different {English} category than distractors (cross-category),
	or some distractors were in the same {English} category as distractors
	(within-category). The 'cost' in speed of having within-category
	distractors was much greater for the {English} than for the Ndonga.
	Overall, these data suggest that a core universal component is modulated
	by a small relativist influence. The differences in the visual search
	task are consistent with language affecting pre-attentive processes
	(an indirect language effect) as well as exerting on-line influences
	(a direct effect).},

  month = {1},
  abstract = {Age-old socio-anthropology By LAL RAPACHA When one deeply ponders
	the dynamics of redefining socio-anthropological identification of
	the {Nepal}ese ethno-indigenous communities, s/he needs to be very
	critical and precautious about the trends of classification and literature
	available on them. Age-old or impressionistic rather than scientific
	notions of ethnological descriptions of those communities are customary
	amongst the native/foreign researchers and experts till today. One
	of such commonest instances is Professor Dor Bahadur Bista's ethnological
	descriptive efforts about the {Nepal}ese communities in the 'People
	of {Nepal}', though magnum opus is often taken for granted by researchers
	and experts in the history of socio-anthropology of {Nepal}. Many
	critics and reviewers have had praised his academic achievement at
	such a time of its publication when no one could think of such present
	pluri-ethnic groups in the country. Although Prof Bista is credited
	as the founder-father of socio-anthropology in {Nepal}, his knowledge
	on the people of {Nepal} now has seriously been questioned in an
	International Conference organized by Sociological/Anthropological
	Society of {Nepal} (SASON) held on 11-13 December 2006 in Administrative
	Staff College , Lalitpur. The Conference's main theme was 'Social
	Sciences in a Multicultural World: Addressing the Persistence of
	Deprivation, Conflict and Violence' with several other sub-themes
	like 'Ethnicity', 'Perspectives on Conflict and Social Movements',
	'Development Practices Observed', 'Political Transition, Democracy
	and Development', 'Gender', 'Cross Cutting Issues', Human Rights
	and Mental Health, 'Language and Culture', 'Resource Management',
	'Perspectives on Agriculture and Development' and so forth. It was
	in the 'ethnicity' sub-theme where Prof Bista, T. Ukyab and S. Akhikari
	and Kir?tologist Iman S Chemjong were inquired and criticized bitterly
	for claiming the {Kiranti}-K?its (hydro-exonym: Sunuwar) as "offshoots
	of the Magars" and their Mother Tongue slightly differing from "the
	Magar dialect". Actually their claims were the replica of Queen's
	Gurkha Officers such as E. Vansittart, W. B. Northey and C.J. Morris's
	writings on the {Kiranti}-K?its/Sunuwar during the British colonial
	imperialism. Socio-anthropology scarcely smells in their observations.
	Another most serious criticism in the conference was on Toni Hagen's
	definition of the ethno-indigenous Sunuwar people of Wallo Kirat,
	eastern {Nepal} "as excellent smiths and goldsmiths". Dr Hagen, who
	introduced {Nepal} with his work 'Nepal: A Kingdom in the {Himalayas}'
	has described them with such unscientific and inaccurate description
	on page 123 of the {English} version published in 1980 by IBH Publishing
	Co. The same faulty Hagen-notion has been imitated and reiterated
	by the native scholars like JP Ananda, RR Subedi et al, K Parajuli
	et al, MR Acharya, S Prapannacharya, Dr DP Aryal and Nanda R Shrestha/Keshav
	Bhattarai blindly in their voluminous works with out any rectifications
	or justifications. This scholarly copycat-trend has shown that socio-anthropology
	as the science of society the mankind seems to be worn out and needs
	to be revised in the true spirit of empirical science in present-day
	{Nepal}'s context. Socio-anthropology in {Nepal} facing much more
	criticisms these days is the classification and recognition of till
	unknown ethnic groups by National Foundation for Development of Nationalities
	(NFDIN) since sociologists/anthropologists are involved in the process
	exclusive of linguists. The recognition of {Kiranti}-Surel as a separate
	ethno-indigenous group having no separate language other than the
	dialect of {Kiranti}-K?its of its own has posed problems in the defining
	criteria of the term 'nationalities' whereas the {Kiranti}-Bakulochana
	(Banatawa, Bayung, {Kulung}, {Lohorung}, Chamling, Nachhiring and
	Yamphu) Movement has been voicing for a separate identity-recognition
	based on the criteria of their unique languages and cultural practices.
	Simply one Chepang ethnic group's division into three groups such
	as Praja, Chepang and Bankariya seems nothing more than ethno-politicization
	since the term Praja as an ethnic group was coined by King Mahendra's
	Model of Democracy. Bankariya is a recent phenomenon as is Surel.
	Furthermore, Dewans are also claiming as separate ethnic group either
	from Kirat- {Yakkha} or Kirat-Yakthung in eastern {Nepal}. The same
	problem of classification and recognition of some major tribes in
	the western hills of the country has remained as nationalities' riddles
	and even experts of sociology and anthropology are not exactly getting
	through it. The practice of socio-anthropology in {Nepal} at Tribhuvan
	University (TU) for more than four decades now is nothing more than
	cramming the definitions and explanations of 'society' and 'humans
	with certain sets of behaviors/features' provided by the Western
	scholars and Xeroxed in {Nepal}. There exists no laboratory for genome/DNA
	sampling observations and comparative analysis of anthropology as
	science. Anthropological linguistics as one of the most essential
	modules in socio-anthropological studies has not yet been introduced
	in the Masters course as inseparable component of Sociology/Anthropology
	in the University. As a result, most TU-products majoring Socio-anthropology
	are not easily motivated towards the innovative research in anthropology
	although it is very useful and relevant discipline for {Nepal}. Its
	main impacts are visible as darkness in the case of ethno-politicization
	among ethno-indigenous peoples of {Nepal} mocking science as puppet
	in the hand of crooked politicians if not politics. Doing innovative
	research is indispensable in order to understand and solve the riddles
	of nationalities' identification and recognition for their inclusive
	participation in political spheres demanded by the Federation of
	Nationalities. It should firstly be started with restructured and
	renovated paleontological ideas rather than from age-old socio-anthropological
	practice of {Nepal}. This makes SASON's international conference
	meaningful or socio-anthropology worth-practicing epistemologically
	as empirical science for the sake of human society free from deprivation,

	are organized around universal focal colors and that these focal
	colors tend to be chosen as the best examples of color terms across
	languages. However, this notion has been supported primarily by data
	from languages of industrialized societies. In contrast, recent research
	on a language from a nonindustrialized society has called this idea
	into question. We examine color-naming data from languages of 110
	nonindustrialized societies and show that (i) best-example choices
	for color terms in these languages cluster near the prototypes for
	{English} white, black, red, green, yellow, and blue, and (ii) best-example
	choices cluster more tightly across languages than do the centers
	of category extensions, suggesting that universal best examples (foci)
	may be the source of universal tendencies in color naming.},

  abstract = {English and Russian color terms divide the color spectrum differently.
	Unlike {English}, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between
	lighter blues ("goluboy") and darker blues ("siniy"). We investigated
	whether this linguistic difference leads to differences in color
	discrimination. We tested {English} and Russian speakers in a speeded
	color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy
	border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate
	two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in
	Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from
	the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy). Moreover,
	this category advantage was eliminated by a verbal, but not a spatial,
	dual task. These effects were stronger for difficult discriminations
	(i.e., when the colors were perceptually close) than for easy discriminations
	(i.e., when the colors were further apart). {English} speakers tested
	on the identical stimuli did not show a category advantage in any
	of the conditions. These results demonstrate that (i) categories
	in language affect performance on simple perceptual color tasks and
	(ii) the effect of language is online (and can be disrupted by verbal
	interference).},
