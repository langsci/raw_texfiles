%\vv{Veronika's comment}
Multiword expressions (MWEs) belong to those language phenomena which pose the hardest challenges both in linguistic modelling and in automatic processing. This is due notably to their semantic non-compositionality, that is, %i.e. 
the impossibility to predict their meaning from their syntactic structure and from the semantics of their component words in a way deemed regular for the given language. But MWEs also exhibit unpredictable behaviour on other levels of language modelling such as the lexicon, morphology and syntax, and call, therefore, for dedicated procedures in natural language processing (NLP) applications.

These challenges have been addressed by an ever-growing and increasingly multilingual community  gathering at the Multiword Expressions Workshop, organized yearly since 2003, often jointly with major NLP conferences. 
The 13th edition of the Workshop, co-located with the EACL 2017 conference in Valencia, Spain, saw a major evolution of the topics and methods addressed by the community. This evolution resulted notably from the efforts coordinated by PARSEME, a European research network dedicated to parsing and MWEs, gathering, since 2013,  researchers from 31 countries and working on as many languages.\footnote{\url{http://www.parseme.eu}} %\vv{Shall we put the footnote to the end of the sentence?}

One of PARSEME's main outcomes was a corpus in 18 languages annotated for verbal MWEs, based on a unified methodology and terminology, % according to unified terminologies and methodologies, 
and published under open licenses. This considerable collective and inclusive effort mobilized experts from different linguistic traditions, triggered cross-language and cross-domain discussions, and brought convergence to modelling and processing of MWE-related phenomena. The availability of this %the 
new open resource also made it possible to organize the PARSEME Shared Task on Automatic Identification of Verbal Multiword Expressions, whose culminating event was hosted by the MWE 2017 workshop in Valencia. The 7 participating systems covered jointly all 18 languages represented in the corpus. They also offered a large panorama of VMWE identification techniques. These assets, as well as some other contributions published in the main track of the MWE 2017 workshop, showed a growing awareness by the MWE community of specific challenges posed, in particular, 
%notably \sm{the adverb \textit{notably} has been  used 3 times so far} 
by verbal MWEs, such as their discontinuity and high morpho-syntactic flexibility. The workshop program addressed a large variety of MWE-dedicated tasks such as: lexical and grammatical encoding, annotation, tokenization, extraction, identification, classification, variation study, parsing, compositionality prediction, and translation. Finally, it testified that MWE research has reached a highly multilingual stage.

\section{Organization and contents of the volume}

This volume is a collection of selected extended papers from the MWE 2017 workshop in Valencia: 8 of them from the main track, and 5 from the shared task track. They address 19 languages from 9 language families, as shown in \figref{preface:fig:language-tree}.\footnote{When specific dialects of these languages are addressed (e.g.~Brazilian Portuguese), they are explicitly mentioned in the language index (cf.~\pageref{??}).}
%\sm{Which language index is this? Is it section 4 in this introductory chapter that gives abbreviations or is it the language index of the book which says the pages where each language is mentioned?}
The chapter selection process was initiated by an open call, addressed to all co-authors of the workshop papers. The call included %and including
the requirement of extending the original contributions by at least 30\% with unpublished content. An %The 
international program committee reviewed 15 submissions and selected 14 of them for publication. One of the selected chapters was further withdrawn. As a result, the volume consists of 13 chapters covering a large variety of aspects related to  MWE representation and processing, with a particular focus on verbal MWEs.

%Mention PARSEME.
%Address the specific challenges behind verbal MWEs. Breakthrough in this domain via the PARSEME corpus annotation project and the shared task. Stress the huge collective and highly multilingual effort. MWE research is now more deeply grounded in the multilingual data. }

%The first three chapters 
Chapters \ref{GEERAERT-CHAPTER} to \ref{BHATIA-CHAPTER}
address outstanding linguistic properties of VMWEs and their automatic assessment. \citetv{Geeraerttv}  discuss idiomatic \emph{variation}\is{variation} of several types of English verbal idioms. They %assess its acceptability via psycholinguistic experiments based on rating and eye-tracking experiments 
draw on multimodal evidence, namely acceptability rating and eyetracking measurements, to investigate comprehension mechanisms. \citetv{Barancikovatv} deal with light-verb constructions and verbal idioms in Czech, and explore their \emph{paraphrasability}\is{paraphrasability} by single verbs. They also propose a lexicographic scheme for VMWE paraphrase encoding, and show its usefulness in machine translation. \citetv{Bhatiatv}  focus on English verb-particle constructions, and estimate their \emph{compositionality}\is{compositionality} degree, so as to further compute the semantics of sentences containing verb-particle constructions %VPCs, 
on the basis of lexical, grammatical and ontological resources.

Chapters \ref{SAVARY-CHAPTER} to \ref{SIMKO-CHAPTER} %\sm{needs to be taken care of when the whole book is compiled} 
are dedicated to the PARSEME shared task on automatic identification of verbal MWEs. \citetv{Savarytv} describe %address 
the PARSEME multilingual VMWE-annotated corpus underlying the shared task. First, the annotation guidelines and methodology are presented, then 
%\sm{I would use \textit{as well as} if an \textit{and} connecting verbs  existed. However, the existing \textit{and} connects nouns.} 
the properties of the annotated corpus are analysed across the 18 participating languages. \citetv{Maldonadotv} offer a critical analysis of the shared task organization and of its results across languages and participating systems. The following three chapters %Chapters MOREAU-CHAPTER--ALSAIED-CHAPTER 
are dedicated to three of the seven %7
VMWE identification systems participating in the shared task. They show a representative panorama of recent techniques used to address the VMWE identification task. \citetv{Moreautv}  model the task as sequence labelling with re-ranking. \citetv{Simkotv}  rely on a generic dependency parser trained on a corpus with merged syntactic and VMWE labels. Finally, \citetv{AlSaiedtv} present a dedicated transition-based dependency parser, which jointly predicts a syntactic dependency tree and a forest of VMWEs. 

Chapters \ref{BROOKE-CHAPTER} to \ref{TASLIMIPOOR-CHAPTER} further discuss MWE identification issues in various settings and scopes. \citetv{Brooketv} show how comparing various annotations of the same MWE in an English corpus can help correct annotation errors, enhance the consistency of corpus annotation, and consequently increase the quality of downstream MWE identification systems. \citetv{Scholivettv} address identification of French continuous MWEs via sequence labelling, compare its results to more sophisticated parsing-based approaches, and show that feature engineering based on external lexical data (whether hand-crafted or automatically extracted) systematically enhances the tagging performance. \citetv{Taslimipoortv}, conversely, advocate 
%in favor \sm{either \textit{argue in favor} or \textit{advocate}} of 
modelling MWE identification as classification rather than tagging. They exploit word embeddings as classification features in Italian, Spanish and English, and put forward a MWE-specific methodology of train vs.~test corpus split.

The last two chapters of the book, \ref{GARCIA-CHAPTER} and \ref{SALEHI-CHAPTER}, %this volume % TO AVOID PAGE OVERFLOW of "MWE-oriented"
are dedicated to multilingual MWE-oriented applications. \citetv{Garciatv} describes automatic extraction of bilingual collocation equivalents in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, using
syntactic dependencies, association measures and distributional models. Finally, \citetv{Salehitv}  predict the compositionality of English and German MWEs on the basis of their translations extracted from highly multilingual lexical resources. 

%\as{Explain how the volume is organized (add a sentence about each chapter), i.e. chapter clusters: (i) more linguistic papers which discuss the nature of MWEs and provide background for more computationally-oriented papers; within papers of the same type, we use alphabetical order, (ii) verbal MWEs: 12, 5, 10, 9, (iii) shared task papers:

\section{Conventions for citing and glossing multilingual MWE examples}
%\section{Notational conventions}

 As mentioned above, this volume addresses a large number of languages, particularly in the chapters related to the PARSEME corpus and shared task. Therefore, the editorial effort around this volume includes putting forward notational conventions which might become a standard for citing and glossing multilingual MWE examples.
%Some chapters cite MWE examples in several languages. These multilingual \emph{numbered examples}, as (\ref{preface:en:take-on}) to (\ref{preface:fa:have-sleep-for-sb}), contain: 
We illustrate the proposed conventions by the \emph{numbered examples}  (\ref{preface:en:take-on}) to (\ref{preface:fa:have-sleep-for-sb}). Each numbered example contains:%They  contain:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]%[label=(\roman*)]
\item\label{ex-line:use} a sample use of the VMWE, followed by the 2-letter ISO 639-1 language code (cf.~\figref{preface:fig:language-tree}),
%(cf. the list of abbreviations p.~\pageref{sec:lang-codes}),\sm{if we retain section four for the codes, should the reference be that of a section?}

\item\label{ex-line:transcription} a transcription, if the language of the example is written with a script different from the one used for the main text,
%a non-Latin alphabet, 
%\sm{Well, this is a very "Stella-like" comment: I would suggest something like \textit{if a language has is written with an alphabet different than the alphabet used for the main text (the main text of this book is written in the Latin alphabet)} because the scripture of a language is part of a nation's identity rather than being a kind of deviation from the norm, something that might be inferred from the existing wording; as I said, this is a very Stella-like comment and you might find it exaggerated.}
\footnote{For instance, transcription is needed for Bulgarian, Greek, Farsi and Hebrew examples in this volume. Conversely, examples in English, or any other language using Latin script, would require transcriptions %be needed 
in texts written in Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic or Hebrew script.}

\item\label{ex-line:gloss} a gloss %according to 
following 
the Leipzig Glossing Rules,\footnote{\url{https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/pdf/Glossing-Rules.pdf}} 

\item\label{ex-line:trans} a literal translation, followed by an idiomatic translation in single quotes. 
\end{enumerate}

For English examples, items (\ref{ex-line:transcription})--(\ref{ex-line:trans}) are irrelevant or optional but idiomatic translation might sometimes be useful to ease the comprehension by non-native readers. For right-to-left languages (e.g. Farsi or Hebrew), item (\ref{ex-line:use}) is spelled right-to-left, item (\ref{ex-line:trans}) left-to-right and items (\ref{ex-line:transcription})--(\ref{ex-line:gloss}) left-to-right within components, and right-to-left from one component to another. 
Lexicalized components of the VMWE, i.e. those which are always realized by the same lexeme (cf. \citetv{Savarytv} \secref{sec:def-scope}, p. \pageref{sec:def-scope}) are highlighted in bold face. 

%\begin{exe}

%\end{exe}

%These examples are to be typeset by the dedicated LSP commands, e.g. example (\ref{preface:el:take-decision}) is typeset like this:

%\begin{verbatim}
%\ea \label{preface:el:take-decision}
%\settowidth \jamwidth{(EL)} 
%\glll Œó ŒñœâŒÆ \lex{œÄŒ±ŒØœÅŒΩŒµŒπ} ŒºŒØŒ± \lex{Œ±œÄœåœÜŒ±œÉŒ∑}. \\

%\jambox{(EL)}
%\glt Zoe takes a decision. `Zoe makes a decision.'
%\z
%\end{verbatim}


\emph{In-line examples}, used for brevity, are preceded by the 2-letter language code, contain items (\ref{ex-line:use}), (\ref{ex-line:transcription}) if relevant, and (\ref{ex-line:trans}) only, and the idiomatic translation (if any) is introduced by a double arrow `$\Rightarrow$'. For instance, an in-line example corresponding to numbered example (\ref{preface:sl:skrivati-glavo-v-pesek}) would be the following: (SL) \exlitidio{Ida \lex{skriva} \lex{glavo} \lex{v} \lex{pesek}}{Ida hides her head in the sand}{Ida pretends not to see a problem}. 
%
If the language under study is written with a non-Latin alphabet, the inline example should not be in italics, and the transliteration should be included in parentheses, e.g. (EL) \nlextlilitidio{Œó ŒñœâŒÆ \lex{œÄŒ±ŒØœÅŒΩŒµŒπ} ŒºŒØŒ± \lex{Œ±œÄœåœÜŒ±œÉŒ∑}}{I Zoi perni mia apofasi}{The Zoe takes a decision}{Zoe makes a decision}. To keep such examples reasonably short, the first item can be omitted and only the transliterated example is kept: (EL) \nltlilitidio{I Zoi perni mia apofasi}{The Zoe takes a decision}{Zoe makes a decision}. 
%
The literal or the idiomatic translation are sometimes superfluous or too verbose, and can be skipped, as in:  (EL) \nltliidio{I Zoi perni mia apofasi}{Zoe makes a decision}. 

The typesetting commands for both numbered and in-line examples for \LaTeX~can be found in the GitHub repository containing the source codes of this volume, accessible from its webpage.\footnote{\url{http://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/??}} %TO COMPLETE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

%In-line examples are to be typeset by commands specific to this volume, defined in the \texttt{localcommands.tex} file. For instance, the four last examples are typeset as follows:

%\begin{small}
%\begin{verbatim}
%(SL) \exlitidio{Ida \lex{skriva} \lex{glavo} \lex{v} \lex{pesek}}
%{Ida hides her head in the sand}{Ida pretends not to see a problem} 
%(EL) \nlextlilitidio{Œó ŒñœâŒÆ \lex{œÄŒ±ŒØœÅŒΩŒµŒπ} ŒºŒØŒ± \lex{Œ±œÄœåœÜŒ±œÉŒ∑}}

%{Zoe makes a decision}
%(EL) \nltliidio{I zoi perni mia apofasi}{Zoe makes a decision
%\end{verbatim}

\section{Acknowledgements}
Huge collective efforts paved the way towards the publication of this volume. 

The PARSEME shared task on automatic identification of VMWEs was made possible by the European research network PARSEME\footnote{\url{http://www.parseme.eu}}, funded by the IC1207 COST\footnote{\url{http://www.cost.eu/}} Action in 2013-2017. The PARSEME core group and eighteen language teams (cf.~acknowledgements in \citetv{Savarytv}) prepared the annotation guidelines and tools, and created the multilingual corpus underlying the shared task.
