This volume was only possible thanks to the contributions of many institutions and individuals, including the following:

The Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung funded this research through a grant jointly awarded to Geoffrey Haig (Bamberg) and Mohammad Rasekh-Mahand (Hamedan), 2020--2023 (Post-predicate elements in Iranian and neighbouring languages: Inheritance, contact, and \isi{information structure}).

Nils Schiborr implemented and maintained the companion website Word Order in Western Asia (WOWA).

The final compilation and editing of the volume would not have been possible without the assistance of Shuan Osman Karim (Cambridge, Würzburg), who went well beyond the call of duty in coordinating technical and content-related issues for a complex manuscript through all stages of production.

The editors of the Series Contact and Multilingualism, Isabelle Léglise and Stefano Manfredi, supported the proposal from the outset, and Sebastian Nordhoff of Language Science Press supervised the final production.

We are exceedingly grateful to our many colleagues whose constructive and critical reviews have transformed this work into its current form.

Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to speakers of around 50 under-researched languages from Western Asia for generously sharing their knowledge of those languages, without which this work would not have been possible. \\
