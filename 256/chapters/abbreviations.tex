\addchap{List of abbreviations}

For a better reading experience I tried to avoid abbreviations in the main text as much as possible.\\

\noindent\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\textsc{bem} &  Benefactive Marker \\
DGS & German Sign Language (\textit{Deutsche Geb\"ardensprache})\\
FLB & Language Faculty in the broad sense\\
FLN & Language Faculty in the narrow sense\\
LF & Logical Form \\
\textsc{pam} & Person Agreement Marker \\
PF & Phonological Form \\
\textsc{p-ug} & palm-up gesture\\
UG & Universal Grammar \\
\end{tabular}
