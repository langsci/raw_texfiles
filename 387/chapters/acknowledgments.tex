This book is a revised version of my dissertation that I presented for review in December 2020 and defended on June 3rd, 2021 at the Free University of Berlin. Uli Reich encouraged me to pursue it and supported me at every stage of the process. Thank you, Uli. Timo Buchholz discussed almost every page with me. Judith Meinschaefer asked the right questions at the right time and always reminded me to think not only about my subject, but about the field as a whole. I also thank the reviewers for their insightful comments, and the members of the Research Colloquium Romance Linguistics at the Free University of Berlin for providing me with a platform for the continuous development of my ideas. The staff at Alcalá University, in particular María Sancho Pascual and the PRESEEA Madrid group, as well as the study participants deserve a special mention. Maria del Mar Vanrell, Paolo Roseano, Christoph Gabriel, Wendy Elvira-García, and Clara Huttenlauch provided pivotal insights for my prosodic analysis. Johannes Schneider helped me model discourse phenomena. All the shortcomings of the book remain, of course, my own.
