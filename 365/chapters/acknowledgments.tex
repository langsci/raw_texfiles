Thank you to Ingo Plag and Dinah Baer-Henney. Without your ideas my dissertation, of which this book is a slightly altered version, would not have been possible. Thank you for your invaluable expertise and enthusiasm, for listening to my ideas and questions, and for providing a constant flow of new input. Thank you for guiding me through my PhD and for pushing me to sharpen my thinking.

Thank you to Arne Lohmann, who always had an open door and open ear for my questions.

Thank you to everyone in the DFG research unit Spoken Morphology for listening to talks on word-final /s/ over and over again, and for giving me insightful feedback. 

Thank you to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for funding the research unit, giving me the opportunity to fully concentrate on my research.

Thank you to James White and Andrew Nevins for giving me the opportunity to run my production experiment at Chandler House, University College London, and to Andrew Clark for his technical support.

Thank you to Yu-Ying Chuang for providing help, support, and valuable input on my linear discriminative learning implementation. Without your input my LDL study would not have been possible.

Thank you to Jennifer Hay for making it possible to conduct my perception and comprehension experiments at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, and to Wakayo Mattingley and Gia Hurring who run them on site. Thank you to Jessie Nixon for providing recordings for the experiments. I am very grateful for your help in times of global turmoil.

Thank you to everyone in the English linguistics department at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf. A great team of colleagues makes working on your PhD much easier. A special thanks to Viktoria, Simon, and Marie who listened to my complaints, and provided feedback and food for thought wherever and whenever necessary.

Thank you to Julika, Sally, Jennifer, Lisa-Marie, Ann-Sophie, Nina, and Lukas for the countless hours you spent in front of Praat, for pilot-testing my perception and comprehension experiments, and for proofreading my work.

Thank you to my best friend, Janina, who provided invaluable mathematical insight and stimulating discussions as well as happy distractions to rest my mind outside my research.

Thank you to my family for having faith in me, for your sympathetic ear, and for reminding me that there is more than word-final /s/ in the world.

Thank you to my partner, Dennis, for your love, patience, and support, and most of all, for always believing in me.
