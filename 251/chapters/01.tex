\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:1}

Synchronic and diachronic linguistics are typically pursued as separate
disciplines, with little to no overlap. Nevertheless, it is not possible
for either to be truly agnostic about the form of the other. This
is necessarily true because \isi{synchronic} theories are not theories about
attested languages, but theories about possible languages. Therefore,
any possible language, undergoing any series of diachronic changes,
must always end up as another member of the set of possible \isi{synchronic}
languages. Conversely, a theory of the end state of diachronic change
is necessarily a theory of a \isi{synchronic} grammar at some point in time.
The actuators of change must also be latently present in some way
within \isi{synchronic} states, just as the speakers of daughter languages
must have been learners of mother languages.

In this work I will demonstrate how deeply held assumptions about
the correct representations of \isi{synchronic} grammars delimit an associated
theory of diachrony, and how standard assumptions about the units
of change disallow certain \isi{synchronic} states. I will argue that it
is necessary to reconsider the operative units within both domains,
and that in doing so we are likely to gain new insights into how linguistic
structures change and, by extension, how they fail to change, i.e.,
exhibit stable variation.

The goal of this work is to determine what types of mental structures
may be sufficient, and, possibly, necessary in order to capture certain
linguistic phenomena at a computational level of description (in the
sense of \citealt{marr1982vision}). The approach is twofold: 1) to
test a number of proposed structures and mechanisms by implementing
them in simple computational models; and 2) to test the explanatory
adequacy of a number of existing models by transforming their implementations
into theoretical constructs. The first method is likely to be familiar
to many readers; the second, however, is somewhat novel, and requires
some explanation. In the simplest terms, it is the reverse of the
first: taking implemented functions and deriving the theoretical linguistic
entity that the function implements. This requires determining whether
a specific implementational detail is incidental (with no repercussions
beyond the implementational level), or whether there are hidden ramifications
to that choice at the level of linguistic theory (the computational
level). There is a second aspect to this analysis as well. Models,
to be useful, as well as tractable, must be simplifications of what
are extremely complex systems. The simplifications, however, must
be of the right kind to ensure that the model is still informative
about the phenomenon of interest. That is, the model must be able
to “scale up”. There is no algorithm, however, by which we can
establish scalability ahead of time in building our toy models. Thus,
it is critical that any model be made consistent with what is known
more globally about the phenomenon of interest (what I will refer to as ``imposing
boundary conditions''), and not just the small piece it was designed
to explain. 

As a series of models are developed and tested, they will be assessed
as to whether or not they meet the relevant boundary conditions in
an internally consistent, theoretically motivated way. This higher-level
model analysis will reveal the covert representational corollaries
of various modeling choices, providing insight, in turn, into both
sufficient and necessary components of a working theory of language
stability and change. This approach is also an illustration of the
utility of an intensively fine-grained local analysis in approaching
the largest and most general of theoretical questions. Although the
phenomena modeled are \isi{phonetic} and \isi{phonological} ones, the methodology
is applicable to any domain of linguistics. 

This book is organized as follows. In the remainder of this chapter\largerpage
the representational issues that apply in both the \isi{synchronic} and
the diachronic domains are introduced. \chapref{ch:The-Exemplar-Model}
describes the basic architecture from which the models are built.
To begin with, three general types of phenomena are modeled: a gradient
context-free process, a gradient context-dependent process, and a
categorical context-dependent process. Simulations for all three demonstrate
that iterated processes without check lead to collapse, or unbounded
category shift. Furthermore, \isi{production} modeled as random selection
of \isi{unnormalized} perceptual inputs leads to sub-category mismatch.
\chapref{ch:The-Linguistic-Phenomena} makes explicit links
between these general model types and specific linguistic phenomena,
namely, word \isi{frequency} effects, vowel \isi{lengthening}, and \isi{vowel nasalization}.
In \chapref{ch:Models-of-Change}, \isi{articulatory} targets are introduced
to the basic model in order to check unbounded shift. A set of models
with targets of various kinds are analyzed in depth. The set is generated
by selecting parameters along two dimensions: whether \isi{production} tokens
are stored or generated (\noun{state/process}); and whether more than
one level of representation is used (category/sub-category). In this
chapter it is shown that only two models from this set satisfy the
criteria of being both representationally consistent and bounded.
The possible states for each of the two models is then fully derived.
These results are related to existing models, and the types of sound
change that they are capable of capturing. In \chapref{ch:Perception-Production}, 
it is shown that the typical implementational simplification, in which
\isi{perception} and \isi{production} tokens are equated, is not only implausible,
but obscures a fundamental flaw in the mechanism for change. Iterative
change no longer follows once an explicit mapping between acoustic
values and \isi{articulatory} gestures is required. \chapref{ch:Phoneme-Split}
is devoted to a type of change not previously modeled: the genesis
of a new \isi{phoneme} category. Adopting a theory in which the mapping
from \isi{perception} to \isi{production} is taken to be inherently ambiguous,
I offer a proposal for an implemented model in which variable \isi{sub-lexical}
segmentation results in mixed representations. Change in the model
is taken to be change in the distribution of already existing variants.
The work is summarized in \chapref{ch:Summary},
where other types of sound change, and future avenues of research,
are briefly discussed. 

\section{Abstract representations}\largerpage

One of the basic representational divisions that can be made in a
theory of cognition is between what is stored in memory versus what
is not stored, and thus must be computed (or generated). The choice
about what aspects of a linguistic pattern to treat as stored versus
generated will determine, to quite a large extent, what we take to
be the possible dimensions of \isi{synchronic variation} cross-linguistically,
as well as the possible diachronic outcomes. This will be the focus
of \chapref{ch:Models-of-Change}, where I will also show that
this choice can imply a number of other representational assumptions.
In this section, I preview that analysis by deconstructing some of
the most basic units of \isi{phonological} theory.

It should be noted that mainstream \isi{synchronic} linguistics is heavily
biased towards conceptualizing phenomena as generating processes:
“\isi{vowel nasalization}”, “final de-voicing”, “initial
aspiration”, etc.\footnote{Even if these are merely terminological conveniences, they color the
way we think about, and model, these phenomena.} This is directly linked to a conception of mental representations
as maximally abstract. In other words, only unpredictable information
should be stored (such as the arbitrary sound units associated with
a given lexical item), while all predictable information should be
derived. Although this view may have originated with \citet{Chomsky1968},
it has also been explicitly advocated for much more recently in various
theories of underspecification (e.g., \citealt{archangeli1988aspects,Steriade1995a}).
More commonly, however, it is an unexpressed assumption that the analysis
that maximizes the predictive power of the grammar is the preferred
one.\footnote{Within Optimality Theory, this pressure is, in a sense, even stronger,
because all possible words must be filtered through the grammar (not
just the selected URs). However, Lexicon Optimization allows for known
lexical items to be generated from faithful inputs allowing for some
predictability to be retained in the lexicon (\citealt{Prince2004}:
Ch. 9). }

For example, the pronunciation of the word \textit{lamb} in English
can be written with the following series of \isi{phonetic} symbols: {[læ̃m]},
where the diacritic over the vowel indicates \isi{nasalization}. The property
of \isi{nasalization}, however, is predictable in English, and only occurs
when vowels are produced in proximity to nasal consonants, like {[}m{]}.
The lexical entry for \textit{lamb} is therefore denoted as {/læm/},
without the \isi{nasalization}. Concomitantly, a pronunciation rule must
be internalized by the native English speaker, a rule that stipulates
that any vowels adjacent to nasal consonants must become nasalized.
Under this theory, the lexical item {/læm/} is first retrieved,
and then transformed to {[læ̃m]} via the application of
this rule. 

This hypothesis in fact implies that the lexical entry is comprised
of a string of smaller units, the phonemes {/l/}, {/æ/},
and {/m/}, that are concatenated together in order to produce
the word. The currently standard view of \isi{phonological} structure is
that there exists an entire hierarchy of abstract units wherein larger
units are successively built from smaller ones: phonemes from features,
syllables from phonemes, words from syllables, etc. At each level,
the units of the previous level undergo rules affecting their realization.
The unit of interest in a particular analysis will depend on the phenomenon
of interest. But that unit cannot exist independently of the rest
of the hierarchy. Consider the dual nature of the \isi{phoneme} {/æ/}
as part of an abstract category {/æ/}, but also as part
of the word \textit{lamb}. The variant, or \isi{allophone}, of the \isi{phoneme}
that occurs in that word is nasalized. However, the rule that nasalizes
the {/æ/} is assumed to operate at a more abstract level,
i.e., before any nasal, in any word and, in fact, on any
vowel. See (\ref{allophony:nasal vowel}). 
\begin{covexample}
\emph{\label{allophony:nasal vowel}/vowel/ $\rightarrow$ {[}nasalized
vowel{]}/\_\_ {[}nasal{]}}
\end{covexample}
Many phonemes can be said to have multiple \isi{phonological} allophones,
and all phonemes have at least multiple \isi{phonetic} allophones. In the
word \textit{tag} {[tʰæˑɡ˺}{]}, for example, the first
sound can be characterized as the aspirated \isi{allophone} of {/t/}
that is generated whenever a \isi{voiceless} plosive occurs in the onset
of a stressed syllable; the second sound is the lengthened \isi{allophone}
of {/æ/} that is generated whenever a vowel precedes a \isi{voiced}
obstruent; and the third sound is the unreleased \isi{allophone} of {/ɡ/}
that is generated whenever a plosive occurs in word-final position. 

A consequence of abstract representations that do not match produced
surface forms is that a \isi{normalization} procedure is required on the
\isi{perception} side for successful recognition and retrieval. The actually
heard {[læ̃m]} does not match the stored representation
{/læm/}, and must be converted by somehow subtracting out,
or “compensating” for, the predictable \isi{nasality}. As far as I
am aware, there is no standard notation for formalizing the input
(or \isi{perception}) side of the \isi{allophonic} relationship. Therefore, I
use the special symbol $\hookrightarrow$ to denote the inference
of the underlying form in (\ref{Normalization}), the inverse of (\ref{allophony:nasal vowel}). 
\begin{covexamples}
\item \label{Normalization} \emph{{[}nasalized vowel{]}{[}nasal{]}}
$\hookrightarrow$ \emph{/vowel//nasal/}
\end{covexamples}
Once performed, the recovered form should be identical to the stored
category. Thus, from the generative perspective, category matching
is trivial, and the difficult part of speech recognition is the \isi{normalization}
process. Note that the more rules there are, and the more complex
their interaction, the more complicated the \isi{normalization} procedure
becomes.\footnote{The real speech \isi{perception} problem, of course, is much more difficult
than simply accounting for all the \isi{phonetic} and \isi{phonological} predictability.
There are numerous other factors that affect the realization of a
given utterance, such as vocal tract \isi{length}, \isi{speaking rate}, ambient
noise, speaker sex, speech community, register, etc. At minimum, \isi{normalization}
of all these factors requires a complex non-linear function, and is
unlikely to have a unique solution.} 

\section{\label{sec:Actuation-1}Actuation}

A commonly described sound change is one in which a sound that was
previously an \isi{allophone} becomes a \isi{phoneme} in its own right (\isi{phoneme}
split). Vowel \isi{nasalization} is considered to be \isi{allophonic} in English,
and was also \isi{allophonic} at some point in the history of French. The
\isi{allophonic} rule entailed that a word like {/bɔn/} would be
pronounced as {[bɔ̃n]}. According to the classical view,
loss of nasal consonants like the one in {[bɔ̃n]}, resulted
in words like {[bɔ̃]}, where the nasalized variant was
no longer predictable (e.g., \citealt{Hajek1997a}). In theory, a
minimal pair was now possible where the only difference between the
word pairs was whether the vowel was oral or nasal, e.g., {[bɔ̃]}
versus {[bɔ]}. 

This story creates a paradox within the constraints of the representational
framework just described. If \isi{nasalization} is predictable, then it
is added by rule to an abstract underlying form, such as {/bɔn/}.
If the final nasal is dropped by the speaker, then there should be
no \isi{nasalization} on the vowel, and no way to arrive at a phonemically
nasalized vowel.\footnote{In fact, it is possible to achieve the necessary outcome if the nasal
is dropped by the speaker only \emph{after} the \isi{allophonic} rule has
been applied. This move, however, requires a theory of serially ordered
rules in the first place, and, in the second, raises other difficulties
in terms of theoretical constraints on the ordering of those rules,
and what types of rules are allowed to occur before or after others.}
If the final nasal is not dropped by the speaker, but fails to be
heard by the listener, a different problem arises. A listener provided
with the input sequence {[bɔ̃]} ought to infer, based on
their native language competence, that they failed to hear a nasal
consonant that was actually produced, given that vowels are only ever
nasalized preceding a nasal consonant. In fact, they ought to be able
to infer, based on the conversational context and their knowledge
of lexical items, that the \isi{target} was \textit{bon}, and thus correct
for any performance errors in \isi{production} or \isi{perception}.

The causality in this story can be reversed, where the loss of the
nasal, rather than being the actuating event, merely reveals (to the
linguist) that the nasalized vowel has already become phonemic (e.g.,
\citealt{Janda2003}). This ``covert change'' approach, however, merely
pushes the explanation back a step – how did the vowel become phonemically
nasal? And in either story the Actuation Problem (\citealt{Labov1968})
remains unsolved. What is required is a mechanism by which predictability
can be lost at the \isi{allophonic} level. Furthermore, the mechanism itself
must be predictable; that is, it must either always apply (yet only
occasionally lead to sound change), or it must apply under specific
well-understood conditions.

\section{\label{sec:Less-abstract-Representations}Less-abstract representations}\largerpage

Even within a maximally abstract system it will be necessary to deal
with multiple representational levels in a way that is obscured by
the notational conventions used above. For example, a \isi{phoneme split}
was said to require predictability to be lost at the \isi{allophonic} level.
But, in fact, what is really needed is the loss of predictability
at a hyper-\isi{allophonic} level, such as that expressed in (\ref{allophony:nasal vowel})
– which will be symbolized as $[\tilde{V}]$ going forward. And because
neither phonemes, allophones, or hyper-allophones exist in isolation,
whatever mechanism is proposed must act through the medium of actual
words. Furthermore, sound change has been observed to be gradual from
a \isi{phonetic} point of view, such that relatively small differences in
pronunciation can be seen to incrementally increase across speakers
of different ages in a “sound change in progress”. These small
differences are reflected in what may be stable differences between
different dialects, between male and female speakers, between speakers
of higher socioeconomic and lower socioeconomic status, etc. It is
now widely accepted, in fact, that the pool of \isi{phonetic} variants that
exists across a heterogeneous population of speakers provides the
basis for future sound changes (e.g., \citealt{Guy2008}).

For these reasons, an alternative framework in which mental representations
are far closer to actually produced forms, retaining significant detail
at both the acoustic and \isi{phonetic} levels, has arisen in the study
of sound change. Exemplar models were first developed in the field
of psychology, in order to reflect a number of insights about human
memory and categorization. Rather than having clear, definable boundaries,
many mental categories seemed to function much more as though they
were a reflection of their current members (e.g., \citealt{Rosch1977}).
Categorization of novel items was less a question of logical inference,
than of similarity to known instances. Furthermore, many dimensions
of similarity were potentially implicated, not all of which were relevant
from a taxonomic point of view (\citealt{Nosofsky1988,Luce1986}).
Within linguistics, \isi{exemplar} models have been invoked to account for
a host of factors known to affect both word recognition and \isi{production},
but which are not expressable within a maximally abstract generative
framework. Among these are the pervasive effects of word \isi{frequency}
(\citealt{Bybee2001}), the familiar-speaker effect in word priming,
as well as the persistence of \isi{sub-phonemic} detail (\citealt{tilsen2009subphonemic}),
and the influence of socio-indexical variables on what are typically
assumed to be more abstract, grammatical levels of processing (see
\citealt{docherty2014evaluation} for review). 

The term ``\isi{exemplar}'' is meant to indicate that representations being\largerpage
stored in memory are of individual, specific experiences. For example,
each time you hear the word \textit{lamb} over the course of your lifetime,
spoken by any of a number of different people, in any number of different
contexts, an \isi{exemplar} that resides within the category associated
with the word \textit{lamb} is created. Just as a minimal representational
framework implies the necessity of a \isi{normalization} procedure, a “maximal”
representational framework suggests that \isi{normalization} of the acoustic
signal may not be necessary at all. Since previous experiences of
the word \textit{lamb} share many similarities, among them that fact
that that there is some degree of \isi{nasalization} on the vowel, they
are likely to provide the closest matches to any new token that also
contains a nasalized vowel of this type. No reversal of \isi{nasalization}
is required (cf. \citealt{Johnson1997a}). Classification occurs by
discovering the cloud to which a new token bears the closest over-all
similarity in this space. However, because speech is so variable,
in ways that listeners seem quite sensitive to, this mental space
is a very high-dimensional one. As a result, the similarity computation
is likely to be quite complex. 

Because the relationship between the acoustic speech signal and the
structural units of language is a non-linear, many-to-many mapping,
there must always be a theoretical trade-off of this kind. For an
easy classification algorithm, generative theory requires complex
pre-processing in the form of a \isi{normalization} procedure. For little
to no pre-processing, \isi{exemplar} theory requires a complex classification
algorithm. In the modeling work that follows we will adopt the non-trivial
assumption that classification is perfect – that all tokens are recognized
as members of their intended category. The complexity, however, will
surface in the transformation between what is perceived (and subsequently
stored), and what is produced (based on what is stored). Nominally,
all the models in this work are \isi{exemplar} models. However, they are
really much more general-purpose models. In the limit, all tokens
can belong to a single category, or all categories contain a single
token each. The question of \isi{normalization} will remain central because
it depends on exactly how abstract the representations are, and there
will always be a trade-off between what is stored and what is computed.
