  journal = {Language and Speech},

  volume = {47},

  abstract = {This paper explores two related factors which influence variation
	in duration, prosodic structure and redundancy in spontaneous speech.
	We argue that the constraint of producing robust communication while
	efficiently expending articulatory effort leads to an inverse relationship
	between language redundancy and duration. The inverse relationship
	improves communication robustness by spreading information more evenly
	across the speech signal, yielding a smoother signal redundancy profile.We
	argue that prosodic prominence is a linguistic means of achieving
	smooth signal redundancy. Prosodic prominence increases syllable
	duration and coincides to a large extent with unpredictable sections
	of speech, and thus leads to a smoother signal redundancy.The results
	of linear regressions carried out between measures of redundancy,
	syllable duration and prosodic structure in a large corpus of spontaneous
	speech confirm: (1) an inverse relationship between language redundancy
	and duration, and (2) a strong relationship between prosodic prominence
	and duration.The fact that a large proportion of the variance predicted
	by language redundancy and prosodic prominence is nonunique suggests
	that, in English, prosodic prominence structure is the means with
	which constraints caused by a robust signal requirement are expressed
	in spontaneous speech.},

	The type studied here has the profile of regular sound change, but
	appears to be inhibited where homophony would result. The most widely
	cited cases of this phenomenon are reviewed and new cases presented.
	If sound change can be inhibited by impending homophony, how is this
	to be represented and understood? Here we offer a model of variation-based
	sound change where category evolution incorporates lexical competition.
	Lexical Character Displacement predicts accentuation of differences
	among similar words when syntagmatic disambiguation is limited. In
	the cases under discussion, this accentuation inhibits merger. However,
	as we show, the same principle can inhibit sound change altogether,
	or give rise to extreme phonological contrasts under similar conditions.},

Intrusive r always accompanied by r-vocalization/deletion, and linking r. Becomes schwa after high vowels! (making them non-high diphtongs). IN final position C-gesutre is reduced in magnitude and delayed = "vocalization"=separationg of V-gesture from C-gesture.
Provides experimental evidence for r-vocalization. If uncontraversially underlying r/l show same pattern observed in "intrusive" r/l then no additional explanatory appartus is needed; the intrusive r is there underlyingly. Production experiments with w, and l. initial and final allophones of r.},

Markedness reduction is taken to be the driving force in all cases, including the motivation for consonant epenthesis, and especially the selection of the epenthetic consonant, covered in Section 3.2 of the book. The strong claim is made that only certain segments are possible as "default" epenthetic segments, and only certain of these in onset position (nasals may only appear in coda position). An in-depth analysis of Mabalay Atayal and Axininca Campa are provided. In Secion 3.4 de Lacy argues that epenthesis in not the proper analysis for several other languages, providing the most in-depth analysis of Buriat.},

Morley argues that universalist claims about possible epenthetic segments are largely unfounded, and that this is due to the lack of a formal diagnostic for deciding whether alternation data constitute a process of epenthesis or a process of deletion. In particular she argues that there is little to no evidence in the sample for a coronal preference in consonant epenthesis. The forms used as evidence in each language are provided in an extensive appendix.},

  abstract  = {In this dissertation Paster proposes a classification of morphological alternations that belong to the set of Phonologically Conditioned Suppletive Allomoporphy (PCSA). Suppletive Allomorphy is characterized by multiple surface morphemes that cannot be acccounted for by a phonological process acting on a single underlying morpheme. Therefore, multiple underlying morphemes must be posited. The pattern can still be termed phonologically conditioned, however, if the distribution of the multiple allomorphs can be predicted by reference to phonological features -- regardless of whether they alternation is optimizing in the sense of producing less-marked structures. iMorphemes are specified underlyingly for the types of stem to which they attach, and phonological alternations apply locally at the edge of affixation, and involve underlying phonological features of the stem (that may not surface). Paster offers 137 examples taken from 67 languages that she analyzes as PCSA.},

Vaux takes hypercorrection, or rule inversion, to be the (main?only?) source of epenthesis patterns, thus providing an explanation for the fact that the segments that are inserted are often the same segments that delete.

In this account it is the difference in the relative openness of the oral cavity which leads to what he terms 'emergent' stops. Anticipation of an upcoming closure, or blockage of airflow, differing from that of the first consonant can result in both closures being active at the same time (both `valves' being closed). The cessation, or greater blockage, of air flow leads to a phonetic stop percept at the point of release of C1's closure. However, in the case of nasal+lateral sequences he attributes the emergent stop to anticipatory de-nasalization motivated by an effort to avoid assimilation of the lateral.},

In regular epenthesis, a syllable position, root node and default features are all added. In ghost segment epenthesis, the features are already present and only need to attach to the newly generated syllable and root node.},

Suffixes with ghost segments in initial position belong to the class of suffixes that impose skeletal templates on the roots to which they attach. But only the first two consonants and vowel of the root map directly to the template, the remaining properties of the word are explained by Yawelmani's right-to-left syllabification algorithm. Unsyllabified consonants trigger epenthesis, and `extra' consonants at the edge of the word simply syllabify. Ghost segments are defined as lacking a syllabic specification underlyingly: they cannot project a prosodic node. However, they are available to satisfy templatic slots when other consonants are not available. Thus, for example, in biconsonantal roots where a slot already exists for them to dock to ghost segments surface in coda position of the second required template syllable.},

She uses grammatical to refer to insertions conditioned by any of phonology, morphology, syntax, or some combination; phonetics includes articulation, acoustics, aerodynamics and perception; and prosodic refers to insertions that are restricted to specific prosodic boundaries or domains. She claims that coronal segments are the most likely in grammatical insertion, and coronals and glottals in prosodic insertion, but offers no explanation for why this should be the case.},

Johansson describes dialects in which the r sound only surfaces within words before vowels, and at the ends of words with inflectional or derivational endings beginning with vowels. Words like "stir" that surface with a final r in other dialects of English are analyzed as vowel-final in this dialect, such that a rule of insertion is required to account for the r that occurs between the end of the word and the beginning of the vowel-initial suffix. r also surfaces across word-boundaries in the same phonological environment, in what Johansson describes as the same "rhythmic group". A distinction is made between this scenario: "linking r", and instances of apparent innovation: "intrusive r", which occurs after specific vowels. The latter cases do not have a known historic source nor any counterpart in the spelling. Of these, the most common environment is after schwa across a word boundary in British Received Pronunciation (RP). An argument is put forward for treating the two phenomena as aspects of the same phonological rule. Various arguments are also presented for selecting an insertion rather than a deletion analysis for linking/intrusive r. 

Johansson describes the historic origins as a classic instance of rule inversion: historic deletion re-analzyed at some stage by speakers as insertion.  This rule inversion is described as a simplification of the synchronic system. He claims also that the re-analysis was facilitated by the phonetic similarity of r and schwa in EnglishHe assumes that historic r loss occurred in the first place due to the fact that preceding vowel assimilation made the final r redundant in terms of word dismabiguation.},

In RP j is described as surfacing after high front vowels, w after high back vowels, and r after non-high vowels. However, in WY it is necessary to describe the contexts as non-low front tense vowels for j; non-low tense back vowels for w, and non-high lax vowels for r. Broadbent uses this fact to argue for spreading of vocalic features into an empty onset position as the underlying process for all three cases.
