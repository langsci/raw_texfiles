\title{The expression of information structure in Cicopi}
\abstract{This chapter describes the information structure in Cicopi, discussing and illustrating the information-structural function of verbal inflection, word order, three types of cleft constructions, two types of predicate doubling, and the choice of referent expression. Cicopi has three different forms to mark the present tense: conjoint, disjoint/habitual, and progressive; and the perfective is marked by \nobreakdash-\textit{ile/\nobreakdash-ite} or \textit{to-.} The conditions under which these are used seems to depend not just on constituent-finality and aspect, but also on focus and maybe evidentiality. There is no dedicated focus position in Cicopi and the three clefts, as well as subject inversion, are used to express various types of focus.

\section{Introduction}

This chapter gives a general overview of the expression of information structure in Cicopi. Cicopi is a Bantu language codified as S61 in the \citet{Guthrie1948} classification, updated by \citet{Maho2009}, with ISO code [cce]. It is spoken predominantly in South Mozambique, in the provinces of Gaza and Inhambane, by approximately 336,020 people \citep{INE2017}. According to \citet{NgungaFaquir2011}, this language has 6 variants: Cindonje, Cilenge, Citonga, Cicopi, Cilambwe and Cikhambani. Cicopi was the variant used in this research because it is the reference variant \citep[see][]{NgungaFaquir2011}. Data were collected during the month of July 2019 in Chidenguele, Mozambique, with two male speakers and one female speaker aged 24--42, and were supplemented with data that were checked with these and other native speakers. The data were entered into an Online Language Database accessible via Dative, and transcribed according to the orthography \citep{NgungaFaquir2011}, with added tone marking and indication of vowel lengthening. We have done our best to mark surface tone, including downstep, but we are not certain of all tone marking (especially on the examples from the Frog Story), and further study is necessary to verify the tones and intonation and analyse the tone system.

Copi is a little-studied language. Among the studies carried out, the following stand out: \citet{DosSantos1941} with \citetitle{DosSantos1941}; \citet{Bailey1976} on the phonology and morphotonology; \citet{Nhantumbo2009} describing morpho-phonological processes resulting from marking the past in Copi; \citet{Nhantumbo2014} describing the verb in present and future; \citet{Nhantumbo2019} on the phonology and morphology of the verb; and \citet{Nhantumbo2019a} describing negation marking in Cicopi.

In this chapter, the aim is to provide an overview of how information structure in Cicopi is expressed. We do this by describing the context-dependent interpretation of a number of linguistic strategies in Cicopi, i.e. from form to function. We start with verbal inflection in Cicopi, to show the use and interpretation of different verb forms (\sectref{bkm:Ref141344108}), followed by the word order (\sectref{bkm:Ref141344123}), discussing the basic word order in Cicopi, the absence of a dedicated focus position in the sentence, and subject inversion constructions. We then continue to present the form and function of three types of cleft constructions (\sectref{bkm:Ref121993097}), and predicate doubling (\sectref{bkm:Ref141344221}). We close with remarks on referent expression (\sectref{bkm:Ref127267714}).

\section{Verbal inflection}
\label{bkm:Ref141344108}\label{bkm:Ref141358518}
Earlier work \citep{Bailey1976,Nhantumbo2014,Nhantumbo2019} primarily described the formal aspects (the morphology, tonology and morphophonology) of verbal inflection. In this section, we survey not just the form but investigate the use and meaning of the conjugations in more detail.

In some tense/aspect conjugations, Cicopi has more than one verb form. There are three forms in the present tense (\sectref{bkm:Ref141367382}), and two forms in the perfective (\sectref{bkm:Ref141367401}), whose distribution seems to be influenced or even determined by information structure (but see the discussion below for the influence of aspect and evidentiality, too, in the present tense). Their forms are given in \tabref{tab:key:1}. Two of the forms in the present tense resemble the so-called conjoint/disjoint alternation as found in other southern and eastern Bantu languages (see \citealt{vanderWalHyman2017} for an overview). This alternation is characterised by the two verb forms typically sharing the same tense/aspect semantics, but showing a difference in their distribution (conjoint cannot appear clause-finally whereas disjoint can) and a difference in information structure (the conjoint form being followed by focused information, and the disjoint not). The progressive form (which \citealt{Bailey1976} calls ``continuous") constitutes its own category, but interacts with the other two forms in applying to the present situation \citep{Nhantumbo2005}. The two perfective forms do not seem to vary in aspect. We discuss some information-structural differences below, but further research is needed to establish the exact form-meaning mappings.

We discuss the form, distribution, and interpretation of the present and perfective conjugations in turn.

\subsection{Present tense}
\label{bkm:Ref141367382}
The present tense conjoint and disjoint verb form in Cicopi belong to the same conjugation, as they share one negative form (see \tabref{tab:key:1}), and they can occur in question-answer pairs, with the question in \xref{bkm:Ref141369089} containing the unmarked conjoint present form, and the answer the disjoint form marked by \textit{a\nobreakdash-}.

The present tense forms differ in their distribution: As defining for the conjoint/disjoint alternation \citep{vanderWal2017}, the conjoint form cannot appear in sentence-final position of a main clause, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref120705766:a} and \xref{bkm:Ref120705751:b}. Instead, the disjoint form must be used, as in \xref{bkm:Ref120705766:b}, or the conjoint form must appear in non-final position as in \xref{bkm:Ref120705766:c}. The progressive can also appear in sentence-final position, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref120705751:a}.

Interestingly, the conjoint form is accepted in final position as a yes/no question, as in \xref{bkm:Ref120705945}. This is a use that has not been described in other languages, and at the moment it is not yet well understood.

There are indications in the penultimate lengthening that the conjoint and the progressive forms are phrased together with the following constituent(s). Based on analyses for other eastern and southern Bantu languages (e.g. \citealt{Zerbian2006} for Northern Sotho; \citealt{ZellerEtAl2017,Halpert2017} for Zulu; \citealt{Devos2008} for Makwe among others), we hypothesise that penultimate lengthening indicates the right boundary of a phonological phrase. The conjoint and progressive forms do not show lengthening on the verb (only on the object), whereas the disjoint form shows lengthening on both verb and object, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref120706029}. However, there seems to be variation, and dedicated investigation is needed to show the interaction between syntax, prosodic phrasing, and information structure.

When a postverbal element is in focus, the conjoint or progressive form has to be used; for example an inherently focused content question word \xref{bkm:Ref120706074} or an object modified by the exhaustive focus-sensitive particle ‘only’ \xref{bkm:Ref120706082}. The disjoint form is not accepted here (with or without penultimate length), as indicated for both examples.

Nevertheless, while focus occurs with a conjoint form, the inverse is not true: post-conjoint constituents can be unfocussable items such as parts of idioms, as in \xref{bkm:Ref120706130}, and cognate objects, as in \xref{bkm:Ref120706137}. Cognate objects and parts of idioms cannot be focused, because they cannot generate any alternatives in the idiomatic interpretation \citep[see][]{vanderWal2016,vanderWal2021a} – what else would one be dreaming if not a dream?

Thus, the conjoint form in Cicopi does not express (exclusive) focus on a postverbal element. This can also be seen in the possibility to modify an object by \textit{hambi} ‘even’ \xref{bkm:Ref120706251}, which is incompatible with an inherently exclusive meaning, as ‘even’ means that all other more likely items have also been washed, not excluding any alternatives.

The disjoint form has been called the habitual form \citep{Nhantumbo2005}, as it expresses actions that are regularly performed. The progressive form, on the other hand, refers to an ongoing action. The difference between these two verb forms in their aspectual interpretation is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref120706241}.

This does not mean that the disjoint form is obligatorily used for habituals, as can be seen in \xref{bkm:Ref127266023}, which uses the conjoint form in a habitual meaning/context, because the postverbal element is in focus.

As mentioned, the progressive is used for actions that are ongoing, as illustrated again in \xref{bkm:Ref127266052}, but the other two forms are acceptable as well for ongoing actions. The only difference indicated by our speakers was that \textit{osinya} (progressive) is used when you’re seeing it now, and \textit{yasinya} (disjoint) when you’re informing someone else.

Nevertheless, focus again trumps aspect, because if the postverbal object is focused, the conjoint form is preferred even if the action is carried out at the time of speaking, as in \xref{bkm:Ref127267122}.

While the exact difference in use and interpretation between the three present tense forms requires more in-depth investigation, the contexts sketched by the speakers for the disjoint and the progressive form indicate not just an aspectual difference but suggest a difference in evidentiality  too, as can be seen in the contexts for the two forms in \xxref{bkm:Ref127267131}{bkm:Ref127267133}. The disjoint form seems to indicate that the speaker had direct visual evidence; the evidential interpretation of the conjoint and progressive forms are not clear yet.\largerpage[2.25]

Further and more targeted research is required to establish the precise factors determining the use of each verb form in the present tense, but aspect (habitual vs. progressive), focus (postverbal or predicate-centred), and evidentiality all seem to play a role.

\subsection{Perfective}
\label{bkm:Ref141367401}
As mentioned, Cicopi has two forms in the perfective conjugation. The first is created with the suffix -\textit{ile/-ite} and the second with the prefix \textit{to}-. As shown in \tabref{tab:key:1} above, the two conjugations share the same negation, suggesting that their main difference is not in tense/aspect semantics.\footnote{We note, though, that both forms are accepted with inchoative verbs, but there seems to be a restriction on stative verbs, e.g. for \nobreakdash-\textit{ziva} ‘know’ the \textit{to}\nobreakdash- form is not accepted while the \nobreakdash-\textit{ile} form is. We thank a reviewer for asking about these predicates, but have to leave this for future research.} Both encode that the event has been finished \citep{Nhantumbo2009}. The suffixes \nobreakdash-\textit{ile} and \nobreakdash-\textit{ite} are not different morphemes, but allomorphs of the same morpheme. The allomorph \nobreakdash-\textit{ite} is used with stems ending in \nobreakdash-\textit{l} or \textit{\nobreakdash-t} \citep{Nhantumbo2014}, as in \xref{bkm:Ref136287899} and \xref{bkm:Ref136287901}, and with monoconsonantal verb stems (e.g. \nobreakdash-\textit{w}\nobreakdash- ‘fall’ and \nobreakdash-\textit{dy}\nobreakdash- ‘eat’). We refer to \citet{Nhantumbo2019} for further argumentation on the allomorphy.

We discuss the forms \textit{{}-ile/-ite} and the form \textit{to-} in this chapter, as we see some information-structural differences between them. The \textit{to}{}- form is felicitous in expressing state-of-affairs focus, i.e. supplying or contrasting the lexical value of the verb, as indicated in \xref{bkm:Ref127267278:a}, \xref{bkm:Ref127267346}, and \xref{bkm:Ref127267428}, but it is not felicitous in verum contexts, i.e. emphatic focus on the truth value, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref127267278:b} and \xref{bkm:Ref141371619:a}. The perfective shows the opposite behaviour and is felicitously used to express verum, as seen in \xref{bkm:Ref127267286} and \xref{bkm:Ref141371619:b}.\largerpage[2]

In summary, information structure influences the choice of verbal conjugations in Cicopi, at least in the perfective and the present, although the exact determining factors remain to be investigated.

\section{Word order}
\label{bkm:Ref141344123}
As a ``basic word order",\footnote{See \citet{KerrEtAl2023} for discussion on the extent to which grammatical roles like subject and object are useful in describing word order in Bantu languages.} Cicopi uses (S)VO order in the context of VP focus. When the subject is highly active, it is preferably expressed by just the subject marker;  a full NP subject is present when (re)activating the subject referent. This word order is illustrated in example \xref{bkm:Ref121988028} from the Frog story, where the boy is introduced in the first sentence, and the next line comments on this boy, adding the information that he has a frog and a dog.

In this section, we further discuss the information-structural functions found in the preverbal domain (Sections~\ref{bkm:Ref121988240} and~\ref{bkm:Ref124153637}), the lack of a dedicated focus position in the sentence (\sectref{bkm:Ref121988262}), subject inversion constructions and their interpretation (\sectref{bkm:Ref121988307}), and the right periphery (\sectref{bkm:Ref121988320}).


\subsection{No preverbal focus (?)}
\label{bkm:Ref120693404}\label{bkm:Ref121988240}
In terms of word order and the influence that information structure has on it, there seems to be a split topic-V-nontopic in Cicopi, but there is no dedicated focus position. Focused constituents occur in the postverbal domain (see Sections~\ref{bkm:Ref121988262} and~\ref{bkm:Ref121988307}) and, as is familiar from other Bantu languages (see for example \textcite{chapters/makhuwa}), focus is not allowed in the preverbal domain. This shown for question words in \xref{bkm:Ref121988341} and answers in \xref{bkm:Ref121988348}, both focused subjects.

Based on this generalisation, we would expect that a constituent modified by the exhaustive focus particle ‘only’ is also rejected. While it is true that preverbal non-subjects can never be modified by \textit{dwe} ‘only’ \xref{bkm:Ref141347018}, it does seem acceptable for preverbal subjects – compare \xxref{bkm:Ref141347018}{bkm:Ref141347020}, with the relevant constituent marked in boldface. Further research is needed here, as we also noted a preference in \xref{bkm:Ref124149613} for the exhaustive particle to apply to the predicate rather than to the subject.

Although active familiar topics are naturally expressed pronominally, for example by the object marker B's answer in \xref{bkm:Ref120091592}, topics may also be full NPs in the left periphery, as in \xref{bkm:Ref121987443}, where the action ‘to break a coconut’ is presented in the question, and occurs in the left periphery in the answer.

In combination with \textit{ni} ‘and’, it expresses that there is another referent apart from the topic referent for which the predicate also holds: \textit{ni yona} ‘and him/her too’, as in \xref{bkm:Ref121989699}. Both examples are from a recounting of the Frog story.

In shifting from one to the next event, Cicopi also uses tail-head linking, whereby an event mentioned in (the final part of) one sentence is repeated at the start of the next sentence. This is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref121989204} from the Frog story, where the action of scratching the nose is first repeated in the next sentence before moving the story forward.

There can also be multiple topics in the left periphery, be they arguments or scene-setting adverbs, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref122335950} and \xref{bkm:Ref146270227}. The object \textit{m’pawu} ‘cassava’ in \xref{bkm:Ref122335950} can be seen as a secondary topic here (as defined by \citealt{DalrympleNikolaeva2011}), meaning that “the utterance is construed to be about the relation that holds between it and the primary topic” \citep[2]{Nikolaeva2001}.

As subjects are typical topics, and canonically appear preverbally, it can be difficult to see in which (structural) position they are. The pronominal subject \textit{e:ne} ‘s/he’ in \xref{bkm:Ref141350066}, repeated from \xref{bkm:Ref127266023} above, is in a left-peripheral position, separated from the verb by the PP ‘by habit’.

However, the preverbal subject can also be an indefinite, as in \xref{bkm:Ref141350076}, which cannot be left-dislocated and hence provides evidence for a non-topical subject position as well. A systematic study of the prosodic properties of subjects (and other constituents) in the preverbal domain may well shine light on the syntactic status and marking of the different positions.

The left periphery also hosts scene-setting topics, such as the adverbial phrases \textit{ahá ká bhasíkêni} ‘at the bicycle’ in \xref{bkm:Ref121993048}, and in \xref{bkm:Ref121993050} the phrases \textit{ití ní wúsíkú dímwání dítshíkú} ‘one day at night’ and \textit{inkama angadipfuxela} ‘the time that he visited him’.

As further illustration of topics, the following example \xref{bkm:Ref146270541} shows a scene-setting topic (\textit{cibhabha ca mina} ‘to my left’), and in the reaction a contrastive topic (\textit{ani} ‘me’, as opposed to you), with the two contrastive topics indicated in boldface. The exchange also shows a contrastive focus with \textit{tihomu} ‘bulls’ being contrasted to \textit{timbwa} ‘dogs’, in italics in the example.

In summary, Cicopi does not seem to allow preverbal foci (but ‘only’ remains unclear) and prefers preverbal topics. There are multiple positions in the left periphery to which subjects and non-subjects can move, one of which is a non-topical subject position. In the next section, we turn our attention to the postverbal domain. 

\subsection{No dedicated focus position}
\label{bkm:Ref121988262}
As focused constituents cannot appear in the preverbal domain, they must appear postverbally, or in a cleft (see \sectref{bkm:Ref121993097}). This is again shown for the correction in \xref{bkm:Ref146270704}, where the focused object simply appears in a postverbal position.

While focus is restricted to the postverbal domain in a non-clefted sentence, there is no dedicated position for focus in Cicopi. Within the postverbal domain, there is no requirement for the focused element to appear adjacent to the verb (as in various other zone S languages, e.g. \citealt{Buell2009} for Zulu) nor phrase-finally (like in Kirundi, see \cite{chapters/kirundi}). We show this for the Theme and Recipient arguments in a ditransitive: either position can host a question word, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref121149061} and \xref{bkm:Ref121149063}, either can form the answer to a content question, as in \xref{bkm:Ref121149077} and \xref{bkm:Ref121149078}.

In the same way, phrases modified by the exhaustive focus particle \textit{dwe} ‘only’ can also appear in either position, as in \xref{bkm:Ref121149095} and \xref{bkm:Ref121149097}.\footnote{The logical possibilities are judged as follows, with bold indicating the focus (as diagnosed by contrast in a following clause):\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Theme} dwe Recipient &  Theme dwe \textbf{Recipient}\\
\textbf{\textsuperscript{\#}Theme} Recipient dwe & Theme \textbf{Recipient} dwe\\
Recipient \textbf{Theme} dwe & \textsuperscript{\#}Recipient Theme dwe\\

}
The prosodic break in \xref{bkm:Ref121149095:a} and \xref{bkm:Ref121149097:b} could be indicative of a requirement that the focus be final in some constituent, but further research into prosodic phrasing (and its relation with syntactic phrasing) is necessary to confirm this.

Note, however, that multiple focus seems to be possible only for question words and not for other focus constituents, as only one postverbal constituent can be modified by \textit{dwe} ‘only’, as seen in the ungrammaticality of example \xref{bkm:Ref124149352}.

Therefore, while focus appears in the postverbal domain in Cicopi, there is no dedicated focus position for objects or adverbs. We now turn to postverbal subjects, which work slightly differently.

\subsection{Subject inversion}
\label{bkm:Ref121988307}
The postverbal domain also hosts the logical subject in subject inversion constructions. These are constructions in which the logical subject appears postverbally and a possible topic appears in a preverbal position (see \citealt{MartenvanderWal2014} for an overview of subject inversion constructions in Bantu). Cicopi has two such constructions: Agreeing Inversion and Default Agreement Inversion (DAI), discussed in more detail below. Other possible inversion constructions are not accepted in Cicopi, such as Locative Inversion and Patient Inversion, in which respectively a locative or theme constituent appears preverbally and determines subject marking on the verb. Their unacceptability is shown in \xref{bkm:Ref141358804} for Locative Inversion,\footnote{Locative Inversion is unacceptable with or without applicative morphology} and in \xref{bkm:Ref141358815} for Patient Inversion.

In Agreeing Inversion, the subject marker on the verb agrees in noun class with the postverbal logical subject, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref120691553} where the postverbal \textit{mafaka} ‘maize’ determines the subject marker in noun class 6.

It is unclear at this point which form of the verb is acceptable in Agreeing Inversion (see \sectref{bkm:Ref141358518} on conjoint and disjoint verb forms), and which types of predicates can occur. Further research, for example on the scope of the postverbal subject relative to negation, is needed to establish the underlying structure of Agreeing Inversion in Cicopi, as well as its precise interpretation and use.

The second subject inversion construction, Default Agreement Inversion (DAI), is possible in Cicopi with unaccusative \xref{bkm:Ref127259247}, unergative \xref{bkm:Ref127259301}, passive, and transitive \xref{bkm:Ref127259279} predicates. The subject marker in this construction is insensitive to the person/number/gender features of the subject, remaining a default class 17, and the postverbal subject can be a question word or an answer, as illustrated in the following examples. The interpretation is discussed below.

DAI can have a thetic interpretation (“out of the blue”, see \citealt{chapters/intro} and \citealt{Sasse1996,Sasse2006}), or narrow subject focus. The thetic use is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref121990638} and \xref{bkm:Ref121990820} with an existential/presentational or announcing function.

With a transitive verb, narrow subject focus is the only interpretation that is allowed for DAI, regardless of the word order: both VOS and VSO are acceptable but only with subject focus, as indicated in the contexts for \xref{bkm:Ref136287722} and \xref{bkm:Ref121990860}; see also in \xref{bkm:Ref127259279:b} above.\footnote{Note, though, that there is a pause between O and S in the VOS order. As mentioned, more research is needed to understand the role of prosody.} This is in line with what \citet{CarstensMletshe2015} found for Xhosa VSO transitive expletive constructions.

All three present tense verb forms (see \sectref{bkm:Ref141358518}) are acceptable in DAI, with slight differences in meaning. The progressive form is used as a question or as a progressive action \xref{bkm:Ref136237672:a}, the disjoint form is used to express habitual action, as we can see in \xref{bkm:Ref136237672:b}, and the conjoint form for punctual action as in \xref{bkm:Ref136237672:c}. The precise conditions for the use of each form, and their interpretations in combination with subject inversion, remain to be investigated.

In summary, Cicopi accepts only two subject inversion constructions, Agreeing Inversion and Default Agreement Inversion. Not much can be said at this stage about the former, but the latter is possible with predicates of different valencies: with intransitives it is used in thetic environments as well as with focus on the postverbal logical subject, and with transitives the logical subject must be focused. The possibilities for conjoint and disjoint verb forms and their interpretations in subject inversion remain for further research. 

\subsection{Right periphery}
\label{bkm:Ref121988320}
It is not always clear whether the postverbal logical subject is part of an inversion construction or a right-dislocated constituent. Example \xref{bkm:Ref120095706} may look like an Agreeing Inversion construction, but the context indicates that the postverbal subject is not presented as new information (because it is given in the question) but should be analysed as a right-dislocated constituent. The same is true for \xref{bkm:Ref124151476}, from the Frog story, where the frog is part of the core of the story, but has not been mentioned for a while. The speaker, having referred to the frog first as ‘the animal he was looking for’ and then specifying in the right periphery as ‘his frog’.

A clear afterthought interpretation of a right-peripheral constituent is also seen in \xref{bkm:Ref121989942}: the narrator of the Frog story assumes that the hearer knows who\slash what was hitting the boy, but adds the information that this was the owl, in case it was not clear. Then, in the second part, \textit{mámé wúlé} ‘the boy’ is right-dislocated too, and also modified by a distal demonstrative.

Object marking seems to be optional for right-peripheral constituents, as shown in the comparison between \xref{bkm:Ref124152723:a} with object marker and \xref{bkm:Ref124152723:b} without. Note also the lengthening on \textit{hayi} ‘where’ in \xref{bkm:Ref124152723:a} but not \xref{bkm:Ref124152723:b}, likely indicative of the right edge of a prosodic phrase.

Object marking would be a potential further diagnostic to determine the status of constituents inside or outside the core clause, but object marking in Cicopi is still poorly understood (see \sectref{bkm:Ref127267714}).

To summarise this section on word order, the preverbal domain in Cicopi is restricted to non-focal constituents, and the postverbal domain contains non-topical constituents. Topics are preferably expressed in initial position, and focus constituents can appear in any postverbal position, although there may be a preference for the immediate-after-verb position. The right periphery contains backgrounded constituents such as afterthoughts. This is summarised in \figref{fig:cicopiwo}. 

\begin{figure}

\section{Cleft}
\label{bkm:Ref121993097}
Cleft constructions consist of a relative clause expressing the given/presupposed information, and a clefted focus constituent. Before we introduce the cleft constructions in Cicopi, we first provide information on the marking of cleft constructions, specifically the copulas and relative marking. The clefted constituent is marked by a preceding copula, and the copula can appear in three forms: segmentally as \textit{ngu} or \textit{i}, or suprasegmentally as a high tone. The copula \textit{ngu} is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref141428691}; the high tone copula can be seen in comparing \xxref{bkm:Ref141428713:a}{bkm:Ref141428713:b}. Example \xref{bkm:Ref141428713:a} is a cleft, with a high tone on \textit{mpú:nga} and compatible with modification by \textit{dwe} ‘only’ (see further below), whereas in \xref{bkm:Ref141428713:b} \textit{mpu:nga} `rice' is a low-toned left-dislocated topic, which hence cannot be modified by ‘only’. We gloss the high tone as \COP{}, together with the gloss of the first segmental morpheme.

As in many languages, cleft constructions in Cicopi are used to focus constituents, and Cicopi has three related constructions to do that: the basic cleft, the pseudocleft, and the reverse pseudocleft (which may be analysed better as a NP\,+ basic cleft). We discuss these in turn.

\subsection{Basic cleft}

The basic cleft in Cicopi is marked by a copula \textit{i} or \textit{ngu} preceding the clefted constituent, and a relative clause following it, as we can see in \xref{bkm:Ref120692880} above and \xref{bkm:Ref120693136}, where the relative is marked by the enclitic =\textit{ku}.

As already mentioned in \sectref{bkm:Ref120693404}, the question word by itself is ungrammatical in preverbal position, i.e. without the copula. Answers to content questions may also appear in a cleft, as shown in (\ref{bkm:Ref120693442}A2), although they do not need to, as shown in (\ref{bkm:Ref120693442}A1).

The focus on the clefted constituent comes out as exhaustive when the expression \textit{dwe} (only) is used. Note that \textit{dwe} can be separated from the clefted constituent but still modify it, as in the answer in \xref{bkm:Ref120693710}, where \textit{dwe} appears in final position, but is interpreted with the clefted subject \textit{Gomes}.

The exhaustive interpretation seems to be an implied part of the interpretation of the basic cleft, as visible in the answer to an incomplete question. The fact that the answer in \xref{bkm:Ref120694427} contains \textit{ihimhim} ‘no’, rather than \textit{iim} ‘yes’, shows that the cleft in the question can be interpreted as exhaustive: the cleft question in \xref{bkm:Ref120694427} asks, ‘Is [the sheep]\textsubscript{EXH} eating a carrot?’ and the negation applies to the exhaustivity: it is true that the sheep is eating the carrot, but it is not \textit{only} the sheep (also the tortoise). However, an answer with ‘yes’ was also given to a similarly ``incomplete" question, as in \xref{bkm:Ref120694485}, showing that exhaustivity is not inherent to the basic cleft.

The fact that inclusive \textit{hambi} ‘even’ is not acceptable in a cleft \xref{bkm:Ref120694799} illustrates the same point: if she has fed the goats even rice, as the least likely in a range of other foodstuffs that she also gave, then rice is not the exhaustive referent for which the predicate is true.

We have conflicting evidence for the universal quantifier \textit{sotshe} ‘all’. In principle, ‘all’ cannot exclude any alternatives and is therefore incompatible with exclusive focus. The unacceptability of \xref{bkm:Ref120694808} therefore suggests that the cleft has an exclusive interpretation; but the acceptability of \xref{bkm:Ref120694822} suggests differently. The explanation for this acceptability might be found in the context for examples like \xref{bkm:Ref120694845} and \xref{bkm:Ref120694861}: the universal quantifier is opposed to the alternative of ‘some’ (i.e. ‘not all’), thereby excluding at least that alternative. This opposition makes it compatible with an exclusive reading.

A ``mention some" question can also be used to test exhaustivity (see the BaSIS methodology, \citealt{vanderWal2021a}). Such a question has multiple good answers; for the question in \xref{bkm:Ref120694878} there are typically various places in which spring onions can be bought, and this means that the answer to such a question cannot contain an exhaustive focus strategy (as it would not be true that the mentioned place is the only place where onions can be bought). The question here can be felicitously answered by the SVO sentence in \xref{bkm:Ref120694878:b}, but for the cleft in \xref{bkm:Ref120694878:a} it was indicated that this means it would be the only place you can get them (which is not true and therefore infelicitous).

Given these data suggesting the exclusive or exhaustive interpretation of the basic cleft, it is surprising that the basic cleft is accepted with cognate objects \xref{bkm:Ref141364676} and parts of idioms \xref{bkm:Ref141364685}, retaining the idiomatic interpretation; as mentioned, cognate objects and parts of idioms are ``unfocusable" as they cannot generate any alternatives in the idiomatic interpretation \citep[see][]{vanderWal2016,vanderWal2022}. Note also that these are thetic contexts, which may be of influence on their unexpected acceptance.

Finally, as Cicopi does not have a restriction against multiple foci, the focus on a clefted constituent can be combined with focus elsewhere in the clause, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref120693735}. In \xref{bkm:Ref120693735:a} the exhaustive marker \textit{dwé} gives exhaustive focus to the object \textit{tikaneta} ‘pens’, which means that only pens were given to the children by the teacher, whereas in \xref{bkm:Ref120693735:b} the focus is on \textit{vanana} ‘children’, which means that only children were given pens (which presupposes that in addition to children other people such as school staff and others could have received the pens). \textit{Dwe} in these cases modifies the constituent immediately to its left.

In summary, the clefted constituent shows some properties of an exclusive or even exhaustive focus interpretation, but its use seems to be broader than that, given the felicity in thetic contexts with idioms and cognate objects.

\subsection{Pseudocleft}

In a pseudocleft, the copula joins a free relative and a noun phrase. So, we find first the relative clause (on its left), then the copula and a noun phrase or pronoun (on its right), as we can see in \xref{bkm:Ref120695311}.

The free relative clause in the pseudocleft is headed by the demonstrative pronoun. This proximate demonstrative pronoun is joined to the augment \textit{a\nobreakdash-} at the beginning to form \textit{awu} in \xref{bkm:Ref141365224} and \textit{aci} in \xref{bkm:Ref120696902}. The free relative clause describes an entity, and that entity is then identified by the focus (which is the referent of the NP or pronoun). To illustrate: the relative clause \textit{awu ningatimulosa} ‘the one I was greeting’ in \xref{bkm:Ref120695361} presupposes that there is someone greeting someone else, and the second part identifies exactly who was being greeted: \textit{Marta}. The context questions also indicate that the postcopular NP forms the focus, not the precopular part.\largerpage

The focus interpretation is also visible in \xref{bkm:Ref120696892}, where the pseudocleft structure results in ungrammaticality when applying the ‘even’ test which is marked by \textit{hambi} in Cicopi – this, in fact, suggests an exclusive reading. In \xref{bkm:Ref120696902}, the example also shows the unacceptability of parts of an idiomatic expression, in this case ‘the bucket’. Although the sentence is grammatical, it does not retain its idiomatic meaning, because alternatives are generated on the level of the object \{a stone, a ball, a bucket\} and not the whole idiom (pass away).

As in other languages, the pseudocleft in Cicopi is thus typically used for identifying a referent, although it remains to be seen if this is an exhaustive identification.

\subsection{Reverse pseudocleft\slash left-peripheral NP + cleft}

In principle, the two parts of the copular construction in a pseudocleft can be reversed, referred to as a reverse pseudocleft, e.g. ‘the men are the ones that have hats’. However, in this construction in Cicopi, the demonstrative in the relative clause is no longer marked with the augment, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref127264015}, where we see \textit{wu} rather than \textit{awu}. In fact, it can be an independent pronoun, as illustrated by \textit{yona} in \xref{bkm:Ref127264630}. We give two translations, foreshadowing the alternative analysis discussed later.

As in other Bantu languages (see \textcite{chapters/kirundi}, \textcite{chapters/rukiga}, \textcite{chapters/kinyakyusa}, \textcite{chapters/kiitharaka}), this apparent ``reverse pseudocleft" may be better analysed as a left-dislocated NP followed by a basic cleft. In this analysis, the clefted constituent is the demonstrative or personal pronoun, referring to the same referent as the initial NP. We suggest that the precopular NP functions as the topic – this would be compatible with the following prosodic break in \xref{bkm:Ref127264015} and \xref{bkm:Ref127264630} above. The clefted pronoun (\textit{wu}/\textit{yona}) then forms the focus.

This suggests that the referent to which the initial NP and the demonstrative refer must be topical information and be in focus at the same time. This is shown in \xref{bkm:Ref120697758}, where the girls are mentioned in the question and can hence be taken up as a (contrastive) topic, but since they are selected to the exclusion of the boys, they are in focus too. The topic function is expressed by the NP and the focus by the demonstrative in the cleft.

The fact that the initial NP cannot be a question word, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref120698646}, also suggests that this is not just a reverse pseudocleft. Nevertheless, the initial NP can be modified by \textit{dwe} ‘only’, as in \xref{bkm:Ref120698660}. Considering the pause after \textit{Tereza dwe} ‘only Teresa’, we propose that this can be analysed as a fragment answer, followed by a basic cleft, as indicated in the translations.

In summary, there is some evidence to show that what may at first sight look like a reverse pseudocleft, actually combines an initial NP, which functions as a topic or a fragment answer, with a basic cleft in which a demonstrative pronoun (coreferent with the NP) is in focus. This may be a strategy to express both the topical and the focal function of a referent, but divided the two over the NP and clefted pronoun.

\section{Predicate doubling}
\label{bkm:Ref141344221}
In a predicate doubling construction, the same predicate occurs twice: once in a finite and once in a non-finite form. Out of the three types of predicate doubling that \citet{GüldemannFiedler2022} describe, Cicopi has two predicate doubling constructions: topic doubling and in-situ doubling (discussed below). It does not allow cleft doubling, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref120698959}, where an infinitive forms the clefted constituent.

In topic doubling, the infinitive precedes the inflected form of the same verb, as in \xref{bkm:Ref121154546} for the verb \nobreakdash-\textit{bhika} ‘cook’.

Topic doubling typically implies a contrast with an alternative predicate (e.g. cooking versus eating), and this contrast can be made explicit, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref120700101}. Example \xref{bkm:Ref120700108} shows the same contrast with a transitive predicate, where both verb and object are preposed.

The object can also follow the inflected verb, but the interpretation will not be the same, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref120700122}. This example can be an answer to ‘what did you cook?’ (object focus) or to confirm that s/he really cooked as recommended. In contrast, when the whole verb phrase (infinitive plus object) precedes the inflected form, as in \xref{bkm:Ref141367009}, object focus is not a possible interpretation.

Topic doubling can in the right context also have a depreciative meaning, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref120700175} and \xref{bkm:Ref141429345}, or an intensive reading, as in \xref{bkm:Ref121149950}.

The second type of predicate doubling is called in-situ doubling. It features the infinitive in a postverbal position. The verb form of the inflected verb in the present tense can be each of the conjoint, disjoint, or progressive form (see \sectref{bkm:Ref141358518}), as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref120700227} – we do not know if this corresponds to a difference in meaning or use.

For in-situ doubling, there are two main interpretations. The first is an intensive reading, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref120700365} and \xref{bkm:Ref120700370}. Note that \xref{bkm:Ref120700365} also illustrates the possibility of a post-infinitival object in in-situ doubling.

The precise uses of topic doubling and in-situ doubling in Cicopi, as well as the possibilities with regard to the position of arguments (subject, object), and what these tell us about the underlying syntactic and semantic structure, remain for further research.

\section{Referent expression}
\label{bkm:Ref127267714}
Whether referents are more active or less active in the hearer’s (and speaker’s) mind has an influence on the way they are referred to \citep{Chafe1987}. Highly active referents need less material for successful reference \citep{Ariel1990,GundelEtAl1993}, and it is therefore unsurprising that in Cicopi such active referents can be referred to by a mere subject marker when they function as subjects, as illustrated earlier in this chapter and again in \xref{bkm:Ref124154447}, where we indicate a “null subject” by the empty set symbol.

The active object can equally be expressed pronominally, by object marking on the verb, as in \xref{bkm:Ref124152314} from the QUIS map task: speaker A activates the concept ‘butterfly’, and speaker B then refers to it by an object marker \textit{di\nobreakdash-}.

Out of context, it seems that the object marker can only function as a pronoun. Example \xref{bkm:Ref127267640:a} shows that the object marker on the verb and the coreferent NP cannot be in the same domain – the object marker is only allowed when the coreferent NP is extraposed, as in \xref{bkm:Ref127267640:b}. This was tested with question words, since we know for sure that those cannot be dislocated, and therefore the object-marked object preceding the question word (e.g. \textit{ndiyawe} ‘his sister’) must also be in situ in the same domain. The same is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref141373727}, where the object marker \textit{ma}\nobreakdash- cannot be present if the coreferent object \textit{mamanga} ‘mangos’ is in the same domain.

However, we do find examples of the cooccurrence of an object and an object marker, in contexts where the object referent is active. In examples \xref{bkm:Ref127267749} and \xref{bkm:Ref127267750}, the verb shows penultimate lengthening, so the object seems to be phrased separately from the verb, but there is no pause to indicate dislocation. We leave further analysis of Cicopi object marking for future research, but refer to \citegen{SikukuDiercks2021} findings for Lubukusu, where doubling is accepted in verum and mirative contexts when the object is given.\largerpage

We saw in Sections~\ref{bkm:Ref124153637} and~\ref{bkm:Ref121988320} that mentally active referents may be expressed by a noun phrase in the left or right periphery, and in this section we have seen that they may also be expressed by a subject or object marker on the verb, or (at least in the case of objects) be omitted completely. Further research is needed to establish what determines whether an object is expressed by an object marker or dropped altogether.

\section{Conclusion}

As we said in the introduction, the aim of this chapter is to give a general overview of the expression of information structure in Cicopi, and we have provided a first description and illustration of the information-structural functions of verbal inflection, word order, three types of clefts, predicate doubling, and referent expression. We can summarise the chapter as follows.

First, Cicopi has three forms in the present tense (conjoint, which is marked by zero morpheme; disjoint/habitual, marked by \textit{a-}; and progressive, marked by \textit{o-}). The precise conditions under which these are used require further investigation, but it seems to depend on a complex interaction between constituent-finality, focus, aspect, and perhaps evidentiality. The conjoint/disjoint alternation in any case seems to be determined more by constituency than by focus directly. In the perfective, there are two forms, \textit{{}-ile/-ite} and \textit{to}{}-. The \textit{to-} form is felicitous in expressing state-of-affairs focus (contrasting the lexical value of the verb), but is not felicitous in a verum context. The perfective \textit{{}-ile/-ite} shows the opposite behaviour and is felicitously used to express verum. The alternating verb forms in Cicopi are thus restricted by a less straightforward set of conditions than is known from other languages (see e.g. the parametric variation described by \citealt{vanderWal2017}); especially the potential link with evidentiality is remarkable.

Second, as in many other Bantu languages, the preverbal domain is restricted to non-focal constituents and prefers preverbal topics, and the postverbal domain contains non-topical and focal constituents. There may be an immediate-after-verb preference for focus, but Cicopi shows no restriction to a specific focus position, and focused constituents can appear in any postverbal position. Moreover, Cicopi allows multiple question words postverbally. The relatively complex set of factors determining the use of the conjoint and disjoint verb forms may have a correlation with the lack of a focus position in Cicopi: we can imagine that the (direct or indirect) relation between verb form and focus is not as clear as in a language with a fixed focus position (such as Zulu or Makhuwa, for example), and that therefore other factors (aspect, evidentiality) are more prominent than for other languages.

Third, the basic cleft shows some properties of an exclusive focus interpretation, but its uses seem to be broader, also being accepted in thetic environments, with cognate objects and parts of idioms. Pseudoclefts are also used to express focus, and what at first sight looks like a reverse pseudocleft was shown to be analysable as an initial NP functioning as a topic or a fragment answer, followed by a clefted (demonstrative) pronoun, similar to the construction in Kirundi, Rukiga, Kîîtharaka, and Kinyakyusa (see the other chapters in \citealt{langsci-current-book}). Further investigation is needed to establish the precise interpretations and the underlying structure of these cleft constructions.

Fourth, Cicopi has two predicate doubling constructions: topic doubling and in-situ doubling. The topic doubling shows an interpretation of verum and can also have a depreciative and intensive meaning (as also found in Kirundi, Rukiga, and Kîîtharaka), but further research is necessary to determine the precise uses of each predicate doubling construction, as well as the possibilities with regard to the position of arguments.

Finally, we have seen that active referents in Cicopi, in line with universal tendencies \citep{Gundel1988, GundelEtAl1993}, may be expressed by a noun phrase in the left or right periphery, particularly when indicating a shift topic, and may also be expressed just by a subject or object marker on the verb, or be omitted completely.

We hope that this chapter forms the beginning of many further discoveries about Cicopi and how it structures its information between speaker and addressee.

\section*{Abbreviations and symbols}

Numbers refer to noun classes unless followed by \SG{}/\PL{}, in which case the number (1 or 2) refers to first or second person. The orthography for Cicopi has been followed, including the following conventions: b [ɓ], bh [b], d [\textsf{ɗ}], dh [d], v [ʋ], vh [v], c [c], ch [c\textsuperscript{h}], j [ʒ], x [ʃ]. Tone marking indicates surface tone including intonation (to the best of our ability, and likely incorrect in places); high tones are marked by an acute accent; low tones remain unmarked, falling tones are marked by a circumflex accent. An apostrophe (as in \textit{m’fana}) indicates a syllabic nasal. Vowel length is indicated by /:/ and vowel nasalisation is indicated by m in the coda, as in \textit{ihimhim} [ihḭ:hḭ].
