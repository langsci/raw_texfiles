\title{The expression of information structure in Kirundi}
\abstract{This chapter reports on different linguistic means used in Kirundi to construct informational units in a sentence. We demonstrate that information structure has a fundamental influence on the morphosyntax of Kirundi. Information structure determines the word order to a large degree, with the requirements for topics in the preverbal domain and a final focus position leading to a range of subject inversion constructions. It can also influence the verbal inflection, particularly in verb forms distinguishing the conjoint/disjoint alternation. Other linguistic phenomena linked to information structure such as predicate doubling, the agreeing particle ~-\textit{ó} as a topic marker and copular constructions (clefts, pseudoclefts and reverse pseudoclefts) pinpointing the focus interpretation are also described in this chapter.}

\section{Introduction}
\begin{sloppypar}
Kirundi is a Bantu language spoken in Burundi in the Great Lakes region of central and eastern Africa. In \citegen{Guthrie1948} referential classification, updated by \citet{Maho2009}, Kirundi is JD62, and it has ISO code [run]. Its speakers are estimated to be over 11 million in Burundi, where it has the status of national and official language according to Article 5 of the National Constitution dated 7 June 2018. The country’s second official language is French. Kirundi is mutually intelligible with a number of neighbouring languages, most importantly Kinyarwanda (JD61), but also some languages spoken in the regions of Tanzania bordering Burundi, such as Kiha (JD66) spoken in Buha (south of Kirundi), Kihangaza (JD65) and Kishubi (JD64) in Bushubi (north-east). Kirundi is also close to Kivinza (JD67), spoken in Uvinza in Tanzania, south of Buha.
\end{sloppypar}

The current chapter mainly draws on \citet{Nshemezimana2016}, referring to other work on Kirundi where appropriate, and also drawing on the BantUgent monolingual corpus of Kirundi. Further data come from the first author as a native speaker, whose data for the BaSIS project have been stored in an Online Language Database via Dative, which is to be archived in The Language Archive. Examples created based on corpus examples are indicated as “derived”. 

While word order \citep{Morimoto1999,Morimoto2006,Bukuru2003}, the conjoint/disjoint alternation \citep{Ndayiragije1999,Sabimana1986,NshemezimanaBostoen2017}, and clefts \citep{LafkiouiEtAl2016} have been described and analysed before, the phenomena of predicate doubling and the marker -\textit{ó} are newly described here. We follow the Kirundi orthography \citep{Ntahokaja1994}. The tone marking in this chapter follows the Kirundi tradition started by \citet{Meeussen1959} and does not (necessarily) represent surface tones.

The aim of the chapter is to provide an overview of the different linguistic means that Kirundi uses to structure information in a sentence. Specifically, the conjoint/disjoint alternation is recapitulated in \sectref{bkm:Ref81485420}; we discuss word order, including the relatively large array of subject inversion constructions, in \sectref{bkm:Ref81485307}; predicate doubling is described in \sectref{bkm:Ref75783502}; \sectref{bkm:Ref72249299} describes the function of the marker -\textit{ó} as a contrastive topic marker; and \sectref{bkm:Ref72334782} discusses four types of copular constructions, including clefts and pseudoclefts. For further explanation on general terms in information structure we refer to \textcite{chapters/intro}.

\section{Conjoint and disjoint verb forms}
\label{bkm:Ref81485420}
Like many other eastern and southern Bantu languages, Kirundi has certain conjugations with two forms, the conjoint and the disjoint. These terms were coined for Kirundi by \citet[215--216]{Meeussen1959} to express the relation between the verb and the following element as together (French \textit{conjoint}) or separated (French \textit{disjoint}). The alternation has been linked to differences in information structure, with conjoint (\CJ{}) expressing focus on a constituent following the verb, and disjoint (\DJ{}) associated with predicate-centred focus (see \citealt{vanderWalHyman2017} for an overview). \citet{Nshemezimana2016} and \citet{NshemezimanaBostoen2017} provide a detailed corpus-based analysis of the alternation and its connection with information structure, which we summarise here, and add to.

Key to the conjoint/disjoint alternation is the fact that the conjoint verb form cannot appear clause-finally (i.e. some element has to follow), and there is a direct or indirect relation with information structure \citep[15]{vanderWal2017}. In Kirundi, the alternation is directly dependent on information structure, as \citet{Ndayiragije1999}, \citet{Bukuru2003}, and \citet{NshemezimanaBostoen2017} show, and as we also discuss below.

The alternation can be found in three conjugations in Kirundi: the present, near past, and remote past. We illustrate each below. In all tenses, the \CJ{} form is never constituent-final, and in the present and near past tense, it loses a lexical H tone if it has one. The \DJ{} form retains a possible lexical H, and is marked by a prefix -\textit{ra}- in the present and remote past, and by -\textit{a}- in the near past.

The fact that the \DJ{} form can be followed by a non-dislocated object or adjunct already shows that the alternation is not determined by constituency, as \citet{NshemezimanaBostoen2017} and \citet{Nshemezimana2016} also argue. 

\citet[397]{NshemezimanaBostoen2017} add that the potential and subsecutive conjugation also show the tonal effects with H-toned verbs, and show that the alternation is not present in negative and relative conjugations (in line with the tendencies in other languages, see \citealt{vanderWal2017}). They summarise the marking as in \tabref{tab:run-cjdjforms}.

\citeauthor{NshemezimanaBostoen2017} propose that the \DJ{} marker \textit{a}-/\textit{ra-} should be analysed as a marker of ``event focus" (predicate-centred focus), and moreover that the \CJ{} form is the default, without any focus function (cf. \citeauthor{Ndayiragije1999}'s \citeyear{Ndayiragije1999} analysis of \textit{a}-/\textit{ra}- as an antifocus marker). However, further details from introspective tests by Ernest Nshemezimana reveal that this cannot be the whole story. If the \CJ{} form is unmarked in form and function, the incompatibility with idioms and postverbal NPs modified by ‘even’ is unexpected. These instead require a \DJ{} form – with the \CJ{} form, the idiomatic reading is lost \xref{bkm:Ref75772351} or the sentence becomes ungrammatical \xref{bkm:Ref81548679}. In these sentences, the focus is clearly not on the event.

Furthermore, a cognate object is only accepted when modified to become specific \xref{bkm:Ref75772356}, and the same goes for the word \textit{umuntu} ‘person’ after a \CJ{} form: it either needs to be specified in order to be grammatical, or else it is interpreted as generic, as opposed to the corresponding \DJ{} form which freely accepts an indefinite reading. This too would be unexpected if the \CJ{} form were an information-structurally neutral form.

This suggests that there is more at hand than the \CJ{} form as a neutral form, specifically that some alternatives must be available (and possibly excluded) for the focused referent after a \CJ{} form. The exclusion of alternatives would explain the incompatibility of NPs with ‘even’, as these do not allow exclusion: with ‘even’,  the predicate is true for all alternatives, even the least likely one. A constituent modified by ‘even’ cannot follow the \CJ{} form if this requires exclusion of alternatives for the following constituent. The generic and the modified interpretation of the indefinite \textit{umuntu} ‘person’ also follows, as these are the two interpretations that allow for exclusion of alternatives: unlike the indefinite non-specific interpretation ‘someone’ (which does not exclude anyone), a person dressed like a fool excludes everyone not dressed as a fool, and ‘human being’ excludes the alternatives of cats, chickens, etc. For the same reason, exclusive focus on the element following the \CJ{} verb form also predicts incompatibility with the universal quantifier ‘all’. As shown in \xref{bkm:Ref76372322}, this is not directly ungrammatical in Kirundi, but the context shows that a contrast is interpreted with another set, thus allowing exclusion: all the sweet potatoes but not (all) the beans.\pagebreak

While these diagnostics thus suggest an interpretation of exclusive focus after the \CJ{} form, the following test shows that this cannot be \textit{exhaustive} focus. The theoretical difference is that for exclusivity at least \textit{some} alternatives must be excluded, while for exhaustivity \textit{all} alternatives are excluded. Correcting an incomplete assertion with a \CJ{} form cannot start with ‘no’, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref76372401}. This shows that the negation cannot apply to the hypothesised exhaustivity in the question: the negation can only apply to the truth of the statement, and since it is true that you drank milk (even though that is not the complete truth), this cannot be denied. From this answer, we deduce that there is no such exhaustivity present in the question, that is, the focus expressed by the \CJ{} form cannot be exhaustive, i.e. the question in \xref{bkm:Ref76372401} with the conjoint form is not interpreted as ‘Did you drink only milk?’. This differs from when the question contains an explicit exhaustive marker ‘only’ as in \xref{bkm:Ref76372415}, in which case ‘no’ in the answer denies the exhaustivity: it is not exhaustively milk that I drank.

An exclusive (even if not exhaustive) interpretation also predicts that the \CJ{} form will be incompatible with a context in which there are multiple correct answers. In such a ``mention some" context, either form is acceptable in Kirundi, but crucially, adding ‘for example’ throws off the \CJ{} form, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75856545}.

These data suggest an analysis in which the \CJ{} form triggers alternatives for the postverbal (clause-final, see \sectref{bkm:Ref81485890}) constituent. This analysis also explains the well-known restriction that postverbal question words, which are inherently focused, require the \CJ{} form \xref{bkm:Ref75857421}, as do contrasted NPs, and NPs modified by ‘only’ \xref{bkm:Ref75857415}.

We thus propose a characterisation of the \CJ{} form not as a default but as a form triggering alternatives for a postverbal constituent. This in turn suggests a characterisation of the \DJ{} form as triggering an alternative set NOT for a postverbal constituent. This negative characterisation is in line with its underspecified interpretation: the \DJ{} form is used for different types of predicate-centred focus \citep{Güldemann2010}, specifically TAM focus, verum, and state-of-affairs focus (see extensive argumentation in \citealt{NshemezimanaBostoen2017}). It is also used in thetic inversion constructions such as \xref{bkm:Ref76374640}, where the main motivation is the detopicalisation of the logical subject (see further \sectref{bkm:Ref75783474}). If any alternatives are generated, then they concern the whole assertion – \citegen{Lambrecht1994} ``sentence focus". Crucially, the \CJ{} form in subject inversion, if possible, expresses focus on the postverbal logical subject, as in \xref{bkm:Ref78543650}.

\citet{NshemezimanaBostoen2017} mention that there is one context in which the choice of verb form is ``up to the speaker" and no systematic difference in interpretation can be found. This is in environments for VP focus (Lambrecht’s predicate focus). Nevertheless, in specific examples we can detect a difference between VP focus with a \CJ{} or with a \DJ{} form. In \xref{bkm:Ref76375155}, the \CJ{} form suggests that washing dishes is what s/he did, possibly to the exclusion of doing other things, whereas the \DJ{} form has a more casual interpretation, suggesting other activities were also performed.

These new data thus help us to understand that the \CJ{} form is not the unmarked ``elsewhere" form that \citet{NshemezimanaBostoen2017} propose it to be, but triggers alternatives on the element following the \CJ{} verb form. This generalisation holds in those environments where the \DJ{} form is grammatically also possible, were it not for the context. This excludes relative and negative conjugations, for example, as these do not show an alternation but only allow one form (formally equal to the \CJ{} form). In line with \citet{NshemezimanaBostoen2017}, we conclude that the \CJ{}/\DJ{} alternation in Kirundi is directly affected by information structure, unlike in neighbouring Kinyarwanda, which \citet{NgobokaZeller2017} analyse as constituent-based.

\section{Word order}
\label{bkm:Ref81485307}
Word order in Kirundi is largely determined by information structure. The preverbal domain is restricted to non-focal elements and highly preferred for topical elements, whereas the postverbal domain is characterised as non-topical, with the clause-final position reserved for focus. Example \xref{bkm:Ref74312415} illustrates that it is the clause-final constituent that is in focus.\largerpage[2]

We discuss the interpretational restrictions and preferences for the preverbal and postverbal domain subsequently, paying special attention to sentence-final focus (\sectref{bkm:Ref81485890}) and subject inversion constructions (\sectref{bkm:Ref75783474}).

\subsection{Preverbal domain}

As in other Bantu languages (see \citealt{Zerbian2006a,Yoneda2011,vanderWal2009} among others), in Kirundi there is a ban on focus in a preverbal position, as shown for content question words in \xref{bkm:Ref72332402:a} and \xref{bkm:Ref105321835:a} and elements modified by ‘only’ in \xref{bkm:Ref105321684:a} and \xref{bkm:Ref142557423:a}.\footnote{Content questions and their answers are inherently focused, and the particle ‘only’ is an exhaustive focus-sensitive particle, which therefore modifies a focused element. As described in \textcite{chapters/intro}, these are used as diagnostics for focus.} Instead, the focused element occurs postverbally, or in a cleft construction. The postverbal focus is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref105321835:b} and \xref{bkm:Ref142557423:b} for objects, and in the subject inversion construction in \xref{bkm:Ref72332402:c} and \xref{bkm:Ref105321835} (see further in \sectref{bkm:Ref72335068} on subject inversion). Example \xref{bkm:Ref72332402:b} illustrates a clefted subject (see \sectref{bkm:Ref72334782} on clefts). We do not illustrate all the possible grammatical versions but refer to the relevant sections – for now, the take-away point is that focus may not occur preverbally.

The preference for topics to occur preverbally can be seen in left-dislocated arguments, such as \textit{abaana} ‘the children’ in \xref{bkm:Ref73810020} and frame-setting elements like \textit{harya} ‘there’ in \xref{bkm:Ref73810045}, both given in the context.

It is also possible for multiple topic expressions to occur preverbally, either specifying ever smaller subsets, for example of location in \xref{bkm:Ref74316186}, or narrowing down the referent by intersection of time and place, as in \xref{bkm:Ref74318587}.

Multiple active participants may also be expressed as preverbal full NPs or pronouns, illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref142552207}. Note that when both topical referents are expressed pronominally, the first referent can be analysed as an aboutness topic (indicating to the addressee which referent the following information is about), and the second is interpreted as a contrastive topic (i.e. an identifiable typically given referent that is contrasted with another given referent), as shown in \xxref{bkm:Ref142552207:b}{bkm:Ref142552207:c}.

However, it is also possible for non-topical subjects to occur preverbally, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref75348847} and \xref{bkm:Ref75339354}. These examples show that indefinite non-specific subjects, which cannot function as topics, can occupy a preverbal position.

In summary, the preverbal domain may not be occupied by focused constituents, and is preferred for topics, which may be contrastive. Nevertheless, the preverbal domain cannot be characterised as only topical, since indefinite non-specific subjects may also appear preverbally. 

\subsection{Postverbal domain}
\label{bkm:Ref72335068}
The verb phrase typically functions as the comment to the preverbal topic. The whole VP can form the focus, as in the storyline in \xref{bkm:Ref142555660} or with the cognate object in \xref{bkm:Ref142555662}, or the focus can be only one constituent within the comment, which appears in clause-final position (on which more in \sectref{bkm:Ref81485890}).

Material that is neither topical nor focal can also appear in the postverbal domain. This is typically the case for subject inversion constructions, discussed and further illustrated in \sectref{bkm:Ref75783474}. The postverbal domain thus hosts non-topical information, and this may be focal, but only in clause-final position, as shown in the next section.

\subsubsection{Sentence-final focus}
\label{bkm:Ref81485890}
Focused elements appear in sentence-final position or in a cleft construction. The clefts are presented in \sectref{bkm:Ref72334782}, and here we discuss the clause-final focus position. This position, as identified by \citet{Sabimana1986} and \citet{Ndayiragije1999}, is shown for Theme and Recipient arguments of ditransitive verbs in the following examples: content questions in \xref{bkm:Ref72332331} and \xref{bkm:Ref79838134}, answers to those questions in \xref{bkm:Ref72332345} and \xref{bkm:Ref72332347}, and arguments modified by the exhaustive focus-sensitive particle ‘only’ in \xref{bkm:Ref72332358} and \xref{bkm:Ref72332359}. In each example we see that the focused element (the question word, answer, or constituent modified by ‘only’) must appear as the second of the two objects, in the clause-final focus position.

Kirundi thus shows evidence for a dedicated clause-final focus position.

\subsubsection{Subject inversion constructions}
\label{bkm:Ref75783474}
In keeping with the tendency for preverbal elements to be topical and focal elements to be postverbal, the logical subject \textit{must} stay in a postverbal position when it is focal and \textit{prefers} a postverbal position when it is non-topical (alternatives being the various clefts described in \sectref{bkm:Ref72334782}). Such word orders are known as subject inversion constructions \citep{Zerbian2006a}. Kirundi is exceptional in showing all seven types of subject inversion constructions listed by \citet{MartenvanderWal2014}, including Patient Inversion, Semantic and Formal Locative Inversion, Instrument Inversion, Complement Inversion, Default Agreement Inversion and Agreeing Inversion. These are discussed extensively by \citet{Nshemezimana2016,Ndayiragije1999,Morimoto2000,Morimoto2006,Morimoto2009} and \citet{Sabimana1986}, and are presented in turn below.

In Patient Inversion, the patient occupies a preverbal position, determining subject agreement on the verb, and the logical subject is clause-final. In \xref{bkm:Ref141643390}, for example, the theme \textit{amaazi} ‘water’ is preverbal, determining subject marking in class 6, and the logical subject ‘Yohana’ appears postverbally. The postverbal logical subject is interpreted as focused in Patient Inversion, as shown by the compatibility with \textit{gusa} ‘only’ in \xref{bkm:Ref73976448}, and the simple focus in answer to a content question in \xref{bkm:Ref75346778}. Patient Inversion takes the conjoint verb form, and cannot be used in thetic contexts. For pragmatic restrictions on animacy in Patient Inversion, see discussion in \citet{Morimoto2006} and \citet{Nshemezimana2016}.

In Formal Locative Inversion, a topical locative expression appears preverbally, subject marking is always class 16 \textit{ha}-, and the logical subject appears in final position forming the focus, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref73976458}. The subject marker \textit{ha}- is formally the same as the expletive (see Default Agreement Inversion), but a difference is spotted in the fact that it can still refer to a location, as in \xref{bkm:Ref81464317}. Locative Inversion, too, is not found in thetic contexts but only with subject focus.

Apart from the locative class 16 subject marking, the verb in Locative Inversion can also have an enclitic in -\textit{o}, coreferent with one of the four locative classes: =\textit{hó} (cl.16), =\textit{mwó} (cl.18), =\textit{kó} (cl.17) and =\textit{yó} (cl.19) \citep[64]{Meeussen1959}. See also \citet{DevosEtAl2017} on Kirundi locative enclitics. The class 18 =\textit{mwó} is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref79856645}.

The enclitic is used when the locative noun phrase is dislocated, suggesting that the enclitic is a (resumptive) pronoun. This renders the locative phrase free in its position, being able to appear in initial \xref{bkm:Ref105422954:a}, central \xref{bkm:Ref105422954:b}, or final position \xref{bkm:Ref105422954:c}.\pagebreak

While \textit{ha}- is underspecified for locative semantics, the enclitic agrees in class with the dislocated locative noun phrase and specifies the exact location: among (with =\textit{mwó}) \xref{bkm:Ref80456712}, on (with =\textit{kó}) \xref{bkm:Ref80456733}, inside (with =\textit{yó}) \xref{bkm:Ref80456754},\footnote{Note that class 16 =\textit{ho} and 19 =\textit{yo} (but not 17 and 18) can be used to refer to locative noun phrases of class 18.} or with existential reference (=\textit{hó}) \xref{bkm:Ref80456783}.\footnote{It is interesting to note that the corpus study by \citet{NshemezimanaMberamihigo2021} reveals that the majority of locative enclitics is the class 18 =\textit{mwó}, with 95.74\% in the written part of the corpus, and 66.15\% in the oral part. This can perhaps be linked to its larger variation in use, alternating with =\textit{yo} in certain contexts, as in \xref{ex:kirundi:whatinhere}.

The enclitic can also be used for disambiguation: without the locative enclitic, \xref{bkm:Ref80278403} is ambiguous between a goal reading of the locative phrase (‘going to Bujumbura’) and a source reading (‘leaving from Bujumbura’).

Kirundi also features Semantic Locative Inversion (SLI). SLI received its name from the fact that the locative interpretation of the preverbal constituent is only present semantically in denoting a spatial or temporal localisation \citep{Buell2007}. This differs from the formally locative phrase that is crucially marked by the locative prefix (see above). In SLI, the verb takes its subject marker in the noun class of the preverbal (semantically but not formally) locative phrase in the subject function, as seen in \xref{bkm:Ref149303804} for the class 8 location `these eyebrows'; in Formal Locative Inversion the subject marker is in locative class 16.\largerpage[2]

In Instrument Inversion, intransitive as well as transitive predicates may occur, but the instrument must crucially be an argument of the verb. This is done by deriving the verb as a causative, marked by the suffix -\textit{ish}/-\textit{esh}, as illustrated in \xref{ex:implements} and \xref{ex:drinkstraw:c}, the alternative being the instrument in the function of an adjunct, as in \xref{ex:drinkstraw:a} and \xref{ex:drinkstraw:d} with the preposition \textit{na} ‘with’. In \xref{ex:implements}, the instrument \textit{ivyo bikoreesho} ‘these implements’ precedes the verb and determines subject marking in class 8, and the logical subject ‘Christians and non-Christians’ follows the verb. As \citet{Zeller2013} also notes for Zulu, the predicate must prototypically take an instrument for inversion to be possible (e.g. write with a pen, but not climb with a ladder), for example in \xref{ex:drinkstraw} drinking with a straw. The straw (\textit{umukeenke}) is an adjunct in \xref{ex:drinkstraw:a}, it is a postverbal argument in \xref{ex:drinkstraw:b} where the verb is not -\textit{nyw}- but the causative -\textit{nyweesh}-, and it appears preverbally in the subject inversion construction in \xref{ex:drinkstraw:c}, determining subject marking on the verb in class 3. In all instances of Instrument Inversion, the postverbal logical subject is in focus, and again the construction cannot be used in a thetic context.

Complement Inversion involves a CP triggering subject marking in (default) class 8 on the verb, and the postverbal subject is in focus. Unlike in Kinyarwanda \citep[193]{Kimenyi1980}, the CP does not appear in preverbal position in Kirundi, but is typically right-dislocated (presumably because it is phonologically heavy), as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref75348528:a}.

In Default Agreement Inversion (DAI), the subject marker is the expletive \textit{ha}-, which here does not refer to a particular place (compare to Locative Inversion above). When the verb takes a conjoint form (see \sectref{bkm:Ref81485420}), the clause-final logical subject is interpreted as focus, seen in the question word in \xref{bkm:Ref73976476}, and the subject modified by ‘only’ in \xref{bkm:Ref75346884}, as well as the incompatibility with ‘even’ \xref{bkm:Ref105424268}; the latter test suggests an exclusive focus interpretation.

When the verb takes its disjoint form, the entire sentence is within the scope of the assertion – unlike the conjoint form, it does not imply any presupposition. These are known as ``thetic sentences", and these can be seen as sentences without a topic expression, i.e. in which the subject is detopicalised  \citep{LambrechtPolinsky1997,Lambrecht2000,Sasse1987}. As expected, it is ungrammatical to modify the postverbal constituent with \textit{gusa} ‘only’, as in \xref{bkm:Ref79131990}. This DAI construction can be compared to the presentational construction with \textit{hari/hariho} (see \sectref{bkm:Ref75348623}), which differs in both form and function.

Transitive predicates may also participate in DAI, whereby both the agent and the patient argument appear postverbally. The only possible interpretation is subject focus (in line with \citet{CarstensMletshe2015}'s observation for Xhosa), and the subject must, as expected, occur in clause-final position, resulting in VOS order \xref{bkm:Ref75339373}. Here, only the conjoint form is accepted, and a thetic interpretation is impossible.

In Agreeing Inversion, the subject marker agrees with the postverbal logical subject. Here, the logical subject has to be indefinite and only the disjoint verb form may be used. In this construction, the postverbal logical subject is part of the new information (though not focal), and the construction as such is used in a thetic environment, as in \xref{bkm:Ref73950839} and \xref{bkm:Ref79132665}. The DAI and presentational alternatives (see further in \sectref{bkm:Ref75348623}) are also felicitous here as indicated in \xref{bkm:Ref116983035} and \xref{bkm:Ref116983036}, respectively; DAI is seen as very natural, and AI is associated with colloquial use.

VS word order is not only encountered in subject inversion, but also when the subject is right-dislocated. However, we can see a clear difference between AI on the one hand, and a right-dislocated subject on the other hand. In AI, the subject is part of the new information; it is in a low syntactic position, scoping under negation, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75349904}; and there is no prosodic break between V and S.

In summary, the logical subject appears postverbally in subject inversion constructions, where it is interpreted as focused when the verb is in its conjoint form, and as non-topical in thetics with a disjoint form. When compared to other Bantu languages, Kirundi is exceptional in allowing a wide range of inversion constructions, as also discussed in \citet{KerrEtAl2023}.

\section{Predicate doubling}
\label{bkm:Ref75783502}
It is possible in Kirundi to use the infinitive together with an inflected form of the same predicate, a construction known as ``predicate doubling" (see overview in \citealt{GüldemannFiedler2022}). Of the three types of predicate doubling, Kirundi allows topic doubling, and shows a special nominalised in-situ doubling. We discuss these in turn.

In Topic doubling, the infinitive occurs in the left periphery as a topic. For intransitive verbs, there are four possible interpretations. The interpretation can be a) verum as in \xref{bkm:Ref72248348}, b) implied contrast with another action/verb as in \xref{bkm:Ref72248357}, c) depreciative \citep[cf.~][]{Meeussen1967}, d) intensive/excessive; both c and d are illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref72248384}.

For topic doubling with a transitive verb, the object can either follow the infinitive, or the inflected verb. If the object follows the infinitive, as in \xref{bkm:Ref80458229}, the focus is on the VP and the interpretation is verum or depreciative; if the object follows the inflected verb, as in \xref{bkm:Ref78492154}, the focus is on the object, as indicated in the context of an object question.

Since topicalised constituents can be marked by the contrastive topic marker -\textit{ó} (see \sectref{bkm:Ref72249299}), the initial infinitival phrase can be marked as such, too, by \textit{kó}.

A second type of predicate doubling, cleft doubling, is not acceptable in Kirundi with the same predicate appearing twice. If the infinitive is clefted, the predicate cannot be doubled (as is possible in other languages, such as Fwe \citep{Gunnink2018} and Kîîtharaka \citep{chapters/kiitharaka}), but instead the light verb -\textit{kora} ‘do, make’ must be used, as in \xref{bkm:Ref116983834:b}.

Equally ungrammatical is the third type of predicate doubling: in-situ doubling with a bare infinitive is not accepted (which is possible in other languages, e.g. Kîîtharaka and Kinyakyusa – see \textcite{chapters/kiitharaka} and \textcite{chapters/kinyakyusa}):

However, two other nomino-verbal forms can be used in situ with the same inflected predicate: either a derivation in class 14 \textit{bu-} with a final vowel -\textit{e} (equal to the subjunctive), as in \xref{bkm:Ref78492908} and \xref{bkm:Ref78492919}, or with \textit{nya} preceding the infinitive, as in \xref{bkm:Ref78492942}.

Both constructions with \textit{bu}- and \textit{nya} bring about a reading of ‘really’, ‘properly’, referring to a prototype (as in the English reduplication ‘I want a DRINK-drink’, see \citealt{GhomeshiEtAl2004}), but also touching on verum and unexpectedness. The precise interpretations and use of this and the other predicate doubling constructions remain for future investigations.

\section{Particle -ó for contrastive given information}
\label{bkm:Ref72249299}
Kirundi has a particle -\textit{ó} that originates as a pronoun (the ``-o of reference" in \citealt{Ashton1945}) but also functions as a marker of contrastive given information. This is also found in Kîîtharaka and Rukiga with similar functions (see \citealt{AsiimwevanderWal2021}, \textcite{chapters/rukiga} and \textcite{chapters/kiitharaka}). In its function as a pronoun, we encounter -\textit{ó} as an independent pronoun – in \xref{bkm:Ref75439017} the pronominal object, after the preposition \textit{na} ‘with’ in \xref{bkm:Ref74930335}, and after the comparative \textit{nka} ‘like’ in \xref{bkm:Ref74930344} – and also as an enclitic when referring to locations \xref{bkm:Ref75359891}.

However, -\textit{ó} can also be used in a different way, to mark given information as contrastive. This is shown in the contrast between \xref{bkm:Ref74930350:a} and \xref{bkm:Ref74930350:b}, and discussed in more detail below.

As a contrastive topic marker, the particle typically follows the topical, left-peripheral noun, as in \xref{bkm:Ref74757572}. It cannot precede the noun it refers to, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref74757617}, but the particle can appear initially as in \xref{bkm:Ref74757916}, or finally as in \xref{bkm:Ref74757932}, when referring to a pronominal referent that is indexed on the verb – in this case the subject marker in class 2.

The same holds for objects that are pronominally represented by an object marker: the coreferring left- or right-dislocated phrase can be marked by -\textit{o}, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref74758345}. Note that the object marker must be present here.

Having seen the formal properties of the pronoun/particle, we can discuss its use and interpretation in more detail.

\subsection{Functional properties of -\textit{o}}

The presence of the particle adds a contrastive meaning, that is, the referent is contrasted with another referent. However, it can only be used with given referents, not with newly presented, focal referents. This is shown in the incompatibility of the particle with a noun in a basic cleft or pseudocleft (both constructions expressing focus, see \sectref{bkm:Ref72334782}), shown in \xref{bkm:Ref75175945} and \xref{bkm:Ref75175946}, respectively.\pagebreak

It is telling that instead of the ungrammatical \xref{bkm:Ref75175946} with the particle, the sentence in \xref{bkm:Ref75176045} comes more naturally. Here, the particle modifies the initial free relative \textit{abaáje} ‘the ones who have come’, which is given information, as indicated in the context, and functions as the topic.

In the same way, the postverbal logical subject cannot be modified by -\textit{ó}, as shown for Locative Inversion in \xref{bkm:Ref75179471}. This is expected, as the postverbal logical subject is the focus (see \sectref{bkm:Ref75783474}). Equally expected is the fact that the preverbal locative \textit{can} be modified by -\textit{ó}, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75179462}, since this has been shown to function as the topic \citep[62]{Nshemezimana2020}.

Finally, -\textit{ó} cannot modify the object when the object is in focus following a conjoint form, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75180460}, or even when it is included in VP focus following a disjoint form, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75180621}. The particle can only be added when the object is dislocated, as seen by the presence of the object marker on the verb \xref{bkm:Ref75180614}.

While the particle is syntactically optional in \xref{bkm:Ref75180614}, the contexts for felicitous use with and without the particle are crucially different: without -\textit{ó} , \xref{bkm:Ref75180614} is an answer to ‘What have you done with the banana?’ (focus just on the verb, the object being given information), while the presence of -\textit{ó} requires that some alternative edible referent has been mentioned before, as in ‘So if you haven’t eaten the avocado, then what about the banana?’. This again shows the contrastive interpretation associated with the particle -\textit{ó}.

As -\textit{ó} can only combine with dislocated NPs, and these necessarily represent given information, the only interpretation that \textit{umuntu} ‘person, someone, human being’ can receive in \xref{bkm:Ref75182159} is generic. Furthermore, this allows for alternatives and hence contrast with other living beings.

When a contrast is made between two active referents, it is infelicitous to mark the first referent by -\textit{ó}, but it is preferred for the second referent to have the particle, either by itself or with \textit{na}-, both illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref81509490}.

As the particle associates with topics, it can be added to the predicate doubling construction discussed in \sectref{bkm:Ref75783502}. When present, it can highlight the concessive aspect of meaning, or give a mirative or exclamative flavour, as the underspecification of interpretations in \xref{bkm:Ref75263857} and \xref{bkm:Ref75264568} shows.

The same mirative/exclamative flavour can be present when -\textit{ó} is used with a (non-infinitival) NP, as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref75263788} and \xref{bkm:Ref75263790}. The contrastive or exclamative interpretation is dependent on the context. Here, prosody/intonation plays an important role in removing ambiguity. For example, in the exclamative context, the construction has an exclamatory intonational reading, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75263788}, while in a contrastive context, we have two intonational contours, one ascending and the other descending which respectively affect the first part and the second part of the sentence, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75263790}.

To summarise, -\textit{ó} originates as a pronoun and still functions as such, but has further developed as a marker to indicate contrast on given (topical) referents. A next step in the research on this particle should include the interaction of the particle with specific contexts to specify in detail the possibilities for mirative and exclamative interpretations.

\section{Copular constructions}
\label{bkm:Ref72334782}
There are four constructions in Kirundi that involve a copula and some form or relative clause: 1) the presentational, introduced by \textit{hari(ho)}; 2) the basic cleft; 3) the pseudocleft; and 4) the reverse pseudocleft\slash left\hyp peripheral NP + cleft. These constructions can be distinguished not only by their syntactic configuration but also their information structure. We discuss these in turn, after we present general information on the copula and verb ‘to be’, which are relevant to all four constructions. Throughout this section, we build on \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016}, who provide an in-depth discussion of these constructions on the basis of corpus data. We add to their analysis by providing further tests for the exact interpretation of each of the constructions.

\subsection{Copular verbs}

There are four markers involved in nominal predication: invariant \textit{ni}/\textit{si}, inflected verbs -\textit{ri} and \textit{ba}-, and negative presentational marker \textit{ntaa}. We also refer to \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016} for discussion of copulas in Kirundi.

The invariant copula used in each of the constructions mentioned is used to create a nominal predicate. As such, it does not accept valency-changing or other derivational morphology, and cannot inflect for tense, aspect, mood, and person. The only variation is the affirmative \textit{ni} vs. negative \textit{si}. We show its use in a predicational copular clause in \xref{bkm:Ref73705366}, and in a cleft in \xref{bkm:Ref75358266} and \xref{bkm:Ref74741046}.

The invariant copula \textit{ni/si} is only used to express the present tense – when tense or aspect other than the general present needs to be indicated, the copular verb -\textit{ri} is used, a reflex of Proto-Bantu *\textit{d\`{ɪ}}. This verb is not restricted in inflection, taking prefixes for tense and a subject marker, as shown for a simple predicative clause in \xref{bkm:Ref75184052}, for a cleft in \xref{bkm:Ref73960454}, and for a presentational construction in \xref{bkm:Ref75184028}.

The verb -\textit{ri} can and must also be used in a subordinate clause, in the past as in \xref{bkm:Ref75355595}, but strikingly also in the present tense, with an impersonal subject marker \textit{a}- as in \xref{bkm:Ref73716709}, called an expletive marker by \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016}. The invariant copula \textit{ni/si} is unacceptable, shown in \xref{bkm:Ref73716671}, and so is normal subject inflection, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75247211}.

There is a third verb of existence, which is used in presentationals. This is -\textit{bá}, which can be translated as ‘be, exist’ in predicational constructions \xref{bkm:Ref75356327}, or as ‘live’ \xref{bkm:Ref75356329}.

The two forms -\textit{bá} and -\textit{ri} are in complementary distribution, even in the presentational construction. For example, -\textit{ri} cannot be used in future tense \xref{bkm:Ref75258689} or perfective aspect \xref{bkm:Ref75258679}, where instead -\textit{bá} needs to be used.

A question that is relevant for basic clefts is whether the invariant copula \textit{ni} has further lost its predicative functions in a cleft and is now simply a discourse operator \citep{Lambrecht1994,Muller2002,Blanche-Benvensite2002}. This has been argued for Kîîtharaka \citep{AbelsMuriungi2008} and Kikuyu \citep{Schwarz2007}, for example, and is suggested for Kirundi by \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016}. However, considering the variation between \textit{ni} and -\textit{ri} in Kirundi, fulfilling the same function, as well as the fact that the lexical verb in the cleft is marked as relative (by a high tone) suggest that the biclausal cleft structure is still present and the copula functions to create a nominal predicate.

  Finally, there is a negative presentational marker \textit{ntaa}, used in simple assertions as in \xref{bkm:Ref75419400} and \xref{bkm:Ref75419402}, and in presentational constructions as in \xref{bkm:Ref75354090}.

\textit{Ntaa} can be analysed as consisting of negation \textit{nti}- and a stem -\textit{a} \citep{LafkiouiEtAl2016}. Like -\textit{ri}, it changes to the expletive marker \textit{a}- in a dependent clause, followed by negation -\textit{ta}- and stem -\textit{a}. These are illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref73956939} and \xref{bkm:Ref73719164}, respectively. This suggests that we are not dealing with a predicate of existence but one of possession ‘have’; these are known to participate in presentational constructions (cf. French \textit{il y a}, Swahili \textit{ku-na}, see \citealt{Marten2013}).

\subsection{Presentational}
\label{bkm:Ref75348623}
This section summarises the data and analysis by \citet[chapter~6]{Nshemezimana2016} and \citet{NshemezimanaMberamihigo2021}. We refer to these sources for further data and analysis of the presentational construction. The presentational construction with \textit{hari(ho)} consists of the copular verb -\textit{ri} inflected with the expletive subject marker \textit{ha}- and an optional enclitic \textit{=ho}, a noun phrase or pronoun, and a relative clause, as in \xref{bkm:Ref74054848}.

The NP can also be introduced by the inflected\footnote{Note that \textit{fit}- can only be inflected in a limited number of TAM conjugations.} verb \textit{fit-} ‘have’ \xref{bkm:Ref93471637} or a marker \textit{nga}, as in \xref{bkm:Ref106269434}. For further discussion on these variants we refer to \citet{Nshemezimana2016} as well as the discussion in \citet{Marten2013} for Swahili, and here concentrate on the construction with \textit{hari(ho)}.

The subject marker \textit{ha}- is expletive in this construction, not referring to an actual location. When the clitic =\textit{ho} is added, the resulting interpretation is slightly different, as discussed below.

While in \xref{bkm:Ref76658329} both \textit{ha}- and =\textit{ho} are expletive, referring – if to anything – to the current point in the discourse, they can also refer to an actual location. In this case, it is no longer a presentational construction but rather a case of Locative Inversion. For example, in \xref{bkm:Ref73366998}, \textit{ha}- and =\textit{ho} refer to \textit{háno mu rugó} ‘here in the courtyard’, indicating the exact place of the referent that forms the argument of the verb. The relative clause in this example only modifies the NP and could be omitted, in contrast to the presentational constructions, where the relative clause forms part of the construction.\largerpage[2]

An argument could be made to analyse \textit{hari(ho)} as a unit, functioning as a ``presentational marker". If this were the case, the optionality of =\textit{ho} is unexplained, and the ambiguity with Locative Inversion just shown would be unexpected. Furthermore, it would be unclear why the verb is marked as relative. This is instead understood naturally if these are biclausal structures: they consist of a main clause presenting the referent by means of the predicator -\textit{ri}, and a relative clause. Another test would be to see if tense marking is added if the presentational is in the past tense.

What is special about the relative clause in this construction, though, is that it does not contain the typical backgrounded or presupposed information known from a cleft (see \sectref{bkm:Ref81550959}). Instead, the predicate in the relative clause forms part of the presented situation. The newly presented content is not merely the existence or presence of an entity (as in DAI), but a whole situation. The relative clause thus seems to add the same predication as in its non-presentative basic structure in \xref{bkm:Ref75262552} and \xref{bkm:Ref75262560}.

This is also where the construction in \xref{bkm:Ref73366998} differs, as the relative clause here merely provides background information and the main point of information is the existence/presence of the dog in the courtyard.

  The context in which these presentationals are used also indicates that all the information is provided as new. Therefore, these are thetic sentences, used to introduce a referent and at the same time add information about that referent. Crucially, the referent to which the NP in this construction refers is presented as non-topical, but cannot be in focus. This is evident in the unacceptibility of interrogatives in the \textit{hari} construction \xref{bkm:Ref74740077} and its incompatibility with \textit{gusa} ‘only’ \xref{bkm:Ref75426224}, for example.

We conclude that the presentational construction in Kirundi is used for thetic sentences, and consists of an indefinite predicate marked by \textit{hari}(=\textit{ho}) and a relative clause. It therefore formally fits with other types of clefts, as discussed in the next subsections.

\subsection{Basic clefts}
\label{bkm:Ref81550959}
Clefts are another copular construction in Kirundi, consisting of a non-verbal predicate (copula + NP) and a relative clause, as is familiar from languages all around the world. Kirundi being a pro-drop language, it does not feature an expletive in the pre-copular position; hence we follow \citet{Nshemezimana2016} and \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016} and call it a ``basic cleft" instead of an ``it-cleft". The basic cleft is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref76915025}. The relative clause is marked by a high tone, which is variable in its surface position, but indicated in the gloss as part of the final vowel.

For further formal description of basic clefts in Kirundi we refer to \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016}, and here we concentrate on the interpretation. Basic clefts typically express focus on the clefted constituent (the predicative noun following the copula), with the relative clause providing the presupposed, given information, and the clefted constituent being asserted as the referent to which this information applies. This can be seen in the question-answer pair in \xref{bkm:Ref76915336}. Note that the basic cleft can be used for subjects and objects alike.

Unlike the typical exhaustive interpretation that is found in it-clefts in English and other languages \citep[e.g.][]{Horn1981,É.Kiss1998,Declerck1988,Hedberg2000,BeaverClark2008}, the type of focus expressed by the basic cleft in Kirundi seems to be underspecified, as it occurs in various contexts. We present some of these. Apart from simple focus as in Q-A pairs, as in \xref{bkm:Ref142572186}, clefts can be used in ``mention some" contexts \xref{bkm:Ref79134504}, which are necessarily non-exhaustive, but they function equally well in a corrective context \xref{bkm:Ref79134487}, and are compatible with exhaustive \textit{gusa} ‘only’ \xref{bkm:Ref79134496}.

It seems that basic clefts in Kirundi can even be used in thetic contexts, where no information is presupposed. The relative clause here functions similarly to its use in the presentationals (see further \sectref{bkm:Ref75348623}). \citet[98]{LafkiouiEtAl2016} also note this use, and question whether these constructions are actual basic clefts. Silvio Cruschina (p.c.) suggests that: ``They could actually be specificational copular sentences or pseudoclefts with an omitted but implicit initial constituent related to the context and a relative clause attached to the postcopular nominal phrase: e.g. ‘The driver believed that [what caused the noise] was a tree branch that hit the car’, or ‘[The unusual noise that we heard] is a child who had fallen down’.''

An in-between case is presented in \xref{bkm:Ref75343434}, where the clefted constituent forms the answer to the immediate question, but the addition of the relative clause (which does not contain presupposed information) seems to answer a hidden question ‘What was going on?’ or ‘Why were you talking to this person?’, thus resulting in a larger constituent being in focus.

Interestingly, the clefted constituent can be modified by \textit{na} ‘and, also, even’ (in line with the wider non-exclusive use of the basic cleft), but the addition of the scalar additive particle \textit{ndetse} ‘even’ renders the construction ungrammatical. At the moment we do not have a satisfying explanation.

The overall underspecified focus interpretation of the basic cleft means that its precise interpretation is highly context-sensitive, as also concluded by \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016}.

\subsection{Pseudoclefts}

Pseudoclefts are complex structures consisting of two parts \citep{DenDikken2017,Apothéloz2012,Roubaud2000}. The first part is a free relative clause, and the second a predicate noun, in the following example marked by the copula \textit{ni}.

The relative clause here functions as an NP. When the antecedent of the relative clause is a subject, we see a headless relative (``relative autonome" in \citealt[133]{Meeussen1959}) – a nominalisation marked on the verb by an augment and noun class marker corresponding to the noun class of the antecedent, as in \xref{bkm:Ref78794744}. Non\hyp subject relatives, on the other hand, are marked by a pronoun (``pronom précessif" in \citealt{Meeussen1959}), as illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref75856897} where the pronoun \textit{icó} precedes the relative verb (which is marked by a high tone).

The two parts of the pseudocleft have a distinctive intonation, where the first part has a rising intonational contour indicating a continuation, and the second ending with a concluding intonation. This differs from the intonation of basic clefts, which form one intonational phrase. The segmentation is indicated by the brackets in \xref{bkm:Ref75764861}. See again \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016} for further discussion.

Formally, pseudoclefts are copular clauses of which the first part is a free relative. The term ``pseudocleft", however, is only used for specificational copular clauses \xref{bkm:Ref75772945} and not predicational ones, even though it is perfectly possible to create a predicational copular clause of which the first term is a free relative, as in \xref{bkm:Ref75772952}. The difference can be seen in the fact that the identificational copular clause or pseudocleft in \xref{bkm:Ref75772945}, but not the predicational copular clause in \xref{bkm:Ref75772952}, can be used to answer ‘What did you bring?’ (see \citealt{DenDikken2013,DenDikken2017} on predicational and specificational cleft sentences).

From an interpretational point of view, the free relative forms the presupposition (hence needs to be referential) and the predicative noun is the assertion. Together, they result in identificational focus. This is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref75860417}, where the free relative establishes that there exists something that threw him into disarray, and the postcopular noun phrase identifies this as the death of his child.

As the first part of the pseudocleft (the free relative) relates to the previous discourse, the pseudocleft can function as a ``bridge" between the old and new information \citep[244]{Nshemezimana2016}. This is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref106310149}. Since the free relative thus functions as a topic, it can also be marked by the contrastive topic marker -\textit{o}, as shown in \xref{bkm:Ref81816342} above.

The fact that the pseudocleft can be used in ``mention some" contexts, as in \xref{bkm:Ref79138286}, suggests that the focus is not exclusive or exhaustive. The same conclusion is reached for the correction of an incomplete statement, as in \xref{bkm:Ref79138377}: if the statement were interpreted as exhaustive, the corrective reply should have started with ‘no’ (negating the exhaustivity), so the fact that a natural reply starts with ‘yes’ indicates a non-exhaustive focus.

In summary, pseudoclefts in Kirundi (as in other languages) are used to identify a referent, but they can be used in a range of contexts.

\subsection{Reverse pseudocleft / left-peripheral NP + cleft}

In the pseudoclefts discussed above, the precopular part is a free relative and the postcopular noun identifies the referent described by the free relative. These two parts can also be reversed: If the precopular constituent is a referential noun and the copula is followed by a relative, the construction is called a ``reverse pseudocleft", e.g. ‘[Unlimited internet access] is [what I want]’. Kirundi can form two such constructions, which were not yet distinguished by \citet{Nshemezimana2016} or \citet{LafkiouiEtAl2016}. They indicate that the initial constituent plays a double pragmatic role as both topic and focus. Here, we show that there are two underlying structures, and we show that the apparent double role as topic and focus may actually be split between the initial noun phrase and the clefted pronoun.

The first form of reverse pseudocleft is illustrated in \xref{bkm:Ref118966697}. The postcopular part starts with a demonstrative, which either functions as a relative clause marker when it has a high tone as in \xref{bkm:Ref118966697:b}, or as a deictic demonstrative without the high tone, as in \xref{bkm:Ref118966697:a}. Note that in this reverse order, the precopular part is still the topic, and the free relative is the comment/focus, as indicated in the contexts.

The other form of reverse pseudocleft also has an initial noun phrase, a copula, and a relative clause, but here we find no demonstrative but a personal pronoun as the clefted constituent. The verb is still marked relative, as in the basic cleft. In \xref{bkm:Ref78803758}, the NP \textit{abáana} ‘children’ and the pronoun \textit{bó} both refer to the same referent, namely the children.

An alternative analysis of this ``reverse pseudocleft" construction views the initial NP as a separate phrase, and the post-NP part as a basic cleft in which the pronoun is the clefted constituent. Comparing \xref{bkm:Ref78803230:b} with the basic cleft in \xref{bkm:Ref78803230:a}, this analysis takes the pronoun \textit{wé} to be in focus here. The initial NP actually shows some characteristics of a topic, for example the fact that a pause can follow, as indicated by the comma in \xref{bkm:Ref78803230:b} above, and the fact that the initial NP cannot be questioned, shown in \xref{bkm:Ref79142314}. The construction with a question word as in this example can only be interpreted as an echo question, when you haven’t heard well.

What forms the focus is thus not the NP but the pronoun in the cleft: \textit{wé} in \xref{bkm:Ref78803230:b}, \textit{bó} in \xref{bkm:Ref78803758}. \citet{Nshemezimana2016} thus proposes that the referent that both the NP and the pronoun refer to thus fulfils a double pragmatic function: it is referential, taking a topic function, and at the same time it is asserted or identified, forming the focus. In the syntax, these functions are neatly distributed over the NP and the pronoun. In example \xref{bkm:Ref81411744}, it it clear that the initial NP ‘the neighbours’ is given information in the context – what is in focus here is the fact that they are identified as the ones who compromise us with our parents.

However, this analysis as a topic + basic cleft is suboptimal for contexts where the initial NP does function as a focus, for example as the answer to a question, as in \xref{bkm:Ref80957516}, in a correction, as in \xref{bkm:Ref80957526}, or when modified by the exhaustive particle ‘only’, as in \xref{bkm:Ref118968124}.

These could be analysed either as a reverse pseudocleft (i.e. a copular construction with an identificational initial NP that is in focus), or alternatively as a fragment answer followed by a basic cleft with a coreferential pronoun. It is very possible that the construction has multiple underlying structures for what looks to be the same on the surface, but further research is required to confirm this. Further research can also confirm the focus interpretation in this construction: if what follows the initial NP is indeed a basic cleft (with the clefted personal pronoun), we would expect the focus interpretation to be the same as that of the basic cleft. 

\section{Conclusion}

Information structure has a fundamental influence on the morphosyntax of Kirundi. It determines the word order to a large degree, with the requirements for topics in the preverbal domain and a final focus position leading to a range of subject inversion constructions. Verbal inflection is also partly determined by information structure, as shown for the behaviour of the conjoint and disjoint verb forms in a larger range of tests than considered in the literature for Kirundi so far. Newly described in this chapter are the predicate doubling constructions: topic doubling is used for verum (with pragmatic extensions of contrast, intensity, and depreciation), and doubling with an in-situ nominalisation of the same predicate results in a prototypicality reading. Equally new is the description of the agreeing particle -\textit{ó} as a topic marker of a contrastive topic, or inclusive addition when used with \textit{na}. Finally, the chapter has extended earlier descriptions of various copular constructions, pinpointing the focus interpretation of basic clefts, pseudoclefts, and reverse pseudoclefts.

\section*{Abbreviations and symbols}

Numbers refer to noun classes, unless followed by \SG{}/\PL{}, in which case the number (1 or 2) refers to first or second person. Tone marking follows Kirundi tradition; high tones are marked by an acute accent; low tones remain unmarked. Capital N indicates a place-assimilating nasal.
