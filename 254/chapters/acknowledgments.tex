This book stems from the Workshop on Syntactic Agreement that took place on 14.07.2016 at Goethe-University Frankfurt.  We would firstly like to thank all the participants and attendees of the workshop for contributing to an excellent and stimulating workshop. Secondly, we would like to express our gratitude to Language Science Press and Open Generative Syntax for their eagerness to publish this volume and we are very thankful to all the reviewers who improved the contents of the volume considerably. Lastly, but at least equally importantly, we would like to thank all the people who supported us in the editorial  process of the volume: Lena Merkens, Beata Moskal, Corinna Trabandt, and Felix Kopecky.
