We would like to express our gratitude to the participants of the section ``Indefinites in Romance. The limits of an instable category" at the 36th Romanistentag (Kassel) for fruitful insights and discussions about the topic of this volume. This section was organized in association with the DFG project â€œQuantification in Old Italian" (directed by Cecilia Poletto and Guido Mensching), of which both Olga Kellert and Sebastian Lauschus were project members. Special thanks go to Sophie Corazolla, who provided invaluable help in the formatting of this volume. We are also grateful to the editorial team of the Open Romance Linguistics series and Lukas Heeg for careful editing and troubleshooting.

The editors of the volume are listed in alphabetic order. Olga Kellert and Malte Rosemeyer were in charge of all content-related matters. Sebastian Lauschus and Malte Rosemeyer coordinated the formatting of the volume.
