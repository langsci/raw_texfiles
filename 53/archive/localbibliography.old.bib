He presents four arguments for biological innateness of psychological capacities, parallel to arguments in biology for the innateness of physical traits:

Universal appearance across time for a group. Not just an artifact of cultural history. Again, "species typical" diagnostic feature.
No learning of the trait is possible.
Individual development of a trait rigidly follows a given schedule regardless of the particular experience of the organism.

experimental results:
* ONLY half the participants used goal object description strategy [fahre zum linke wuerfel]
* other strategies 1) path [1 meter geradaus, dann 2 meter links...] 2) action [drehe das hintere rad]
* group-based reference occurs often
* speakers adapt by reducing linguistic complexity (simpler lexicon, less morphology, use of infinitives
* speakers almost exclusively used robot's perspective (also expressively asked for the robot's front)

total 183 instructions:
* 102/183 group based reference
* 69/102 used particular expression scheme
* 19/43 cardbox was used as reference object

quotes:
"Thus, the issue at hand is, 'Which of these similar objects do you refer to?'. This perspective triggers ways of linguistic reference hitherto largely ignored in the literature on spatial reference systems" (pp 3)

Here, we consider the ways that space and the things in it are schematized in perception and cognition, as well as in language. We propose the Schematization Similarity Conjecture: to the extent that space is schematized similarly in language and cognition, language will be successful in conveying space. We look at the evidence in both language and perception literature to support this view. Finally, we analyze schematizations of routes conveyed in sketch maps or directions, finding parallels in the kind of information omitted and retained in both.}
