 \section {``Creole'': The people} \label{2.1}
 An online search for additional literature, to add to those already sourced for this research, concerning superstrate and creole languages respectively, led to an article entitled \textit{The Context of Wide Sargasso Sea > Social\slash Political Context > Creole Identity and Language}.\footnote{\url{http://crossref-it.info/textguide/Wide-Sargasso-Sea/29/1915}, last accessed on November 12, 2018.} This article presented a discussion about the social and political context in relation to Creole identity and language in the novel Wide Sargasso Sea. The novel, written by Dominican-born author Jean Rhys, which is set in the 1966 postcolonial era, told the story of heiress Antoinette Cosway. The article mentioned the fact that the term ``Creole'' was originally used to refer to Whites of British (like Rhys' Antoinette) and/or of other European parentage, who were born in the Caribbean. A subsequent read of \citegen{Page97}  review of Wide Sargasso Sea highlighted the following:
 
  \begin{quotation}
[Antoinette] ... is descended from the plantation owners, and her father has had many children by Negro women. She can be accepted neither by the Negro community nor by the representatives of the colonial centre. \underline {As a white creole she is nothing}. The taint of racial impurity, coupled with the suspicion that she is mentally imbalanced brings about her inevitable downfall .... 
\end{quotation}

Confronted, again, by the concept of ``White Creole'', there was a need to find out more about this concept and this led to the works of \citet{Saxon89} and \citet{Ward04}. Both works expressed the fact that in New Orleans, for example, the term ``Creole'' provoked two distinct responses. The first response was that Creoles were children of  ``... European parents born in a French or Spanish colony'' \citep[270]{Saxon89}. The second response was that the term refers to ``someone whose ancestors came to the colonies from France or Spain, who was born in Louisiana, and who may be light-skinned and black as well'' \citep[xiv]{Ward04}. However, the Creoles who gave the first response, would never agree with the last half of the second response, i.e. that Creoles can be ``light-skinned and black''. This is despite the fact that their own ancestors ``... fathered mixed-race children'' with Black slave paramours \citep[xiv]{Ward04}.

The term ``Creole'', when it is applied to Whites, such as Rhys's Antoinette, most often refers to rich, upper class, and land-owning descendants of Europeans, who were born in the Americas (see \citealt{Cassidy82}). These White Creoles, by virtue of the fact that their nannies, playmates and servants were most often enslaved Africans, spoke a creole language such as Sranan \citep{Cassidy82}. However, the main focus of this research is not on this group of people. Instead, the focus is on the speech of poor Whites, these being the indentured servants who came to the Caribbean colonies. These poor Whites and their descendants, who came to exist in socially isolated communities, preserved to varying extents the language forms of their British forefathers (see \citealt{Aceto10} and \citealt{Williams03}).

Apart from the use of the term ``Creole'' in reference to ``pure'' (unmixed) Whites of Caribbean origin, the line ``... As a white creole she is nothing ...'' stood out to me. It made me wonder about the language of these White Creoles, and also of the poor Whites, who in large numbers migrated to the colonies as indentured servants (see \chapref{ch:6}). According to historians such as \citet{Galenson02}, it was common practice for enslaved Africans and white indentured servants to work side-by-side on plantations. This sociolinguistic situation represented a perfect scenario for intense language contact. Black speech in Caribbean had been widely studied but had Creole linguists ever thought to study the language of these poor Whites? The answer to this question was yes, but not to any significant degree. According to \citet{Williams03}, early research of this kind had been ``hindered by a lack of knowledge of ``white'' dialects ... [and] ... the work that has been done has generally suffered from a lack of understanding of the social and cultural dynamics of ``whiteness'' in Anglophone West Indian contexts'' \citep[95]{Williams03}.

How would the findings of this research relate to the body of research on the language of the descendants of these poor Whites? This was one of three important questions to address whilst tackling the three research questions presented in \chapref{ch:1} (see \chapref{ch:7} for the remaining two questions). In \chapref{ch:7}, I compare the findings from the contemporary works of \citet{Aceto10}, \citet{Williams03}, \citet{Blake04} and others, and the significance of their work within the context of my findings. These linguists researched what \citet[30]{Trudgill02} referred to as the ``lesser-known varieties of English''. These are a set of relatively unstudied, native varieties of English that are spoken in some parts of the English-speaking world \citep{Trudgill02}. What is the language spoken by the descendants of these poor Whites? Is it English, or a ``Caribbeanized'' dialect of English? In most cases, it is the same or similar to the linguistic code used by Blacks (see \citealt{Cassidy82}).

 \section {``Creole'' language and theories of genesis}\label{2.2}
What exactly are ``creole'' languages and how are they formed? McWhorter, in his work \emph {Defining Creole} \citep{McWhorter05}, expressed the fact that after years of established Creole Language Studies, no consensus had yet been reached as to what a creole really is. Defining this concept, according to  \citet{McWhorter05}, was/is such a sensitive issue that some researchers felt it best to leave it alone. Notwithstanding the challenge involved in defining the term ``creole'', various linguists, such as \citet{Kihm80} and \citet{Chaudenson92}, used the word as a socio-historical term ``referring to certain languages born as lingua francas amidst heavy contact between two or more languages'' \citep[9]{McWhorter05}. This definition is an example of one of three main types of definitions that \citet{Hickey97} claimed to have identified within the field of Creole Linguistics. He classified these three types as ``External'', ``Acquisitional'' and ``Structural''.

An External definition, such as that presented above, considers factors outside of the language itself; a ``creole'' is therefore defined based on its sociolinguistic historical context of development. Acquisitional definitions identify creoles as language varieties that arose in situations where a generation of speakers developed these languages from significantly reduced and imperfectly acquired colonial lexifiers. Structural definitions identify creoles as languages that have undergone reformation with respect to their lexifier language(s) and possibly substrate languages \citep{Hickey97}.

These definitional types originated from the various theories of genesis that had been presented for the various languages labelled ``creoles''. These theories can be grouped together according to those that focus on the influence of European lexifiers, those that focus on non-European influence, and those that regard ``... universals of language acquisition and/or language-internal development as the crucial factor in creole genesis'' \citep[3]{Braun09}. As with the three categories of definitions for ``creole'' highlighted by  \citet{Hickey97}, the theories of creole genesis can be grouped into three main types. The more contemporary versions of these are briefly presented hereafter, under the headings \emph{Eurocentric theories of creole genesis}, \emph{Non-Eurocentric theories of creole genesis} and \emph{Language universal theories of creole genesis}. The presentation of these approaches is followed by a discussion of where all three types of approaches converge.

\subsection {Eurocentric theories of creole genesis} \label{2.2.1}
Theories that regard the impact of European influences as being the most vital to creole formation, range for example, from the early works of \citet{Bloomfield33}, \citet{Hall66}, \citet{Ferguson71}, to the more recent works of \citet{Chaudenson92}, and \citet{Mufwene01, Mufwene08, Mufwene08b}. The core principle of Eurocentric theories of genesis is that creoles are approximations of their European lexifiers \citep[43]{Baker00}.  \citet{Mufwene08}, for instance, suggested that ``in all ... cases of language evolution, the action of competition among competing ... systems is evident '' \citep[58]{Mufwene08}. Furthermore, in language contact settings involving one target language (the lexifier), with the other language(s) involved offering some competition, ``... learners ... normally approximate the pattern provided by speakers of the target language'' \citep[122]{Mufwene08}. The same is claimed to be true for those socio-historical contact situations that resulted in the linguistic systems referred to as ``creoles''.

In these situations, i.e. those leading to the formation of ``creoles'', Europeans and non-Europeans interacted regularly and since non-Europeans had no one with whom to use their own ethnic language(s), the features of the founder populations, i.e. of the European language, had the advantage in the majority of their linguistic forms being selected over non-European ones \citep{Mufwene96}. One effect of this was that children born into such situations, and also their parents, might not have seen knowledge of such non-European languages as particularly necessary \citep{Mufwene08b}. In fact, this might be one of the major reasons why ``... structural features of creoles ... [are seemingly] ... predetermined to a large extent (though not exclusively) by characteristics of the vernaculars spoken by the populations that founded the colonies in which they developed'' \citep[28]{Mufwene96}. Mufwene's assertions, as with those of many other superstratists, were influenced by what \citep[3]{Braun09} referred to ``... as one of the much debated ... [Superstratist] ... approaches'', i.e. Chaudenson's \citep{Chaudenson92} theory of genesis.

According to  \citet{Braun09},  \citet{Chaudenson92} viewed creoles ``as modifications of non-standard European superstrates with little influence from the native languages of the slaves'' \citep[3]{Braun09}. \citet{Chaudenson92} asserted that when we closely examine how colonial societies got their start, we will see that ``... the duration of the period during which Whites were more numerous than Blacks was considerable, and conditions did not change on the very day the black population outnumbered the white population...'' \citep[60]{Chaudenson92}. Since this was the case, what he referred to as `first generation creoles', such as Sranan, Jamaican, etc., would therefore be approximations of the European language(s) spoken by the Whites. This assertion was voiced from within his earlier work on French creoles in which he posited that these creoles, i.e. French-lexicon creoles, could be traced back to a particular French dialect spoken in 17\textsuperscript{th} and 18\textsuperscript{th} century France, i.e. the dialect that was in use in the Normandy region \citep{Chaudenson79}.  \citet{Chaudenson79} claimed that there was no need for Blacks to outnumber the Whites for a creole to have developed. In fact, (French) creoles would have developed while the lexifier language was still relatively accessible. In such socio-linguistic conditions, where the Whites, who spoke vernacular French, still outnumbered the Blacks, these Blacks were no doubt motivated to abandon their native language(s) to be able to communicate with others \citep{Chaudenson79}.

In defence of his assertions,  \citet{Chaudenson01} stated that even those theorists that advocate for a non-European focus in creole genesis all agree that ``for the most part, creolization has occurred through collective, imperfect, and approximate ``learning'' of French (or, more generally, any other lexifier) ...'' \citep{Chaudenson01}. The most extreme of these Non-Eurocentric theorists is Mervyn Alleyne, who in his \emph{Comparative Afro-American} work \citep{Alleyne80} claimed that the most essential language influences during the periods of creole geneses, specifically for English-lexicon creoles, were the Non-European (African) languages present in the colonies. This is discussed in the following section.

\subsection {Non-Eurocentric theories of creole genesis} \label{2.2.2}
Non-Eurocentric accounts of origin, which are hereafter referred to simply as Substratist approaches, have their origin in the early 19\textsuperscript{th} century works of philologists such as  \citet{Baissac80}. The essence of the Superstrate approaches is that ``creole'' languages owe much of their development to the influence of the African (substrate) language(s) that were present during the creole formation period. \citet{Mufwene90, Mufwene96b} identified three main types of Substratist models: the first type, for which the proponents are  \citet{Alleyne80, Alleyne96} and  \citet{Holm89}, ``identifies the source of individual features in diverse substrate languages... that must have been represented in the ethnolinguistic ecological setting of the relevant contact'' \citep[167]{Mufwene96b}; the second type, endorsed by  \citet{Lefebvre98, Lefebvre04} and  \citet{Lumsden99}, posited a process of ``relexification'', i.e. the replacement of L1 (substrate language) lexical items with their L2 (European) counterparts; the third type of substratist approach, endorsed by  \citet{Keesing88}, ``... validates substrate influence with the relative typological homogeneity of languages in contact with the lexifier'' \citep[167]{Mufwene96b}.

The substratist theory of creole genesis presented by \citet{Alleyne80} could be considered to be the most extreme of those highlighted in the previous paragraph \citep{Byrne87}. In fact, his account is in stark contrast to the most extreme superstratist approach (see \sectref{2.2.1}).  \citet{Alleyne80} asserted that the creole languages that he focused on (Atlantic English lexicon Creoles), in which he included the \textsc{ssa} creoles, are essentially a continuity of the African languages that went into their development. Alleyne supported his claim via the presentation of his observation that ``... the rules which account for [serial verb constructions] are basically the same in... [the Atlantic Creoles] as in Kwa languages [African substrate]'' (\citeyear[167]{Alleyne80}) and that the characteristics of serialization in the Kwa languages ``seem to be closer to Saramaccan than to other... [Atlantic Creole]... dialects'' \citep[167]{Alleyne80}. Alleyne based most of his assumptions on the observations he made of Saramaccan, which in his view ``... may represent the oldest layer of creole known to us...'' and thus the least altered from its substrate \citep[91]{Alleyne79}.

The \textsc{ssa} creoles seemed to represent a haven for most creole linguistic study, including my own, given their peculiar differences from other English creoles, such as [\textipa{kouru}] for \textit{cold} where others have [\textipa{kuol}]. These creoles were/are so favoured that even those theorists who advocate for linguistic universals, as opposed to (Non-)Eurocentric accounts, make reference to them, specifically Saramaccan, as ``radical creoles'' (cf. \citealt{Bickerton77, Bickerton81, Bickerton84, Bickerton99}). These radical creoles as expressed by  \citet[3]{Byrne87} were so-called because ``[their] ... grammars come closer to approximating the unmarked state of our innate, genetically endowed facult\'{e} de langage.'' Just as the Superstratist and Substratist schools had/have their most extreme advocates in the form of \citet{Chaudenson01} and  \citet{Alleyne80}, respectively,  \citet{Bickerton77, Bickerton81, Bickerton84, Bickerton99} is the theorist most associated with Universalist theories of creole genesis.

\subsection {Language universal theories of creole genesis} \label{2.2.3}
Bickerton's (\citeyear{Bickerton77, Bickerton81, Bickerton84, Bickerton99}) Language (Universal) Bioprogram Hypothesis, hereafter \textsc{lbh}, asserted that creole languages, in particular Saramaccan, closely approximated, neither their superstrates nor their substrates but the inborn, genetically endowed, ``facult\'{e} de langage'' that all humans are born with \citep[158]{Bickerton84}. The importance and reliance in this `faculty of language' is echoed in the work \citet{DeGraff01}, who defined ``creole'' as ``... the product of extraordinary external (sociohistorical) factors coupled with ordinary (internal) linguistic resources inherent to the human facult\'{e} de langage'' \citep[11]{DeGraff01}.

Bickerton's (\citeyear{Bickerton77, Bickerton81, Bickerton84, Bickerton99}) biological predisposition for language comes with certain preset features such as a natural tense-aspect schema that is embedded in certain neural pathways of the brain  \citep{Bickerton75}. In his own words,  \citet[2]{Bickerton81} stated the following: ``... all members of our species are born with a bioprogram for language which can function in the absence of adequate input.''

Bickerton's (\citeyear{Bickerton77, Bickerton81, Bickerton84, Bickerton99}) hypothesis seemingly paralleled particular components of Superstratist theories. The reasons for making this assertion are found in the following aspects of Bickerton's (\citeyear{Bickerton77, Bickerton81, Bickerton84, Bickerton99}) theory of the genesis of creole languages, specifically English creole languages:

\begin{enumerate}
\item European plantation owners in need of a large-scale labour force imported enslaved Africans to work for them. Consequently, pidginization of these European languages took place. This pidginization process was in essence second-language learning, characterized by limited access to, and therefore inadequate acquisition of, the European lexifier languages \citep{Bickerton77}. This, of course, resulted in the demise of the African languages which had little or no part to play in the process.
\item Children born into these multi-linguistic ecologies, whilst learning these relatively unstable pidgins \citep[49]{Bickerton77}  as their first languages, ``[received] ... restrictive input ...'' and for this reason their  built-in grammars, which are conditioned by the bioprogram, were triggered, and continued into adulthood (cf. \citealt{Bickerton79, Bickerton84, Bickerton81}). Whilst all this was occurring, the adults' linguistic repertoires, with more and more access to the European lexifiers, were also developing. These adults were moving away from both their L1s (native languages) and a soon-to-be obsolete and extremely flexible pidgin \citep{Bickerton81}. Creole languages were the linguistic outcome of these two co-occurring events.
\end{enumerate}

The \textsc{lbh}, however, disregarded the creole languages of the descendants of ``White Creoles'' and poor White indentured servants (see \citealt{Schumann83, Cassidy82}), which were/are spoken in Suriname and around the English world (see \citealt{Trudgill02}). 

\subsection {Where all theories of creole genesis concur}\label{2.2.4}
What is evident from the discussions presented in \sectref{2.2.1} to \sectref{2.2.3} is that the typological classification of creoles is a major long-standing issue for Creole linguists, and though several theories of genesis have been proposed, it seems that one agreed upon theory of origin might never be found. Notwithstanding, all theorists, including those discussed in the previous sections, agree that in most cases the majority of the lexical entries in ``creoles'' are derived from their lexifier languages, more specifically from 17\textsuperscript{th} century regional dialects of their European lexifier languages \citep{Chaudenson92, Chaudenson01, Mufwene96, Mufwene08, Lefebvre04, McWhorter05}. Of these theorists, two seminal works from within the same theoretical school of thought, i.e. the Superstratist camp, provided me with varying theories regarding the nature of this Superstrate lexical influence. These were Mufwene's (\citeyear{Mufwene01, Mufwene08}) `All-the-dialects view', referred to hereafter as the pan-dialectal account, and  Chaudenson's (\citeyear{Chaudenson79, Chaudenson92, Chaudenson01}) `Single-dialect view', hereafter the mono-dialectal account.

\subsubsection {The mono-dialectal account}\label{2.2.4.1}
 Chaudenson's (\citeyear{Chaudenson79}) work, as mentioned in \sectref{2.2.1}, addressed French creoles, specifically those spoken in and around the Indian Ocean. He was able to show that the linguistic features noticed in these creoles could be traced back to a particular 17\textsuperscript{th} to 18\textsuperscript{th} century French dialect spoken in Normandy (Western France). Chaudenson did a detailed comparison of the structural correspondences between various French Creole reflexes and their French dialectal etyma. The assertion that French creoles were genetically derived from 17\textsuperscript{th} to 18\textsuperscript{th} century French was asserted from within the early works of \citet{Hall53}, and \citet{Goodman64}, whereas  \citet{Chaudenson79} was the first to pinpoint a precise dialect of French from which this influence could be said to have originated.

\subsubsection {The pan-dialectal account}\label{2.2.4.2}
Mufwene's (\citeyear{Mufwene01}) pan-dialectal account described a creole's lexical influence as being made up of ``... composite varieties from among diverse dialects of the same language ...'' (p.~3). This account provided a counter thesis to Chaudenson's account of Superstrate influence. According to \citet{Mufwene08}, ``... the target for those who made the creoles consisted of several non-standard varieties [of the 17\textsuperscript{th} and 18\textsuperscript{th} century European lexifier languages that were] competing with each other...'' (p.~21). These dialects developed into a new colonial dialect that preserved at its core a mixture of common features found across the diverse dialects of the lexifier language. These competing features were thrown into a pan-dialectal ``feature pool'', thereby becoming accessible for selection by colonial speech communities \citep{Mufwene08, Mufwene01}. Survival of these features was ensured if they were more frequent, more salient, and/or more transparent than other alternatives. Survival was also guaranteed if a competing feature appeared in one of the other languages present during the creole formation period, for example one or more of the West African languages \citep{Mufwene01}.

\subsubsection {The pan-dialectal account vs. the mono-dialectal Account}\label{2.2.4.3}
There is a possibility that Chaudenson is right as it relates to French-lexicon creole languages and Mufwene is equally right about English-lexicon creole languages. However, there is also the possibility that a Chaudenson-type approach might better account for the nature of the English input in English-lexicon creoles. Since this is the case one of the questions that this research attempted to answer is which of the two accounts, i.e. Chaudenson's Mono-dialectal account or Mufwene's pan-dialectal account, better explains the nature and origin of the lexical and phonetic input in Sranan. To this end, this work refrains from focusing on the debate surrounding when, or how, what we know as modern Sranan was formed. Instead, using some of the oldest and most available secondary Sranan data, an attempt was made to reconstruct and trace the 17\textsuperscript{th} century putative English input that would have influenced the Surinamese proto-language that soon developed into Proto-Sranan and the two other \textsc{ssa} creoles, i.e. Proto-Saramaccan and Proto-Aukan. In so doing an attempt was made to investigate whether there were multiple dialectal inputs from all over England or a single dialectal input from within a specific region.

\subsection{The search for Sranan's English dialectal influence}
One seminal work, which addressed the Superstrate origins of the Surinamese English creoles, is Smith's (\citeyear{Smith87}), \textit{The genesis of the creole languages of Surinam}. In this work Smith used Historical Phonology and attempted to reconstruct the linguistic shape and origin of \textsc{ssa}'s 17\textsuperscript{th} century European input.  \citet[6]{Smith87}, utilising knowledge of  ``... seventeenth century English and Portuguese...'' alongside 18\textsuperscript{th} and 19\textsuperscript{th} century \textsc{ssa} data sources, attempted to find and discuss the correspondences between them. Smith's (\citeyear{Smith87}) major concern was the origin and ``linguistic interrelationships'' between \textsc{ssa}'s lexical and phonological influences, i.e. English, Dutch and Portuguese.

Smith's (\citeyear{Smith87}) work, like Mufwene's (\citeyear{Mufwene01}), points to 17\textsuperscript{th} century regional dialects of English as the input for English Creoles. However, similar to \citet{Chaudenson79}, \citet{Smith87} was more explicit about the nature of \textsc{ssa}'s English input. He proposed `Standard Early Modern London English', with some input from regional non-standard dialects around London, as the main input for \textsc{ssa} \citep{Smith08, Smith87}. Given Smith's proposed ``London English'' account of origin, alongside determining whether a mono-dialectal account or a pan-dialectal account of origin can best explain Sranan's English Superstrate origin, one of the other major issues that this research also addressed was whether Smith's proposal is trustworthy. What this meant was that, in trying to determine whether the English dialectal influence in Sranan was from a composite of dialects \citep{Mufwene08, Mufwene01} from all over England, or a single regional dialect, there was also an attempt to determine whether Smith's proposed ``London-English'' was the only source of Sranan's English linguistic influence. In doing so, Smith's (\citeyear{Smith87}) work was taken as a stepping stone for this current research. However, whereas Smith's (\citeyear{Smith87}) work focussed on determining in a more general way the European origins (from Portuguese, Dutch and English) of Sranan's lexical and phonetic influences, this current research focussed solely on the English dialectal influence(s) from within England in a bid to find the dialect or dialects from within England that were of linguistic influence.

In a perfect world where things are as plain as ``black and white'', and shades of  ``grey'' are non-existent, an agreed upon definition of ``creole'' exists and the answers to all questions surrounding ``creole'' would have already been found. Sadly, this is not that perfect world; however, whatever the term ``creole'', in reference to language, means to the various researchers in the field of Creole Linguistics, it is generally accepted that Sranan is a creole language. This being the case, in taking Smith's (\citeyear{Smith87}) work as a stepping stone (see \chapref{ch:3}), a tripartite methodological model was created to determine the dialectal origin(s), in England, of those lexical and phonetic influences that needed to be present during the formation of this creole language. The components of this methodological model are discussed in the following chapter. This model consists of statistical analysis, Dialect Geography techniques and analysis of 17\textsuperscript{th} century England migration history. As will become evident in the following chapters, the rationale behind using this methodological model is that it allowed for triangulation of results from three diverse types of analyses. Such corroboration of the results across all three types of analyses meant a higher degree of trustworthiness. This model and the data that were used in this research are discussed in greater detail in the following chapter.
