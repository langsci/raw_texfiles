\addchap{Acknowledgements} 


Much of the work presented in this volume was made possible through funding from the Research Council of Norway for the project \textit{Constraints on syntactic variation: Noun phrases in early Germanic languages} (grant no. 261847). We are very grateful to the Research Council for this funding, and in general for their willingness to fund projects on historical linguistics.

We also thank the Nansen Foundation for funding for two workshops at an early stage; this enabled us to carry out a pilot project, which then led to the application for funding from the Research Council.

Academic publishing would not be possible without the efforts of reviewers, and this volume is no exception. We thank our distinguished colleagues, whose insightful comments have certainly improved the quality of the chapters: Cynthia Allen, Ellen Brandner, Laurel Brinton, Östen Dahl, Ulrike Demske, Dag Haug, Hanne Eckhoff, Olga Fischer, Sebastian Kürschner,  Dorian Roehrs, Said Sahel, Christopher Sapp, Einar Freyr Sigurðsson, Dominika Skrzypek, Ann Taylor, and Alexander Werth.

We are also much obliged to members of the project group, who, in good community spirit, have helped with \LaTeX{} work: Hannah Booth, Kersti Börjars, Gerlof Bouma, George Walkden and his assistant Carola Malang. And speaking of community spirit, we thank the community proofreaders for their sharp eyes and useful comments in the final editing stage.  

Finally we thank the series editors Michael T. Putnam, Hanna Fischer, David Natvig, Richard Page, and Laura Catharine Smith for accepting this volume for the \textit{Open Germanic Linguistics} series, and Sebastian Nordhoff and Felix Kopecky at Language Science Press for their suggestions and expertise in preparing the book for publication.
