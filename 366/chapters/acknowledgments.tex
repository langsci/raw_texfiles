\addchap{Acknowledgements} 

This book was written without any financial support; nonetheless, I would like to express my gratitude to SmarTerp, especially Susana Rodriguez, for allowing me to conduct my research on their software. I am indebted to all the friends, colleagues, reviewers, and editors who contributed to this work. A special thanks goes to my cousin Dr Mario De Florio, who took care of the \LaTeX\ typesetting; without you, I wouldn't have made it (surely not in this timeframe). Publishing a book does take a village, and I am grateful to you all for making this happen.
