\section{Transcript}

\noindent Good morning ladies and gentlemen, \\
Thank you so much for joining us here today. As you know organising this conference this year has taken extra organisational efforts given the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, we are particularly glad and grateful that the conference could take place and that some of us could even be here in person in spite of the adverse circumstances. If everyone has taken their seats and the technicians confirm that the live streaming is functioning properly, I shall start with my address. [0.3 pause] \\


\begin{itemize}
    \item H.E. Paul Kagame, 
    \item Hon. Soraya Hakuziyaremye, Rwanda’s MINICOM [Ministry of Trade and Industry] Minister, 
    \item Ms Giovanie Biha, UNECA [United Nations Economic Commission for Africa] Deputy Executive Secretary, 
    \item Ladies and gentlemen. [0.3 pause] 
\end{itemize}

\noindent It is my utmost pleasure to see so many participants in this historic room that we chose to host our conference. And it is also remarkable that many participants are following this conference from countries across the continent. On behalf of H.E. President Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, it is my honour and pleasure to welcome you to this conference. It is our hope that today’s conference will promote a fruitful dialogue and stimulate collaborations among African countries, which is one of the key objectives of the African Union. [0.3 pause] \\

\noindent Before I go on talking about the African Union and the road ahead for Africa, I would like to remind you of today’s programme: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item After my introductory remarks and the address by our Chairman, H.E. Tschikedi Tschilombo, we will hear the keynote speech ‘Made in Africa: towards realizing Africa’s Structural Transformation for the achievement of Agenda 2063’ by H.E. Kwesi Quartey, AUC’s [African Union Commission] Deputy Chairman. 
    \item We will then hear an address by H.E. Professor Victor Harison, our new Commissioner for the DEA [Department of Economic Affairs], titled ‘Rethinking continental initiatives and regional cooperation’. 
    \item After a 30’ break, 
    \item we will have a 90’ panel discussion 
    \item and finish off with a Q\&A session. [0.3 pause]
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Ladies and Gentlemen, \\\largerpage
As you know this annual gathering reflects the mission of the African Union: To achieve greater unity, cohesion and solidarity between the African countries and African nations and to accelerate the political and social-economic integration of the continent. There are several signs that we are on the right track. \\

The continent currently has a gross domestic product of USD 3.42 trillion. This represents a remarkable achievement if we consider the fast pace of our economic growth over the past decades. [0.3 pause] \\

The economic growth will be accompanied, in the years to come, by a massive demographic growth. Our growing population represents an invaluable asset for Africa. This is why the African Union has been promoting the development of an African single market, which would have the largest consumer base in the world. The signing of the AfCFTA [the African Continental Free Trade Area] by the African Member States significantly strengthens the movement towards this goal. [0.3 pause] \\\largerpage

Furthermore, while other countries are facing the challenge of an ageing population, Africa’s working-age population is growing rapidly and is projected to surpass that of any other continent by 2030: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item By 2030, the African continent would add about 295 million new people aged 15-to-64. 
    \item The growth would push the number of 15-to-64-year-old Africans up by 40\% by 2030. 
    \item By 2030, Africa would hence be home to nearly 1 billion people of 15 to 64 years of age. [0.3 pause] 
\end{itemize}

There is no doubt that Africa’s population is a precious resource for the further growth of the continent. And this is certainly not our only asset. Let us not forget that Africa has a wealth of natural resources: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In 2019, Africa produced nearly 8.41 mbd [million barrels per day] of oil. 
    \item Madagascar alone produced approximately 58,000 metric tons of nickel in 2021. 
    \item Namibia's diamond production amounted to 2.52 million carats in 2018. [0.3 pause]
\end{itemize}

Africa’s abundance of natural resources represents a huge potential for the continent’s economic growth and could generate shared prosperity for all. Our soil is rich in high-value praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium. These are very rare elements, for which global demand is constantly growing. [0.3 pause] \\

Such growing demand is reflected in the market value of our mining companies. This year, the market cap of AngloGold Ashanti – the largest mining company headquartered in Africa – was USD 12.13 billion. [0.3 pause]\\

Africa is also rich in natural gases – much cleaner and cheaper than fossil fuels, which explains the constantly growing global demand. Analysts forecast that African production of LNG [liquefied natural gas] will increase by 150\% from 28 mtpy [million tonnes per year] in 2018 to reach 84 mtpy by 2025. [0.3 pause] \\

We not only expect natural gas demand to continue rising over the years but also to support Africa’s transition to green growth. Though its contribution to the total energy mix is still modest, coal-bed methane has impressive potential. The development and utilization of coal-bed methane are of great social and economic benefit. It is a clean-burning fuel for domestic and industrial uses. [0.3 pause] \\

Furthermore, the porous high-rank coal matrix, with larger hy\-dro\-car\-bon-stor\-age capacity, makes coal-bed methane reservoirs advantageous for commercial operations. [0.3 pause] \\

\noindent Ladies and gentlemen, \\
We are advancing towards the AU’s vision of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena. This, however, can only be realized with the full participation of all stakeholders. Which is why events like this conference are so important. 
Thank you for your attention and your participation. I wish you fruitful discussions.

\section{Transcript}

\noindent Good morning ladies and gentlemen, \\
\noindent Our session is just about to start in few minutes, so please make sure to check your camera and microphone settings. While we wait for all participants to connect, let me say that I am very pleased that you could all join this forum. We intended to create an arena for thoughtful discussion and debate, which is all the most important in these challenging times of an enduring global pandemic. I see that all participants have connected now, so I will start with my welcome address. [0.3 pause] \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item H.E. Tarō Asō, Deputy Prime Minister, 
    \item Honourable Hiroshige Sekō, METI [Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry] Minister, 
    \item Distinguished Fumio Hayashi, Professor at GRIPS [National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies], 
    \item Ladies and Gentlemen, distinguished colleagues. [0.3 pause] 
\end{itemize}

\noindent Good morning. \\
It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with leaders in administrative, financial, and economic areas in Kanagawa-ken [Kanagawa Prefecture], which is taking place online due to the continuing impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). [0.3 pause] \\

At the January MPM [Monetary Policy Meeting], we heard the outlook for Japan's economic activity through the coming fiscal year. While the pandemic had an impact on our economy and society, the overall outlook appears to be positive. [0.3 pause] \\

Despite the adverse circumstances, our country remains a global economic force. Japan has a GDP of USD 5.38 trillion. This means that, although our economy had the biggest decline on record in the aftermath of the pandemic, it is now recovering. [0.3 pause]\\

In my address today, I would like to remind us of the strengths of the Japanese economy and open the discussion on how to make it even more resilient and competitive in the years to come. Before I continue with my address, let me remind you of the programme for today’s conference:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item My welcome address will be followed by a keynote speech by Honourable Hiroshige Sekō, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry. 
    \item Kuroda Haruhiko, Governor of the Bank of Japan, will then honour us with a presentation on the topic ‘Japan’s Economic and Monetary Policy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.’

Distinguished colleagues, While COVID-19 has had a significant impact on social and economic activities, this also could be an opportunity to reform the economic structure that will strengthen the growth potential. \\
Let us think for instance of the various efforts to use information and communication technology in such areas as telework and online medical care. This increased use led to new innovative solutions and boosted the growth of our communication network, which is considered the most advanced in the world. The importance of telecommunications in our country is reflected in the market value of SFTBF [SoftBank], which has reached USD 159.60 billion. This is one of the examples of how our society and economy can make the most of the harsh experience of COVID-19. [0.3 pause] \\

Exports have traditionally been a core pillar of the Japanese economy. Before the pandemic, Japan was and remains a global exporter of metals. Japan’s export of hot-rolled iron increased by 3.51\% from 12.5 million tons in YTD [year to date] 2018 to 16.85 million tons in YTD 2019. Although exports decreased when the pandemic hit, they have been witnessing a steady increase over the current fiscal year. [0.3 pause] \\ 

\begin{sloppypar}
Our machinery and equipment are still considered a synonym of quality around the world. Japanese machinery, like our high-performance spinning extruders are leaders in the plastics manufacturing industry. [0.3 pause] \\
\end{sloppypar}

Recent trends in Japan's exports offer further evidence of an ongoing trade recovery built around tech. Our top exports include core pieces of equipment in microchip manufacturing, such as microassemblies, semiconductor lithography equipment, and wire enamel. These are key components and devices supporting the information-oriented society and we expect that their export volumes will continue to increase in the next years. [0.3 pause] \\

Looking at the road ahead, we are committed to economic growth that is sustainable not only from a financial and social but also from an environmental point of view. Japan is progressing towards its green goals of meeting a larger share of its electricity demand through biomass-derived power: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Japan's domestic production of woody biomass increased to 10.2 million BDt [bone-dry metric tons] in 2020. 
    \item By 2022, the new biomass plant in Aichi-ken will add 75 megawatts to Japan’s production capacities. 
    \item The prefecture of Kyushu alone imported 0.71 million metric tons of PKS [palm kernel shells] in 2018. 
\end{itemize}
These figures are promising because biomass-derived power sets Japan on course to become a carbon-neutral society. [0.3 pause] \\

In our debates today as well as our policymaking for the years to come, we cannot fail to take into account one of the main challenges that our country will have to face – that of an ageing population due to high longevity and low birth rates: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item In Japan, the percentage of persons aged 65 years old and over exceeded 28.7\% of the total population as of 2020.
    \item The elderly population of Japan increased by 300,000 in 2020 from a year earlier. 
    \item A total of 36.17 million people above 65 years of age lived in Japan in 2020. [0.3 pause] 
\end{itemize}

The Japanese Government and business community seek to offset the effects of an ageing population on economic growth and government budget resources. The ageing population shapes demand and opportunities in various segments. Innovation in the field of medicine, such as our Peptide Discovery Platform System, also provides a great contribution to improving the living standards of our elderly population. The synthetically created macrocyclic peptides, with their high degree of specific binding, offer the opportunity to target protein surfaces traditionally considered “undruggable”. [0.3 pause] \\ 

\noindent Ladies and Gentlemen, \\
There is concern that the COVID-19 shock we are facing will remain for a long time as scarring effects. It is important to avoid such “scarring effects” on the economy as much as possible in order to create a situation where Japan's economy will return to a sustainable growth path without any sudden deceleration once the impact of COVID-19 subsides. Therefore, the top priority is to overcome the crisis as swiftly as possible. At the same time, it is also important to strengthen the growth potential while making the most of the lessons learned from this crisis. I am confident that this event will represent a major contribution to defining the strategy for the future of our country. \\
Thank you.
