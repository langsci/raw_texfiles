\BackBody{This book reconsiders the role of order and structure in syntax,
focusing on fundamental issues such as word order and grammatical
functions. The papers in the collection ask what word order can tell us
about syntactic structure, using evidence from V2, object shift, word
order gaps and different kinds of movement. All of the papers address in
some way the tension between modelling what can vary across languages
whilst improving our understanding of what might be universal to human
language.
% This book is complemented by \textit{Order and structure in syntax II: Subjecthood and argument structure}.
