\section{Vowels}\label{sec:2.1}
Tuatschin possesses nine \isi{vowels} which are presented in \tabref{vow}. Minimal pairs are listed in \tabref{vmp}.
\begin{table}
\caption{Vowels}
\label{vow}
 \begin{tabular}{lllll}

 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The reduced \isi{vowels} [ə] and [ɐ] only occur in unstressed syllables. There are no minimal pairs contrasting [ə] and [ɐ], and the distribution of these two reduced \isi{vowels} is not clear to me. It seems as if in certain cases a speaker may use [ə] or [ɐ] in the same environment; there is, however, a tendency for [ɐ] to occur in the neighbourhood of stressed [a], as in [ju ˈmaːvɐ] `I used to go', and for [ə] to occur in the environment of [e] or [ɛ], as in [ˈrwɛrəs] `Ruèras'. Because of this uncertainty, these two \isi{vowels} will not be differentiated and both will be represented by <a>, respectively by /ɐ/.

In contrast, [e] and [ɛ] generally occur in stressed syllables in non-compound words, but in some loanwords they may occur in unstressed syllables, as is the case of the second [ɛ] in /\textit{ˈgɛnɛral}/ `general (adj.)'.

There are long and short \isi{vowels} in Tuatschin, but minimal pairs contrasting long \isi{vowels} with short \isi{vowels} do not seem to exist. In unstressed syllables, only short \isi{vowels} occur, but in stressed syllables, there are both short and long \isi{vowels}. They will not be represented orthographically, but in the Tuatschin word list (chapter 9), all the lexical entries will be followed by a phonetic transcription indicating lengthening of the \isi{vowels}.

Regarding [ʊ] and [u], \citet[130]{Liver2010} notes for \ili{Standard Sursilvan} that [ʊ] mostly occurs in short syllables, whereas [u] mostly occurs in long syllables, with some exceptions. In Tuatschin, there is at least one minimal pair which opposes the two \isi{vowels} in a short syllable: /ʥu/ `had' (participle of \textit{vaj} 'have') vs /ʥʊ/ `down'. The realisation of /ʊ/ varies between a nearly closed [u] and a very closed [o].

In my corpus, the \isi{close front rounded} [y], represented by \textit{ü}, only occurs in recent loans from German or Swiss German. It is not included in \tabref{vow}. Examples are \textit{bürò} `office', \textit{mütòlògia} `mythology', and \textit{tüp} `person'.\footnote{The Sursilvan, \ili{Sutsilvan}, and \ili{Surmiran} varieties do not possess close-front and close-mid front rounded \isi{vowels} except in recent German loans, in contrast to the Ladin varieties (Putér, Vallader, and Jauer) which possess /y/ and /ø/, as in \textit{tü} `you (\textsc{sg})' or \textit{magöl} `glass'. In Sursilvan /ø/ also exists in recent German loans: \textit{töf} `motorbike', which is pronounced \textit{téf} by old people.}

\tabref{vmp} presents some minimal pairs contrasting short \isi{vowels} on the one hand, and contrasting long \isi{vowels} on the other.

\section{Diphthongs}\label{sec:2.2}
In Tuatschin, diphthongs consist of the \isi{glides} /j/ and /w/ as well as /i/ and /u/ in combination with /ə/. Tuatschin possesses five falling and ten rising diphthongs. \tabref{diph} shows the diphthongs with /j/ and /w/. Note that /ɔw/ is very rare and only occurs in the inverted forms of the first person singular \isi{present indicative} forms of /saˈvaj/ `know' and /vaj/ `have': /sɔw/ `know I' and /vɔw/ `have I'. The following diphthongs do not occur: /ɔj/, /ʊj/, /uj/, /jʊ/, /ɛj/, /ɛw/, /ew/, /iw/, /ʊw/, /uw/, /wɔ/, /wʊ/, and /wu/.

The falling \isi{diphthong} /uɐ/ is not very frequent. An example is  /ˈʃkuɐ/ `broom'.

Minimal pairs with diphthongs are rare in the corpus; there are only oppositions between /aj/ and /ej/, as in /najf/ `snow' vs /nejf/ `new', or /majl/ `apple' vs /mejl/ `honey'.

\begin{table}
\caption{Diphthongs}
	\label{diph}
	\begin{tabular}{llllll}

		/iw/ & -- & & /wi/ & /kwɛlˈwizɐ/ & `in this way'\\
		/ɔw/ & /sɔw/ & `know I' \\
		\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \isi{diphthong} /aj/ is pronounced [aj] or [æj].

The difference between diphthongs and \isi{vowels} in \isi{hiatus} is not always straightforward. A spontaneous production of /piun/ `lard' with /i/ and /u/ in \isi{hiatus} is found in (\ref{ex:lard}).

\ea\label{ex:lard}
\gll La mùm' ò méz ajn \textbf{piún}.\\
\textsc{def.f.sg} mother have.\textsc{prs.3sg} put.\textsc{ptcp.unm} into lard.\textsc{m.sg}\\
\glt `Mother added some lard.' (Sadrún, m5)
\z

But when asked whether \textit{piun} has one or two syllables, the consultant answered that it has only one syllable and pronounced it [pjun]. \citet[3f.]{Caduff1952} notes the same problem for the \isi{diphthong} /iɐ/, which is sometimes pronounced [jɛ] or [je]. An example from the corpus is \textit{sté̱diamajn} `diligently', which is pronounced [ˌʃtediaˈmajn], but which also could also be pronounced [ˌʃtedjaˈmajn].

However, there are uncontroversial cases of \isi{hiatus}, as e.g. /fuˈajna/ `fireplace', /uˈɔn/ `this year', or /uˈawt/ `forest', which are never pronounced /ˈfwajnɐ/, /wɔn/ or /wawt/, in contrast to \textit{uéstg} /wéʃʨ/ `bishop'.

Hiatus across word boundaries is usually avoided. There are two strategies. The first and generally used one is the elision of the last vowel of the first word if it is a weak vowel (\textit{ə} and \textit{ɐ}, both spelled <a>), as in \textit{Quaj \textbf{vèz' ò} uschéja} `This looks like that' instead of \textit{vèza ò}. Example (\ref{ex:sandhi1}) contains two examples of the weak vowel <a> which is elided (\textit{bigj' idéa} for \textit{bigja idéa} and \textit{stad' ajn} for \textit{stada ajn}), a well as one example of strong \isi{vowels} that do not trigger elision (\textit{ju èra}).

\ea
\label{ex:sandhi1}
\gll Núa ṣè quaj hòtè̱l? \textbf{Bigj'} \textbf{idéa}, \textbf{ju} \textbf{èra} schòn ònṣ bigja \textbf{stad’} \textbf{ajn} quaj martgau.   \\
where \textsc{cop.prs.3sg} \textsc{dem.m.sg} hotel \textsc{neg} idea \textsc{1sg} be.\textsc{impf.1sg} already year.\textsc{m.pl} \textsc{neg} \textsc{cop.ptcp.f.sg} in \textsc{dem.m.sg} city\\
\glt `Where is this hotel? No idea, I hadn't been in that city for years.' (Ruèras, f7,  \sectref{sec:8.14})
\z

The other, much less frequent strategy, is to insert an \isi{epenthetic  \textit{n}} between the two words as in (\ref{ex:euphonic1}), where \textit{n} is inserted between \textit{vasèva} and \textit{ins}.

\ea
\label{ex:euphonic1}
\gll    \textbf{Vasèva-n} \textbf{ins} ina signjura […] cun schuba cuérta, còtschna, […] lura spitgavan als purs ina grònda malaura […].\\
see.\textsc{impf.3sg-euph} \textsc{gnr} \textsc{indef.f.sg} woman {} with skirt.\textsc{f.sg} short red {} \textsc{corr} expect.\textsc{impf.3pl} \textsc{def.m.pl} farmer.\textsc{pl} \textsc{indef.f.sg} big storm\\
\glt `If one saw a woman with a short skirt, a red one, the farmers would expect a heavy storm.' (Sèlva, \citealt[34]{Büchli1966})
\z

This \isi{epenthetic \textit{n}} tends to be used in written \ili{Standard Sursilvan}; the more usual strategy would be elision like in \textit{vasèv' ins}.

 
\section{Consonants}\label{sec:2.3}
Tuatschin possesses 26 \isi{consonants} which are presented in \tabref{cons}; consonant minimal pairs are shown in \tabref{cmp}.

The four \isi{consonants} /h/, /x/, /ŋ/, and /ʣ/ have a restricted distribution and do not have a phonemic status.

\begin{itemize}
	\item /h/ and /x/ only exist in Swiss German loans like  /halt/ `simply' or /rex/ `rich'
	
	\item /ŋ/ is an allophone of /n/ before /ɡ/ and /k/
	
	\item /ʣ/ is an allophone of /ʦ/ in word final position if it is followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant. In the corpus it occurs in a few words like /lɛʣ/ vs /lɛʦ/ `\isi{anaphoric demonstrative}' and in /mjaʣˈde/ `noon (literally `half day')' vs /ˈmiaʦ/ `half \textsc{(m})'.
\end{itemize}

The other 21 \isi{consonants} do have a phonological status as can be seen in \tabref{cmp}.

/l/ and /r/ have different realisations according to the speaker. Some speakers pronounce /l/ as [ł] although its distribution is not yet clear, and the uvular /ʁ/ is not uncommon among younger speakers.

Furthermore, /r/ and /l/ may have a \isi{syllabic} realisation due to the dropping of [ɐ] between \isi{consonants} as  in
[pr̩] vs [pɐr] `for' (\sectref{sec:8.1}),
[ˌpr̩.mɐ.ˈvɛ.rɐ ]  vs [ˌpɐr.mɐ. ˈvɛ.rɐ] `spring' (\sectref{sec:8.16}),
[pr̩.vɐ.zɛ.dɐrs] vs  [pɐr̩.vɐ.zɛ.dɐrs] `herdsmen' (\sectref{sec:8.6}),
[tr̩] vs [tiɐr] `at, by' \sectref{sec:8.4}),
[pr̩.ˈsu.lɐ] vs [pɐr.ˈsu.lɐ] `alone (\textsc{f})' \sectref{sec:8.4})
[ʃtr̩.mɐn.ˈtus] vs [ʃtɐr. mɐn.ˈtus] `terrible' (\sectref{sec:8.2}) or
[pl̩s] vs [pɐr ɐls] `for the' \sectref{sec:8.7}).

The voiced stops /b/, /d/, and /ɡ/ are sometimes realised as \isi{voiceless consonants} like in [ˈab̥ər] `but'; however, this is never the case with the voiced palatal fricatives /z/ and /ʒ/.

\newpage
In rare cases, the \isi{voiceless} stops show an aspirated realisation, as in [əmˈpʰaw] `a bit' (\sectref{sec:8.4}) or [pʰas] `pass' (\sectref{sec:8.7}).

There are some cases of assimilation of \isi{consonants} across word boundaries. In (\ref{ex:ass1}), \textit{détg di} `said to' is realised as [detːi], and in (\ref{ex:ass2}), \textit{détg: té} `said: you' is pronounced [detːe].


\ea\label{ex:ass1}
\gll [...] api vau \textbf{détg} \textbf{di} mùma [...].\\
{} and have.\textsc{prs.1sg.1sg} say.\textsc{ptcp.unm} \textsc{def.dat} mother\\
\glt `[...] I said to my mother [...].' (Sadrún, m4,   \sectref{sec:8.3})
\z

\ea\label{ex:ass2}
\gll Pi ò èla \textbf{détg}: «\textbf{Té} savèssaṣ í cul tat [...].\\
then have.\textsc{prs.3sg} \textsc{3sg} say.\textsc{ptcp.unm} \textsc{2sg} can.\textsc{cond.2sg} go.\textsc{inf}  with.\textsc{def.m.sg} grandfather\\
\glt `Then she said: “You could go up with your grandfather [...].' (m4,  \sectref{sec:8.3})
\z

There are also some cases where complex \isi{consonant clusters} are avoided, like for instance [ʨs], which is sometimes pronounced [ʦ] like in [maʦ] instead of [maʨs] `bunches' (\sectref{sec:8.11}).

In rapid speech /ʨ/ may be realised as an unreleased consonant, yielding a sound that is close to the glide /j/. Examples are \textit{létg/léj} `bed'  (\sectref{sec:8.3}), \textit{hanlétg/hanléj} `business' (\sectref{sec:8.9}), or \textit{atgnamajn/ajnamajn} `actually' (\sectref{sec:8.16}).

A major problem in analysing \isi{consonants} is the question whether the \isi{voiceless} word final \isi{consonants} should be considered as such or as underlyingly voiced. For instance, in \ili{Standard Sursilvan} the 1st person singular \isi{conditional} is written \textit{cantass} `I would sing', but in Tuatschin when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, it is pronounced /z/, as in \textit{stèṣ} /ʃtɛz/ (\ref{ex:stes}).

\ea\label{ex:stes}
\gll [...] álṣò sch' ju \textit{\textbf{stèṣ}} aun fá in' jèda quaj, \textit{\textbf{figès}} ju bétga.\\
{} well if \textsc{1sg} must.\textsc{cond.1sg} still do.\textsc{inf} one.\textsc{f.sg} time \textsc{dem.unm} do.\textsc{cond.1sg} \textsc{1sg} \textsc{neg}\\
\glt `[...] well, if I had to do it once more, I wouldn't do it.' (Sadrún, m10, \sectref{sec:8.7})
\z

Other examples are `not even' and `eight'. `Not even' is spelled \textit{gnanc} in \ili{Standard Sursilvan}, but in Tuatschin it is pronounced with [ɡ] instead of [k] if it is followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, like in /ɲaŋg in/ `not even one'. `Eight' is a similar case since it is spelled \textit{otg} in \ili{Standard Sursilvan}, but if it is followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant it is pronounced [ɔʥ] like in [ɔʥ ɔns] `eight years' (\sectref{sec:8.15}). However, in \textit{òtgònta} `eighty' \textit{òtg} is pronounced [ɔʨ] and not [ɔʥ]. 

If all final \isi{voiceless consonants} were pronounced voiced when followed by a voiced element, it would be very easy to establish the rule that every \isi{voiceless} consonant in word final position is pronounced voiced if followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant. However, this is not the case. In [in brˈiɐk əd in kʊp] `a wooden bucket and a bowl' /k/ is never pronounced [ɡ]: [in *brˈiɐɡ əd in kʊp].  The same holds for \textit{ljuc} `place': [in ʎuk ˌɐmpɐrˈnajval] `a cosy place' vs [in *ʎuɡ ˌɐmpɐrˈnajval]. A further example is [fjuk] `fire' whose \isi{diminutive} is [fjuˈkɛt] and not [*fjuˈɡɛt].

Therefore I will deviate from the \ili{Standard Sursilvan} spelling and write voiced \isi{consonants} in case they are pronounced voiced when followed by a voiced element, and the rule will be formulated as follows:

\begin{quote}
Every word final voiced consonant is pronounced as \isi{voiceless} in isolation or preceding a word starting with a \isi{voiceless} consonant, whereby \textit{j}, \textit{m}, and \textit{n} behave like \isi{voiceless consonants}.
\end{quote}

That the nasals behave like \isi{voiceless consonants} is demonstrated by the opposition between \textit{gjuvan} /ˈʥuvɐn/ `young (\textsc{m.sg})' vs \textit{gjufna} /ˈʥufnɐ/ `young (\textsc{f.sg})'.

The consequences for the \isi{spelling system} used in this book will be discussed in \sectref{sec:2.5}.


\section{Syllable structure}\label{sec:2.4}
Tuatschin possesses open and closed syllables, short and long. Long syllables (represented by VV in the table below) are realised by long \isi{vowels} as well as by diphthongs. Consonant clusters occur in onset and coda position in a restricted way. The combination of two \isi{consonants} in onset position is realised by a voiced or \isi{voiceless} stop and /l/ or /r/; three \isi{consonants} in onset position correspond to the same combinations but preceded by /ʃ/. In coda position, only two \isi{consonants} occur (/rɛʃt/ `leftover'), but if the plural suffix \mbox{\textit{-s}} is added, three syllables also occur (/rɛʃts/ `leftovers'). Some syllable types are presented in \tabref{syllt}.

 Tuatschin possesses words of one, two, and three syllables. Words with four or five syllables are rare and are usually compound words (/ʥu.vɐn.ˈteʨ.nɐ/ `youth' or /ˌɔː.rɐ.ʥʊ.ˈzʊt/ `underneath in direction down the valley'). More examples of polysyllabic words are to be found in \tabref{syllt}.
 	
 	Stress is fixed and can be placed on the ultimate (/ɐn.ˈtʊrn/ `around' or /ɐn.ʦɐr. ˈdaː/ `aerate the soil'), the penultimate (/mu.ˈvɐl/ `cattle'), or the ante-penultimate syllable, which is rare (/ʦɐ.ˈɡrin.dɐ.rɐ/ `Yenish woman').

An in-depth analysis of stress, especially of the distribution of secondary stress, must be left to further studies.



\section{Spelling system}\label{sec:2.5}
The \isi{spelling system} used in this grammar is a compromise between \ili{Standard Sursilvan} spelling and the aim of making pronunciation and word stress transparent to the reader, which means that one grapheme has to correspond to one sound (or phoneme in most cases) (see \tabref{graphIpaI} and \tabref{graphIpaII}). 

The problems that \ili{Standard Sursilvan} spelling does not solve are

\begin{itemize}
\item whether <e> and <o> are close-mid or mid, 
\item whether two adjacent \isi{vowels} form a rising or falling \isi{diphthong} or whether they represent two \isi{vowels} in \isi{hiatus},
\item whether <s> and <sch> are voiced or not, 
\item and, in some cases, on which syllable of a given word stress falls.
\end{itemize}
 
To disambiguate these problems, I will indicate with an acute accent <é, ó> that the vowel is close-mid, and with a grave accent that the vowel is mid (<è, ò>) or near close (<ù>). Voiced palatal fricatives get a dot under the \textit{s} (<ṣ> for /z/ and <ṣch> for /ʒ/), as is the usage in Romansh bilingual dictionaries. The other cases will be explained below.

Stress rules are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Diphthongs are always stressed (\textit{autar} /ˈawtɐr/ `other').
	\item Words without a \isi{diphthong} which end in a vowel or <-n> or <-s> are stressed on the penultimate syllable (\textit{tata} /ˈtatɐ/ `grandmother', \textit{anzjaman} /ɐnˈʦjamɐn/ `together', \textit{casas} /ˈkazɐs/ `houses').
	\item Words without a \isi{diphthong} ending in a consonant, except for words ending in <-n> or <-s>, are stressed on the last syllable (\textit{racrut} /rakˈrut/ `recruit').
	\item Mid and close-mid \isi{vowels} (<é, è, ó, ò>) are stressed except if they occur in a word containing a \isi{diphthong}.
	\item Words ending in a vowel or <n> or <s> which are stressed on a syllable other than the penultimate get an acute accent. This concerns the \isi{vowels} \textit{a}, \textit{i}, and \textit{u}. In other words, \textit{á}, \textit{í}, and \textit{ú} are always stressed (\textit{cantá} /kɐnˈtaː/ `sing', \textit{barcún} /bɐrˈkun/ `shutter', \textit{barbís} /bɐrˈbiːs/ `moustache', \textit{fugí} /fuˈʥiː/ `flee').
	\item Words with two diphthongs, with two \isi{vowels} with diacritics, or with a \isi{diphthong} and a vowel with a diacritic, get an underscore under the stressed vowel or \isi{diphthong} (\textit{èxtrè̱m} /ɛksˈtrɛːm/ `extreme', \textit{gròndè̱zja} /grɔnˈdɛzjɐ/ `size').
	\item Other cases of stressed \isi{vowels} which are not covered by the preceding rules also get an underscore, as for example \textit{mè̱ndar} /ˈmɛndɐr/ `worse', \textit{anavù̱s} /ɐnɐˈvʊːs/ `back, backward', \textit{antù̱rn} /ɐnˈtʊrn/ `around'.
\end{itemize}


The reason for giving <n> and <s> special treatment is the fact that <n> is used for verbal plural and <s> for nominal and verbal plural. If <n> and <s> were treated like the other final \isi{consonants}, many more diacritics would be used.

A further problem is the treatment of <s> followed by a consonant. Here, I follow the \ili{Standard Sursilvan} spelling:

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item <s> followed by <c\footnote{Before \isi{consonants} as well as before \isi{vowels} other than \textit{e} and \textit{i}.}, f, m, n, p, qu, r, t> is pronounced [ʃ].
	\item <s> followed by <b, d, g, v> is written <ṣ> and pronounced [ʒ].
	\item <s> followed by <c\footnote{Before \textit{e} or \textit{i}.}, l, n, z is pronounced [s].
	\item If <s> should not be pronounced [ʃ] or [ʒ], a hyphen separates the two \isi{consonants} as in <cuns-cianza> (/kunsˈʦiɐnʦɐ/) `conscience', <ris-plí> (/risˈpli/) `pencil', or <mjɐdṣ-dé/mjɐṣ-ˈdé> (/mjɐdz-de, mjɐz-de) `noon'. A hyphen is also used to separate <g> from <j> in order to prevent this combination from being pronounced /ʥ/, as e.g. in \textit{nag-janta} `(s)he drowns'.
\end{itemize}

In the texts (\chapref{sec:8}) and hence also in the examples taken from these texts, the final \isi{consonants} are transcribed as they are pronounced. An example is the word for `ten', which can be transcribed [déjʃ] or [déjʒ] according to the context in which it occurs.

\tabref{graphIpaI} and \tabref{graphIpaII} present the correspondences between the spelling used in this grammar and the IPA phonetic alphabet.




Furthermore, the following orthographic signs are used to indicate elided \isi{vowels}: <'> for \isi{vowels} elided at the end of a word, as in \textit{l'agid} `the help' (instead of \textit{l\textbf{a} agid}), and <`> for \isi{vowels} elided at the beginning of a word, as in \textit{ò `l détg} `has he said' (instead of \textit{ò \textbf{è}l détg}).
