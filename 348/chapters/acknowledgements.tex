For her invaluable advice, patience and feedback, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Univ-Prof. Dr. Silvia Hansen-Schirra.

This endeavour would not have been possible without the students who participated in the experiments, my speaker, and the helping hand of the Tra\&Co research team. 

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my mentor, Dr. Claudio Fantinuoli, for inspiring and supporting me throughout my research journey.

Finally, my heartfelt thanks goes to my parents Anna and Claudio, my sister Francesca, my partner Marek and all my friends, in particular Francesca and Elisa, for their unwavering support over the years.
