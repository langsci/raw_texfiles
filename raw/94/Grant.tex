\section{Introduction}

 
Robert Rankin's examinations of earlier sources on Native American languages which have rarely been the subject of fuller description impel us to look at the work of other early collectors of data on Siouan and Caddoan languages. We may mention for instance his paper on Max von Wied's \citeyearpar{Maximilian18391841} brief vocabulary of Kaw, \ili{Kanza} or Kansa  (\citealt{Rankin1994}), Nor should we overlook his splendid salvage work on \ili{Kanza} (the name I will use henceforth in this paper) and \ili{Quapaw}, and his pivotal role in the organization of the Siouan-Caddoan Conferences\is{Siouan and Caddoan Linguistics Conference}.
 

One researcher is almost overlooked nowadays (despite a memoir by \citealt{Lesley1881} which hymns his activities while getting its dedicatee's name wrong). The naturalist, sawmill manager and avocational linguist Samuel Stehman Haldeman (1812--1880)  was mostly known to the linguists in the 19\textsuperscript{th} century for his `Analytic Orthography' (\citealt{Haldeman1859}, also produced in book form as \citealt{Haldeman1860}). This was a prizewinning attempt to construct a  universal \is{orthography}phonetic alphabet, based on \ili{Latin} letters (and following some precepts of classical Ciceronian \ili{Latin} pronunciation, for instance <C> for /k/ and <V> for /w/) but enhanced with some created symbols. It also added a number of \isi{diacritics}, for documenting\is{language documentation} phonetic data in the world's languages, especially from previously undescribed languages of North America and elsewhere.

This work represented a determined effort to describe and notate
sounds of speech, for which it was awarded the Trevyllian Prize in London against eighteen contenders. And there its reception ground to a halt. The alphabetic system, based on what Haldeman assumed were Classical \ili{Latin} letter-values, was well-adapted to indicate certain aspects of vowel quality and quantity and basic consonantal distinctions. But his pioneering work is one of several such pre-International Phonetic Association  schemes proposed in the 19\textsuperscript{th} century, of which \citet{Lepsius1863} is the most famous and influential, and it is cumbrous.  Because it required a large number of special fonts and \isi{diacritics} it was difficult to reproduce, with the result that nobody save Haldeman ever adopted it.    

Haldeman's system is elaborate but just how successfully or consistently he applied his own transcriptional\is{transcription} system is moot. For instance in his \ili{Chinese} data (actually \ili{Cantonese}), he fails to indicate any tones for the numerals for Guangzhou \ili{Cantonese}, although he makes an effort to do so for  the nearby Macanese variety of \ili{Cantonese}.  Haldeman uses the phonetic terminology of his time, with \textit{surd, sonant, lenis, asper}, employed where modern phoneticians talk about \textit{voiceless, voiced, unaspirated\is{simple stops}} and \textit{aspirated} sounds, and with \textit{sigmal, lingual, cerebral, guttural} and \textit{faucal} used for modern \textit{alveolar, dental, retroflex, velar} and \textit{uvular} respectively. He also talks about ``pure'' (non-nasalized) and  nasal  sounds\is{nasalization}, and arrays consonants according to their degree of ``interruption'' (plosives are the most ``interrupted'' consonants in this scheme); see \figref{haldemandigest}. He also divided consonants into \textit{mutes} (plosives and nasals) and \textit{\isi{liquid}s} (other consonants).  \citet[83, 369]{Haldeman1860} recognizes thirty-four vowel qualities, which he arranges in a dense A-shaped diagram, and he indicates vowel quantity with macrons and breves. Unlike Daniel Jones \citeyearpar{Jones1909} he does not propose a scheme in which the distinction between back [ɑ] and front [a] is crucial.

The concentration in this work is on Haldeman's \ili{Dhegiha}-language data, although observations from his work on \ili{Caddo} and \ili{Wichita} will be added where relevant. (Unfortunately I lack sufficient modern lexical data to give as full an analysis with modern examples of the \ili{Caddo} and \ili{Wichita} data as I would wish.)   Data from Haldeman's work are taken from \citet{Haldeman1860}, a corrected and book-length edition of \citet{Haldeman1859}.  Haldeman divided his work into sections (often extremely short and usually corresponding to paragraphs), in addition to the book being paginated.  Both modes of reference will be used here.  

\section{Haldeman the Americanist and his work on Dhegiha}  

 \largerpage[-1]
In addition to a number of versions of the Lord's Prayer (including those in \ili{Cherokee} and \ili{Wyandot}) \citet{Haldeman1860}  provided data in the form of 75 cardinal numeral sets from 1--10 from a wide range of languages of Europe, Asia and North America (plus \ili{Grebo} from Liberia).  A number of these were \ili{Algonquian}, \ili{Muskogean} and \ili{Iroquoian} languages in addition to numerals from \ili{Makah}, \ili{Chinook}, \ili{Comanche}, \ili{Jicarilla Apache}\il{Apache} and the \ili{Yuman} language \il{Diegue\~no}'Iipay Aa. Among the languages on which Haldeman tried out his \is{orthography}spelling system are the \ili{Dhegiha} Siouan language \ili{Kanza} (for which he also provided some \ili{Santee} parallels for certain forms from \citealt{Riggs1852}; see Figure 3).  He also provided data from the \ili{Caddoan} languages \ili{Caddo} (which Haldeman referred to as ``Nadaco'') and \ili{Wichita} (referred to as ``Waco'' but identical with the \ili{Wichita} recorded in the 20\textsuperscript{th} and 21\textsuperscript{st} centuries, for instance in \citet{Rood1975}. In each case the data presented are cardinal numerals from 1--10 and some additional lexicon (over 40 such items in the case of \ili{Caddo} and 10 from \ili{Wichita}), evidently recorded by Haldeman from native speakers and not previously listed elsewhere. Haldeman also collected the numerals from 1--10 in \ili{Osage}; see Figures \ref{haldemannumerals} and \ref{haldemanlexicon}.

\end{figure}

As \citet{Rankin1994} showed, Max von Wied \citep{Maximilian18391841} had described sounds in various \ili{Dhegiha} languages (Wied documented\is{language documentation} \ili{Omaha}, \ili{Ponca}, \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage}) quite well within the limitations of his annotated Franco-\ili{German} \is{orthography}spelling system. This means that though his work is superb for its time he missed many crucial details and failed to record other details consistently.   Haldeman's system was theoretically more precise as far as it went (although there is little consistent coverage of tones and essentially none of consonants which are ingressive, velaric, or other kinds of clicks). But it was deployed less consistently and less accurately.   His records of \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage} do show an ability to indicate primary \isi{stress} using acute accents, while grave accents are used to indicate a variety of vowel qualities, short vowels are marked with breves, long vowels with postvocalic dots, and vowel \isi{nasalization} is represented with the ogonek or Polish hook placed at the bottom of the line after the vowel.  
 

Working on small amounts of material (often only the numerals from 1--10) from a large number of languages, Haldeman recognized that some sounds were problematic in terms of his descriptive criteria, as his discussion of the two \isi{ejective}s  \ili{Caddo} /t'/ and \ili{Wichita} /k'/ shows (\citealt[99: \S448; 131: \S574]{Haldeman1860}).  But he did not make the leap (as \citealt{Garcia1760} had done for \ili{Coahuilteco}) by discovering that what made these sounds distinctive from other speech sounds but similar to one another was their common possession of \isi{ejective} quality, with the corollary that ejectives should be represented consistently.  As a result he was unable to indicate the \isi{ejective} quality of the final consonant in \ili{Caddo} \textit{wists'i} `one'.  In fact, Haldeman's attempts at transcribing\is{transcription} \ili{Caddo} (for instance Haldeman's <v\'{ɑ}tɐt'> for \textit{waadat} `earth', in which he fails to hear that the medial stop is voiced: \citealt[135, \S633]{Haldeman1860}) are scattershot enough to be unreliable. Even so he recognized that the \ili{Caddo} word for `cheek'  used a dental or alveolar rather than a velar nasal.    

 
His array of consonantal types was defective in other respects. Although \ili{Dhegiha} languages contain \isi{ejective}s, the small samples from \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage} which Haldeman cites happen not to include any of these sounds; Haldeman would probably have been unable to indicate these, as they are not provided for in his consonantal chart, and his encounters with them in \ili{Caddo} and \ili{Wichita} left him uncertain as to the nature and phonetic structure of the \isi{ejective}s which he encountered there.  He also lacked a consistent way of indicating the \isi{glottal} stop, either initially, medially or finally, which is a special problem when recording \ili{Caddo} data. Nor did Haldeman's system capture the three degrees of phonemic \isi{vowel length} which are present in \ili{Wichita} (although \citealt[80, \S353--355]{Haldeman1860}) provides the wherewithal to do this.  
 

As a result of these and other shortcomings, Haldeman's work has received rather little attention from modern phonologists or indeed other linguists.  Even Haldeman himself made no use of the system in his work on \ili{Pennsylvania German}\il{German} (\citealt{Haldeman1872}).  The discussion in \citet{Pilling1887} and the brief account in \citet{KellyLocal1989}, written incidentally by the academics who taught phonetics to this author, are  rare exceptions to this neglect.   

 
Haldeman's data on \ili{Osage}, comprising merely the cardinal numerals from 1 through 10, and the corresponding forms in \ili{Kanza}, help us to get a better sense of his transcriptional\is{transcription} techniques. Modern \ili{Osage} data are from \citet{Quintero2009} and \ili{Kanza} data from \citet{CumberlandRankin2012}.  Original transcriptional systems have been preserved. We note that the two languages, though very close, are represented differently in regard to orthographic conventions employed to indicate postalveolar sibilants, \isi{vowel length} and nasalized\is{nasalization} vowels. 
 

\ili{Dhegiha} languages share a number of crosslinguistically marked features in their segmental \isi{phonology}.  These include the differentiation of nasalised from oral vowels, the differentiation of \isi{geminate} and lengthened stops, of preaspirated\is{preaspirate stops} and voiceless \isi{ejective} stops, and the use of a high front rounded vowel. Modern forms are given below (Kansa\il{Kanza} <u> is /y/ and superscript <n> represents \isi{nasalization}, indicated in \ili{Osage} by an ogonek).


\section{Modern counterparts of the data}
 
In Tables \ref{numerals} and \ref{additionallexicon} are given modern equivalents in \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage} for Haldeman's data in Figures 2 and 3.

Note that what are written as single plosives in the modern \ili{Kanza} \isi{orthography} are actually \isi{geminate}s, thus <k> is /kk/.  

\section{Remarks on the forms}
The materials here represent examples of impressionistic phonetic transcriptions\is{transcription}, which is what we would expect in a work from the pre-phonemic era.  The \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage} words in Haldeman's material (especially the former) are recorded with comparatively greater detail than numerical data from some of the other languages are.  Indeed the \ili{Kanza} numerals are recorded with greater detail by Haldeman with respect to accent than they are in the present \isi{orthography}.  But the forms are not necessarily noted with greater accuracy, and neither system indicates the differences between the various voiceless stop series clearly.   Tense stops in \ili{Kanza} in Haldeman's \isi{transcription} are represented by the use of bold consonantal characters, so that  Haldeman's <p> is [p $\sim$ ph], <\textbf{p}> is [pp] while <`p> is [hp] in his \ili{Kanza} work. (This fact is clearer in the version of Haldeman's work published in the \textit{Transactions of the American Philosophical Society} than in the acid-heavy and aged brown paper of the version of \citealt{Haldeman1860} available from archive.org.)  
 

The forms are in general readily identifiable from recording of the languages over a century later, as the references from the \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage} dictionaries show (\citealt{CumberlandRankin2012} for \ili{Kanza}, and \citealt{Quintero2009} for \ili{Osage}). The few differences are instructive.    

 
Most interesting in this regard are the numerals, especially `nine' and `ten'.  In \ili{Osage} `nine' is a subtractive \isi{compound} (`ten lacking one') involving `ten' and an allomorph of `one'.  But  \ili{Kanza} uses the widespread form, possibly reconstructible as \textit{ki\v{s}\k{a}kka}, which is recorded for several Mississippi Valley\il{Mississippi Valley Siouan} and Ohio Valley Siouan\il{Southeastern Siouan}, \ili{Muskogean} and Great Lakes \ili{Algonquian} languages.   Modern \ili{Osage} has simplified the onset of `ten', though Haldeman had what would nowadays be represented as /kar-/ (or maybe /gar-/; his depiction of voicing is not always trustworthy).  The form in \ili{Dhegiha} has irregular reflexes elsewhere in \ili{Dhegiha}:   \ili{Omaha-Ponca} \textit{gthéba},\footnote{\url{http://omahalanguage.unl.edu/dictionary/}} where <th> is /ð/, has lost the \isi{liquid} found in the second syllable in other \ili{Dhegiha} languages and in earlier records of \ili{Omaha-Ponca} (compare \ili{Quapaw} \textit{kdébn\k{a}}; \citealt[3]{Rankin1982}). The glide which separates the prefix from the form for `three' in \ili{Kanza} `eight' has been apprehended by Haldeman as a front vowel, although the hiatus in the corresponding \ili{Osage} form has been recognized by Haldeman as such.  

Both the \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage} forms in Haldeman's work include forms of what was originally the enclitic \textit{-xci} `only' at the end of the form for ONE, and this pan-\ili{Dhegiha} word is a form which was later borrowed into \ili{Caddo} as \textit{wists'i'}.  Note also the initial [di-] in \ili{Kanza} `three', now replaced by /j-/ <y->, and the fact that Haldeman did not notice the \isi{nasalization} of the vowel in the first syllable of \ili{Kanza} `two'.  The form `eight' in Haldeman's \ili{Osage} is reflected in the modern language, in modern \ili{Kanza} and (as a loan\is{borrowing}, namely \textit{kiy\'ataw}; \citealt{Rood1996}:608) in modern \ili{Wichita}. But the earlier form for `eight' based on `three' is used in Haldeman's \ili{Kanza} as a parallel to the form for `seven' (itself a \isi{compound} involving `two'). Primary \isi{stress} and \isi{vowel length} and \isi{nasalization} are well represented in Haldeman's work, especially for \ili{Osage}.  
 

Of the nouns in Haldeman's record of \ili{Kanza}, most are similar to their modern counterparts.  For the rest, if one allows for a modicum of close phonetic detail (for instance the realization of /a/ as a low rounded vowel in `nose'), the quality of \isi{transcription} is rather high. `Eyebrow' may end in a form of \textit{s\'abe} `black' but this is uncertain, while material which is less easy to identify is attached to the end of `eye' and `shirt'.  The occasional weakness in Haldeman's powers of perception is seen in the fact that the consonantal sounds in the second part of `nostril' are represented in Haldeman's work by his symbol for /ʃ/, while the initial consonant of `tongue' has changed in the 120 or so years between Haldeman's work and Bob Rankin's.  `Warm' seems to include an enclitic, which may be the masculine declarative enclitic \textit{(ey)ao}.  Haldeman's remarks about the phonetics of `nose' and `tongue' are somewhat surprising, as modern \ili{Kanza} does not permit [h] in \isi{coda position} and does not use \isi{geminate} consonants.


\section{Conclusion}
 
Data on Haldeman's recording of \ili{Dhegiha} languages have been presented and the success or otherwise of Haldeman's system in coping with the segmental \isi{phonology} of these languages, especially the complex consonantal systems, has been evaluated. Haldeman's ability correctly to hear the phonetic features of a language seems to have varied in competence from one language to another.  Although his \ili{Kanza} and \ili{Osage} data are the most accurately recorded \ili{Dhegiha} data of their time (and although very little else was available for \ili{Kanza} when Haldeman's data appeared), his \isi{transcription} is still far from adequate.  This is possibly the result of his imperception of certain sounds.  Nonetheless the transcriptions list some forms which differ in phonological shape or sense from the modern forms of these words, and as such they have some historical significance.
