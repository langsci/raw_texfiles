\addchap{Acknowledgments}

This book is a revised version of a doctoral dissertation written at the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München) that was defended in February 2017. It was made possible through the support of the Graduate School Language \& Literature Munich and especially the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes.

I would like to express my gratitude to Lindsay J. Whaley for making available to me a conference presentation on \ili{Oroqen} that was relevant for this study, to Benjamin Brosig for his invaluable comments on the chapter on \ili{Mongolic} languages, to Andrej Malchukov for some data on the language \ili{Even}, to András Róna-Tas for discussing some of my thoughts on \ili{Alchuka} \textit{k-}, to Bernard Comrie, not only for commenting on my typology of \isi{questions} but also for providing several studies on the languages of \isi{Siberia}, to Michael Cysouw for allowing the use of his coceptual space of interrogatives, to Erika Sandmann for sending valuable data and explanations on the language \ili{Wutun}, to Patryk Czerwinski for eliciting some examples from the last speakers of \ili{Uilta}, to Peter-Arnold Mumm for pointing out shortcomings in the \isi{conceptual space} of \isi{question marking}, to Stefan Georg for providing information on \ili{Ket} and some \ili{Mongolic} languages, to Marek Stachowski for a brief discussion of details of \ili{Turkic} interrogatives, and, finally, to Kathleen Rabl for going through my \ili{English}. I also want to thank my informants of \ili{Japanese}, Kalmyk, \ili{Khakas}, \ili{Khalkha} Mongolian, \ili{Korean}, \ili{Mandarin}, \ili{Russian}, and Xining \ili{Mandarin}. Needless to say, all the remaining shortcomings are mine. I also want to express my gratitude to Elena Skribnik and especially to Wolfgang Schulze and Hans van Ess for their constant support. Finally, I wish to extend my warmest thanks to Yadi Wu for always being there when I needed help most. Last but not least I would like to thank Martin Haspelmath, Sebastian Nordhoff, the anonymous reviewers, and the proofreaders working for Language Science Press.
