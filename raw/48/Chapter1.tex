This essay explores some conceptual foundations for understanding the causal mechanisms that determine why languages are the way they are. The motivation is outlined in Chapter \ref{causalunits}, below. At the core of the argument are three ideas. 

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item[] 
The first idea is that causal processes apply in multiple frames or \textquoteleft time scalesâ€™ simultaneously, and we need to understand and address each and all of these frames equally in our work on language. This is the topic of Chapter \ref{causaldynamics}. 

%\item[] 
This leads to the second idea: For culture (including language) to exist, its constituent parts must have successfully been diffused and kept in circulation in the social histories of human populations, a process that relies on convergent processes in multiple causal frames, and that depends most centrally on the micro-level social behavior of people in interaction. This is the topic of Chapter \ref{Transmission biases}. 

%\item[] 
The third idea, building on this, is that the socially-diffusing parts of language and culture are not just floating around, but are firmly integrated within larger systems, and so we must have a causal account of how mobile bits of knowledge and behavior form up into structured cultural systems such as languages. This is the topic of Chapter \ref{itemsystemproblem} (where the problem is articulated) and Chapter \ref{micromacrosolution} (where a solution is offered). 

%\end{enumerate}
In exploring these core ideas, this essay suggests a conceptual framework for explaining, in causal terms, what language is like and why it is like that. While methods of research on language keep changing, the underlying conceptual work---always independent from the methods being applied---must provide the foundation.
