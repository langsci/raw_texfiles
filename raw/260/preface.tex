\addchap{Preface}

\textit{Advances in Formal Slavic Linguistics 2017} is a collection of fifteen articles on formal Slavic linguistics. The articles cover a wide array of topics, such as control verbs, instrumental arguments, and perduratives in Russian, comparatives, negation, n-words, negative polarity items, and complementizer ellipsis in Czech, impersonal \textit{se}-constructions and complementizer doubling in Slovenian, prosody and the morphology of multi-purpose suffixes in Serbo-Croatian, and indefinite numerals and the binding properties of dative arguments in Polish. By exploring these phenomena in individual Slavic languages, the collection of articles in this volume makes a significant contribution to both Slavic linguistics and to linguistics in general.

The articles in this volume were prepared on the basis of talks and posters presented at the conference Formal Description of Slavic Languages 12.5, which was held on December 7-9, 2017, at the University of Nova Gorica. FDSL was initially a biannual conference, hosted in turn by the University of Leipzig and University of Potsdam since 1995, with the University of Göttingen joining the main conference cycle in 2011 and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in 2016. In 2006 FDSL was partly turned into an annual event when the University of Nova Gorica hosted FDSL 6.5. Eleven years later, after successful stops in Moscow in 2008 and Brno in 2010 and 2014, the 12.5 conference thus brought FDSL back to Nova Gorica, the place of its first halftime edition. The 18 regular-session talks and 10 poster presentations given at FDSL 12.5 were selected out of 47 submitted abstracts. The conference also featured 5 invited talks. Following the conference, 17 articles were submitted for inclusion in this volume, and 15 successfully completed the two-round review process in which every article was evaluated and commented on twice by two reviewers.
