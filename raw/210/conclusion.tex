\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch.conclusion}

Although this study primarily set out to explore the role of \isi{salience} in \isi{exemplar} \isi{priming} it has also produced a number of related results, which are nonetheless interesting.
The claim that younger Scousers' speech is noticeably more local \parencite[cf.][]{watson2007a} could be confirmed, but only for the two salient\is{salience} variables in the sample (\textsc{nurse}-\textsc{square} and lenition), which appear to carry considerable amounts of covert \isi{prestige}.
Local variants of non-salient\is{salience} variables, on the other hand, were actually found to be receding.
Young Liverpudlians seem to be somewhat more willing to express a local \isi{identity} linguistically than older ones, but they rely almost exclusively on highly salient\is{salience} and/or stigmatise\is{stigmatisation}d features for doing so.

Linguistic norms and \isi{attitude}s in the \isi{speech community} have remained relatively stable.
Speakers of all three generations investigated generally like ``soft'' or light Liverpool accents, but largely reject very strong ones, to a not inconsiderable degree because the latter are perceived as exaggerated and artificial\is{plastic Scouse(r)}.
Despite these similarities the presence of hypercorrect\is{hypercorrection}ion particularly in the middle-aged speakers suggests that this group is most sensitive to the negative \isi{image} of Liverpool and Scouse, probably because economic decline and \isi{stigmatisation} of the city were at its historic height in the 1970's and 80's when these speakers were growing up.

The phonological variables investigated are not equally salient\is{salience} in all three age groups.
For happ\textsc{y}-tensing and velar nasal plus there is essentially no \isi{change}, both variables are largely below the radar for all speakers in the sample.
With respect to the \textsc{nurse}-\textsc{square} merger, however, conscious\is{awareness} and sub-conscious\is{awareness} awareness declines from the middle to the young generation, while lenition of /k/ sees a steady and linear increase in \isi{salience} from the oldest to the youngest speakers.
Crucially, however, lenition of /k/ is the most salient\is{salience} feature in \emph{all} age groups, and is universally followed by the \textsc{nurse}-\textsc{square} merger, velar nasal plus, and happ\textsc{y}-tensing.
While speakers of different age groups have thus not the same level of awareness of the individual variables, the relative ordering is the same in all three generations.

\newpage 
This ordering is then mirrored in the perception data.
Both accuracy of ``correct'' token selection and statistical robustness of the \isi{priming} effect correlate with the social \isi{salience} of the test variable.
No effect at all is detectable for happ\textsc{y}-tensing, and only a weak one for velar nasal plus (if participant as a random factor is not taken into account).
The \textsc{nurse}-\textsc{square} merger and /k/ lenition, on the other hand, both generate robust \isi{priming} effects, and for the latter \isi{salience} can even explain differences between sub-groups of stimuli (divided by phonological environment\is{phonological context}) or subjects (middle- vs. working-class background).
The main hypothesis that this study was built on could thus be confirmed: The more socially salient\is{salience} a linguistic variable is, the more pronounced the resulting effect in an \isi{exemplar} \isi{priming} experiment will be; below a certain level of sub-conscious\is{awareness} aware\is{awareness}ness no statistically significant \isi{priming} effects are generated.

Intriguingly, all significant effects in the perception experiment are in the unexpected direction: Subjects who have been led to believe that the speaker is from Liverpool are \emph{less} likely to perceive variants typical of Liverpool English.
While it is seemingly at odds with existing \isi{priming} research in sociolinguistics, this result is actually compatible with previous work in psychology and suggests that the \isi{phonetic distance} between the prime\is{priming} and the actual speech signal is too great for perceivers to include the stimulus in the prime\is{priming}d category.
Priming\is{priming} works nevertheless, but the outcome is a \isi{contrast effect} instead of the \isi{assimilation effect}s that were found in the studies conducted in Detroit and New Zealand.

Another unexpected outcome of the perception test is that \isi{frequency} of the carrier word is not really a factor worth mentioning when it comes to predicting how subjects will perceive the stimulus.
In Chapter \ref{ch.sal} I did argue that \isi{frequency} of \emph{remembrance\is{memory structure}} and not \isi{frequency} of \emph{occurrence} should be most important, but it is still surprising that the latter should essentially play no role at all.
It is possible that \isi{frequency} is just not relevant in this particular context.
The production data support this idea, because \isi{frequency} turned out to be a (nearly) non-significant predictor in production as well.
All the same, a different test design that is specifically aimed at investigating \isi{frequency} effects in \isi{priming} experiments might be able to yield further interesting insights.

For the perception test, it would also be desirable to have a less biased sample of participants than the one this study is based on.
The dataset for perception is quite heavily skewed towards participants that are in their twenties and have a middle-class background.
This is not due to a flaw in design, but something of an unfortunate coincidence linked to the difficulties of recruiting participants over the internet.
A more balanced sample of subjects would, however, enable the researcher to conduct a much more thorough analysis of the impact of social characteristics of the perceivers than I have been able to do in this study.
The tentative results and conclusions presented in this book, and, more importantly, the ones that can be found in previous research \parencite[cf.][]{hayetal2006a,haydrager2010} strongly suggest that this is a fruitful area for future research that can help us to better understand how language perception works.

Turning back to the primary issue of this book, my analysis shows that \isi{exemplar} \isi{priming} in sociolinguistics not only needs a variable that comes with a high degree of social \isi{salience}.
In addition, two further requirements have to be met, at least when the goal is to create an \isi{assimilation effect}: 
The \isi{phonetic distance} between the prime\is{priming}d variety and the one actually used in the stimuli must be comparatively small, and \isi{categorisation} of the stimuli must be a comparatively difficult task to start with.
So far, criteria defining contexts where ``successful'' \isi{exemplar} \isi{priming} is to be expected have been lacking.
I hope that the ones I have suggested here can serve as a starting point for developing a more elaborate ``theory of \isi{priming}'' \parencite[cf.][]{cesario2014} in the realm of sociophonetics.
