First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor Daniel Hole for his constant support and for giving me the opportunity to work at a wonderful institute. I am also grateful for the support by my second advisor Markus Steinbach and I want to thank Ronnie Wilbur for her help and for the discussions that I really enjoyed. I am very grateful for the support of the Deaf communities of Munich, Stuttgart, and Heidelberg: thank you for introducing me to this wonderful language!
