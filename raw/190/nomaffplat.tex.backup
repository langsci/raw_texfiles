\section{Introduction: Plateau languages} %1. /

The \ili{Plateau} branch of East Benue-Congo consists of between sixty and eighty languages spoken in central Nigeria, spreading from Lake Shiroro to the banks of the Benue River (\figref{fig:nomaffplat:1}). Although most Plateau populations are small (2-10,000 speakers), there are probably more than a million speakers of \ili{Plateau} languages, with the bulk of the numbers made up from large groups such as \ili{Berom} and \ili{Eggon}. Some \ili{Plateau} languages, such as \ili{Sambe} and \ili{Yangkam}, are moribund and others are severely threatened, such as \ili{Ayu}. 

Plateau languages represent one of the four major branches of \ili{East Benue-Congo} outside \ili{Bantoid}, together with \ili{Kainji}, \ili{Jukunoid} and \ili{Cross River}. Internally, they are divided into a large number of subgroups, whose inter-relations are not well understood. \ili{Plateau} languages remain extremely poorly studied, with no complete grammar or dictionary for any language except \ili{Berom} (which is in \ili{French} and thus inaccessible to Nigerians). Basic overviews of their ethnography and ethnic distribution can be found in \citet{Temple1922}, \citet{Meek1925,Meek1931}, \citet{Gunn1953,Gunn1956} and \citet{CrozierBlench1992}.

The most striking feature of \ili{Plateau} is its morphological and typological diversity. It is usually assumed that \ili{Proto-Plateau} would have had a system of paired nominal prefixes with semantic associations and alliterative concord, similar to but probably less elaborate than \ili{Bantu}. However, these systems have collapsed and been rebuilt or in some cases disappeared completely. Compensatory morphology has evolved, including highly complex consonantal inventories and rich tone-systems. Synchronically, \ili{Plateau} languages display systems of consonant mutation, contrastive length, as well as palatalisation, labialisation, lateralisation of initial consonants and combinations of all these.

The origin of these diverse outcomes may lie in the characteristic marriage systems within the \ili{Plateau} region. These systems often involved linguistic exogamy, which, combined with marital instability, resulted in the pervasive multilingualism which almost certainly played a role in the evolution of complex ‘mixed’ systems of number marking. Plateau marriage systems are discussed in considerable detail in \citet{Muller1982}. Many different systems co-existed, and there is evidence that when absolute numbers of speakers were much lower (often as little as 500 per language in the pre-colonial era) this principle of outmarriage was strongly enforced.

Plateau languages are assumed to form part of the broader unit represented by \ili{East Benue-Congo} (\citealt{Williamson1971,Williamson1989,WilliamsonBlench2000}). The earliest source for \ili{Plateau}, \citet{Koelle1854} gives wordlists of \ili{Ham} (\ili{Hyam}), \ili{Koro of Lafia} (\ili{Migili}) and \ili{Yasgua} (\ili{Yeskwa}). \citet{Westermann1927} assigned the few languages for which he had data to a ``\ili{Benue-Cross}'' family, corresponding to present-day \ili{East Benue-Congo}, although later in \citet{WestermannBryan1952} these were classified as ``isolated units''. However, the modern subclassification of \ili{Plateau} derives principally from the work of Joseph \citet{Greenberg1963} who proposed dividing Westermann’s ``\ili{Benue-Cross}'' languages into seven co-ordinate groups (including modern-day \ili{Kainji} and \ili{Jukunoid}). With numerous emendations and additions these have been reprised in almost all subsequent works (notably \citealt{WilliamsonShimizu1968,Williamson1971,Williamson1972,Williamson1989,Maddieson1982,Gerhardt1989,CrozierBlench1992,Blench1998,Blench2000wocal}). \citet{Blenchn.d.a} reflects the most recent understanding of \ili{Plateau} subgrouping.

Comparative studies of number marking in the \ili{Plateau} languages are scarce; \citet{Bouquiaux1967} represents an initial attempt to discern commonalties across a small number of languages. 
Some \ili{Plateau} languages retain complex systems of nominal affixes and alliterative concord, notably \ili{Kulu} and other members of the northwest cluster and \ili{Tarok}. However, many languages, such as \ili{Cara} and the \ili{Ninzic} cluster, include some affix alternation as part of a repertoire of number marking strategies, while subgroups such as \ili{Ndunic} and \ili{Ake}, have completely lost these systems. Other languages, such as \ili{Izere}, have systems which look elaborate at first sight, but when segmental and tonal allomorphs are taken into account, the underlying number of pairings is considerably reduced. The existence of these systems certainly suggests that alternating affixes and concord were a feature of \ili{Proto-Plateau}, but actual segmental correspondences between affixes are few, pointing to a continuing process of renewal. \ili{Plateau} also has frequent nasal prefixes, as well as numerous examples of unproductive nasals preceding C\textsubscript{1} of the stem \citep{Miehe1991}. Some of these are reflected more widely in other branches of \ili{Benue-Congo} or even further afield in \ili{Kwa}. However, the correspondences between noun classes and semantic subsets (humans, trees, animals, paired things) characteristic of \ili{Bantu} are more tenuous.

The analytic challenge of \ili{Plateau} is to account for synchronic number marking systems through the lens of the erosion of affix alternation. In the light of this, the confident assertions of authors such as  \citet{deWolf1971} in reconstructing the prefixes of \ili{Proto-Benue-Congo} seem very optimistic. Such reconstructed forms reflect a prior knowledge of \ili{Bantu} and a large pool of miscellaneous data from which exemplars can be selectively chosen. This paper is an overview of nominal affixing in the \ili{Plateau} languages, based principally on my own fieldwork materials.\footnote{Lexical and grammatical materials are available on the author’s website \citet{Blenchn.d.b}}. It describes the systems in individual subgroups and then asks what evidence these provide for the situation in \ili{Proto-Plateau}.

None of the authors who have classified \ili{Plateau} languages have presented evidence for their classifications. This is not a criticism; faced with large arrays of data it is easier to set out what appears to be the case impressionistically than to write a monograph demonstrating it. The series of publications on \ili{Plateau} subgroups, especially Plateau II and IV, by
\citeauthor{Gerhardt1969a} (%

assume the boundaries of these groups. A particular issue in the internal classification of \ili{Plateau} and \ili{Jukunoid} is the notion of a ‘\ili{Benue}’ grouping. \citet[415]{Shimizu1975} proposed that some branches of \ili{Plateau} should be classified with \ili{Jukunoid}. In particular, he argued that \ili{Eggon} (and by implication the other Plateau V languages, including \ili{Nungu} and \ili{Yeskwa}) and \ili{Tarokoid} (at that time consisting only of \ili{Yergam} (=\ili{Tarok}) and \ili{Basherawa} (=\ili{Yaŋkam})) formed a group together with \ili{Jukunoid}. This emerged from his lexico-statistical tables and was further supported by five isoglosses, the words for ‘drink’, ‘tail’, ‘meat’, ‘fire’, and ‘four’. This expanded group he christened ``\ili{Benue}''. \citet{Gerhardt1983b} questioned Shimizu’s hypothesis noting both that his own lexico-statistical work (\citealt{GerhardtJockers1981}) did not support this, and casting doubt on the five isoglosses proposed by Shimizu. The ‘\ili{Benue}’ group continued in a sort of half-life, appearing in \citet{Gerhardt1989} as a subgrouping of \ili{Jukunoid} and \ili{Tarokoid} against the rest of \ili{Plateau}. \citet{Blench2005} has presented evidence that there is a genuine boundary between \ili{Plateau} and \ili{Jukunoid}, drawing on lexical and morphological evidence.

\largerpage[-1]
This uncertainty is a reflection of a more general problem, the evidence for a bounded group ``\ili{Plateau}'' in opposition to \ili{Kainji}, \ili{Jukunoid}, \ili{Dakoid} or \ili{Mambiloid}, other members of the \ili{Benue-Congo} complex. The relationships between \ili{Plateau} languages, their coherence as a grouping and their links with \ili{Jukunoid} and \ili{Kainji} remain undetermined. \citet{Rowlands1962} was the first to suggest that there was a dichotomy between certain languages of the Jos area, which he linked to West \ili{Kainji}, and the remainder, but his short wordlists were far from constituting linguistic proof. Comparative analysis has produced some tentative evidence for isoglosses defining \ili{Plateau}, but so far no phonological or morphological innovations that would define the group have been proposed. Some of this diversity is undoubtedly due to long-term interactions with the mosaic of \ili{Chadic} languages also occurring on the Jos Plateau \citep{Blench2003}.

With these caveats, \figref{fig:nomaffplat:2} presents a new subclassification of \ili{Plateau}, within the context of \ili{East Benue-Congo}. Evidence for this subgrouping is presented in Blench (in press). The majority of evidence is lexical, but some subgroups, such as Northwest, clearly also share considerable common elements in the noun-class system. This ``tree'' is clearly not final, as there are too many co-ordinate branches and too little internal structure. But until further analysis is undertaken, provisional versions of \ili{Plateau} which do not promote too many unwarranted assumptions are the best that can be produced.

This paper is organised using these \ili{Plateau} subgroups and listed approximately left to right. The summary Tables \ref{tab:nomaffplat:1}--\ref{tab:nomaffplat:1z} also gives a list of all known \ili{Plateau} languages. The great majority of material presented here is either from my own fieldwork since 1980, from manuscript sources, with a relatively small amount from published work, cited in the reference list. Where no source is cited, it can be taken this is my own data. All original wordlists can be found on my website.\footnote{Lexical and grammatical materials are available on the author’s website \citet{Blenchn.d.b}} Some of the earliest data is not tone-marked, and the segmental transcription may be less reliable. Most \ili{Plateau} languages have a three-level tone system and by convention the mid-tone is not marked. Therefore, if the data is tone-marked, a vowel without a tone is deemed to be mid. Where a standardised orthography exists, for example in the case of \ili{Mada}, only the high tone is unmarked. I have noted deviations from the standard tone marking in relation to relevant examples.

\largerpage[-1]
The sample wordlist is usually five hundred items and of these some 350 are nouns with singular and plural recorded. Allowing for entries that cannot be elicited, the nouns available for analysis amount to around 300. Where the data has not been collected by the author, the sample may be smaller, whereas in the case of dictionaries prepared by the author, for example \ili{Berom}, \ili{Izere}, \ili{Mada} and \ili{Tarok} the sample is usually well over a thousand. For most languages only singular/plural pairs are available, but where a grammar sketch has been prepared, we also have an overview of the concord system. The reader should refer to the original wordlist for examples of the noun-class pairings, where these are summarised in the tables below.

\ili{Plateau} languages exhibit extensive allomorphy in their nominal affix systems. Allomorphs are here defined as ‘one of two or more complementary morphs which manifest a morpheme in its different phonological or morphological environments’ \citet{LoosEtAl2003}. In \ili{Plateau}, tonal allomorphs are common because the tone of the prefix may be driven by the tone of the stem, thus the V of a CV prefix may have one of three tone levels, as for example in \ili{Kulu}. Sometimes claims of allomorphy in less-well-studied languages are only educated guesses, based on parallels with better known languages. The term alternation is used to apply to the change in prefix on a stem marking number, i.e. singular and either one or two plurals. Throughout the text, the tables present a summary of the prefix alternations occurring in the data, mostly wordlists. This is not ideal, as we have no evidence for the patterns of concord in many languages, but it provides a preliminary guide to the synchronic system.

\section{Plateau languages by subgroup} %2. /

Tables \ref{tab:nomaffplat:1}--\ref{tab:nomaffplat:1z} show a comprehensive list of \ili{Plateau} languages, by subgroup, and a summary of the system of number-marking, as far as it is known. Where there is a published reference on a specific language, it is given, although I do not always agree with the analysis and the text presents my own hypothesis. No entry in the reference column means the summary is based on my own fieldwork. The names of the branches are proposed by the author, since the classification is at variance with previous proposals in many areas. Further justification can be found in \citet{Blench2000wocal}.

\subsection{Northwest Plateau} %2.1 /

\ili{Northwest Plateau} consists of \ili{Eda}/\ili{Edra}, \ili{Acro-Obiro} [=\ili{Kuturmi}], \ili{Kulu}, \ili{Idon}, Do\-ka\il{Doka} and \ili{Iku-Gora-Ankwe}. No new data has been published since this group was set up, although a wordlist of \ili{Kulu} has been circulated (\citealt{Moser1982}, analysed in \citealt{Seitz1993}) and \citet{Shimizu1996} has posted a grammar sketch on the Internet. Recent interest in Ẹda\il{Eda@Ẹda} [=\ili{Kadara}] language has resulted in an unpublished dialect survey, a preliminary alphabet book and the launching of an alphabet chart in 2009. \ili{Kadara} is known to its speakers as ‘\il{Eda@Ẹda}Ẹda’ and there is a closely related lect, Ẹdra\il{Edra@Ẹdra} (which is presumably the source of the common \ili{Hausa} name). Two other lects for which information is recorded, Ẹjẹgha\il{Ejegha@Ẹjẹgha} and \il{Ehwa@Ẹhwa}Ẹhwa,\footnote{Thanks to Zac Yoder for sound files of wordlists of 384 items of these languages. Retranscribed by the author.} correspond to \ili{Idon} and the \ili{Iku-Gora-Ankwe} clusters (as named in the \ili{Benue-Congo} Comparative Wordlist in \citealt{WilliamsonShimizu1968,Williamson1972}). The wordlists are so different from each other and from Ẹda\il{Eda@Ẹda} that they clearly deserve separate language status. \ili{Northwest Plateau} remains a high priority for further research.

\tabref{tab:nomaffplat:2} shows the singular/plural prefix pairings recorded in \ili{Kulu} including tonal variants, based on \citet{Moser1982} and \citet{Seitz1993}. A postulated ‘underlying’ prefix is given together with its allomorphs. The mid-front vowel shows harmony with the stem-vowel. The bracketed nasals in the plural prefixes show their sporadic appearance. They are homorganic with the following consonant and only follow /i/.

Tonal variation in prefixes is driven by the stem-tone (as in many \ili{Plateau} languages, cf. \citealt{Blench2000b}) and the different surface tones do not in themselves mark distinct pairs marked for number. The numerous forms of a \textit{gV}- prefix presumably point to these all originally having a single underspecified vowel which has gradually diverged.\footnote{One reviewer queries the directionality of this process. However, if instead this were a case of convergence, this would require ten different surface forms to come together, which is hardly an economical explanation.} The presence of an underspecified vowel in the V of a prefix is very common in the \ili{East Kainji} languages with which \ili{Kulu} is in contact and it is possible this is a borrowing.

\ili{Kulu} has frequent doubled /l/ in stem-initial position, assumed to derive from nasal prefixes which have been first fossilised and then assimilated to an initial lateral. For example \REF{ex:nomaffplat:1}:

\ea\label{ex:nomaffplat:1}
\ea  Doubled /l/ in stem-initial position
\ex  \textit{gɛ́-llam}    ‘water’ 
\ex  \textit{gu-llúrú} ‘storm’ 
\ex \textit{gɛ-llán}    ‘chin’
\ex \textit{gɛ̀-llìbì}    ‘hyena’
\z

Semantic associations in \ili{Kulu} are weak, but the majority of nouns for persons show \textit{E-/bE-} prefix alternation. Most domestic animals have a \textit{gV-} singular prefix but no consistent plural marking. Wild animals, on the other hand, almost all have their singular and plural forms distinguished only by tonal differences in the stem. Trees, body parts, abstracts and even mass nouns do not form consistent sets marked by paired affixes. The \textit{ni-} prefix for noun plurals is uncommon and surprisingly, it is strongly correlated with household items as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:2}.

However, \ili{Kulu} does operate a principle of using prefixes to assign semantics, such as the parts of a tree, by means of prefixes, as for example in \REF{ex:nomaffplat:3}:

\subsection{Beromic}

The term ‘\ili{Beromic}’ has been adopted here to cover former Plateau 2 languages. \ili{Beromic} now consists of \ili{Berom}, \ili{Iten}, \ili{Cara} and two closely related lects, \ili{Shall} and \ili{Zwall}, geographically distant in Bauchi State. The principal publications on \ili{Berom} are \citet{Bouquiaux1970,Bouquiaux2001} and \citet{KuhnDusu1985}, and on \ili{Iten}, \citet{Bouquiaux1964}. Recent unpublished materials are dictionaries of \ili{Berom} and \ili{Iten}. \ili{Cara} (\ili{Teriya}) was reported in a mimeo paper by \citet{Shimizu1975b}, who first proposed a link with \ili{Berom}. \ili{Shall} and \ili{Zwall} were previously classified with the \ili{Ninzic} languages (Plateau 4), but are better placed with \ili{Beromic} \citet{Blenchn.d.c}. \ili{Beromic} languages show a broad range of number-marking systems, although none have a full noun-class system and \ili{Shall-Zwall} has lost all nominal affixing, perhaps under the influence of \ili{Chadic}. A summary of \ili{Beromic} number marking is shown in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:3}.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:nomaffplat:3} Number-marking in Beromic.\\ {Source: All analyses of Beromic by author based on personal fieldwork.}}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lQ}

\ili{Shall-Zwall} 	& Nominal prefixes entirely lost\\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


\ili{Berom} itself has a complex internal structure. \ili{Central Berom} includes the Du dialect described by \citet{Bouquiaux1970,Bouquiaux2001} as well as both \ili{Vwang} (\ili{Vom}) and \ili{Ryom} (\ili{Riyom}). The speakers of \ili{Vwang} are the most numerous, but the main dia\-lect used for literacy and bible translation is the Eastern dialect, roughly centred on Foron, spoken by only a minority. The other minority dialect is \ili{Rim}, south and east of the main centres. Data on \ili{Berom} presented here is based on long-term fieldwork on the \ili{Foron} dialect and shows marked differences with the \ili{Du} of Bouquiaux.

\ili{Berom} noun pluralisation strategies are extremely varied. The most common are:

\begin{itemize}
 \item[a)] prefix addition or alternation
 \item[b)] tone-raising
 \item[c)]  (de)labialisation
 \item[d)] consonant alternation
 \item[e)]  number marking in verbal nouns replicating corresponding verbal plurals
\end{itemize}

In some cases, two procedures can be applied to mark a plural, suggesting the dynamics of renewal. The great majority of \ili{Berom} singular nouns have no prefix, while on nouns that are marked for plural, the \textit{be}- prefix is predominant. \ili{Berom} shows ‘echo’ concord, where a small subset of concordial adjectives exactly copy the nominal prefix of the noun they qualify. Where the noun has no prefix, the adjective shows no concord. Berom also has just three suppletive plurals in a dictionary which includes more than 2000 nouns. Due to this relatively large database, it is possible to estimate the frequency of nominal prefix alternations in \ili{Eastern Berom} seen in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:4}.

Tone-marks show the most characteristic tone for this class, with mid-tone unmarked. However, there are numerous unexplained exceptions, which may reflect interaction with the stem-vowel. \textit{ra-} is not attested synchronically as a productive prefix, since all singular nouns in current \ili{Berom} with stem-initial \textit{ra}- have a zero singular prefix and a plural prefix \textit{be-}. However, many words have \textit{ra}- as a first syllable, such as \textit{rato} ‘head’ where the \textit{ra}- is not historically part of the root, because –\textit{to} is widely attested across \ili{Benue-Congo} for ‘head’.


The alternation \textit{wo-/be-}, in \REF{ex:nomaffplat:4}, is the ethnonym for the \ili{Berom} people, and is probably not originally a noun class pair. \textit{wo} is a personal pronoun and \textit{be}- a generic plural marker.


\ea\label{ex:nomaffplat:4}
{  \textit{Wòrom}  ‘Berom person’ \\        \textit{Berom}   ‘Berom people’}\\
\z

The labial and palatal infixes \textit{-w-} and \textit{-y-} almost certainly originally derive from \textit{u-} and \textit{i-} prefixes which have been incorporated into the stem, as in many other \ili{Plateau} languages. \citet{KiesslingMutations2010} has described analogous processes in the languages of the \ili{Grassfields} of Cameroun. Tonal changes accompany number marking suggest that the tone of the lost prefix vowel affected the stem tone of the noun.

The nasal prefixes form a complex set. It is most likely there is a diminutive marker \textit{ne}- which shows up both as a plural prefix and unpaired in non-count nouns, as well as in \textit{ke}-/\textit{ne}- alternations marking small entities in \REF{extab:nomaffplat:5}. The \textit{ke}- is probably cognate with \ili{Bantu} \textit{ka}- which has a similar diminutive function \citep[88]{Maho1999}.

Presumably these originally had a singulative, \textit{fu}-, and the stem-initial \textit{t}- was deleted, converting the high back vowel into a labial.

\subsection{West-Central} %2.3 /
\subsubsection{General}

\ili{West-Central Plateau} consists of what used to be known as the ‘\ili{Southern Zaria}’ languages. Published and manuscript sources include \citet{Koelle1854,Gerhardt1971,Gerhardt1974,Gerhardt1983a,Gerhardt1994,AdwiraahHagen1983,Adwiraah1989,McKinney1979,McKinney1983,Norris1984,Norris1990,Follingstad1991,Follingstadnd}. Although these languages are clearly linked, no published evidence supports their coherence as a group. The languages \ili{Nandu} [=\ili{Ndun}] and \ili{Tari} [=\ili{Shakara}] were listed in \citet{CrozierBlench1992} as part of this group. This is erroneous; \ili{Ndun-Shakara}, together with the newly discovered \ili{Nyeng}, form their own group, \ili{Ndunic} (\sectref{sec:nomaffplat:2.4}). The \ili{West-Central Plateau} languages are a coherent geographical clustering and undoubtedly show numerous links with one another, but their genetic unity is unproven. \citet[67ff]{Gerhardt1983a} presents a comparative wordlist showing cognates between \ili{Rigwe}, \ili{Izere} and \ili{Tyap}. However, with both new insights into the phonology of these languages, and in particular the large number of lects still unrecorded at that period, a new comparative analysis is still to be undertaken. \figref{fig:nomaffplat:3} presents the known groups of \ili{West-Central Plateau} as a flat array.

\subsubsection{Rigwe}  %2.3.2 /

The \ili{Rigwe} language is spoken southeast of Jos. It is notable for an extremely complex phonology \citep{Anon2006}. Any former system of extensive alternating affixes has been replaced by a standard pluralising prefix or by a variety of tonal changes. Analysis of \ili{Rigwe} was undertaken by the author in co-operation with Daniel Gya. \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:5} lists the strategies for plural marking in \ili{Rigwe} with their allomorphs.

\end{table}


Class II nouns have a \textit{ɾV-/\`{N}}- alternation. \textit{rV-} is realized as \textit{ɾi-} when the stem vowel is front, and as \textit{ɾu-} when the stem-vowel is back. \textit{\`{N}-} is realised as \textit{ɲ-} before palatals \textit{ɲ-} and \textit{j-} and as \textit{ǹ-} elsewhere. \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:10} presents examples of the operation of this class.

\newpage 
As the glosses show, the nasal prefix is associated with human and animal body parts, which seems to be innovative. The Class III alternation in \ili{Rigwe} is \textit{ø-/\`{N}-}, where \textit{\`{N}-} is homorganic with the following consonant, realised as \textit{ɲ-} before palatals, \textit{ŋ-} before velars and \textit{n-} elsewhere. Only /a/, /e/ and /u/ have been recorded as stem vowels in Class III. Unlike the other classes, the stem tone changes and is always low, regardless of the tone in the singular. \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:11} presents examples of this class. This class is equally associated with body parts but is otherwise miscellaneous.

In Class IV, an extra-low nasal prefix is raised to mid, and an extra-low stem-tone becomes falling, shown in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:12}.

\ili{Rigwe} has innovated in nominal affixing to such an extent that no obvious connection with postulated classes for either \ili{Niger-Congo} or \ili{Bantu} can be discerned.

The \ili{Tyapic} languages are named for \ili{Tyap}, or \ili{Kataf} in older sources. The group consists of six languages (\ili{Tyap}, \ili{Gworok}, \ili{Atakar}, \ili{Kacicere}, \ili{Sholyo}, and \ili{Kafancan}), with the closely related \ili{Jju}\footnote{It is usual to list \ili{Jju} separately from the \ili{Tyap} cluster but this seems increasingly to reflect ethnic separation rather than linguistic reality.}. Only \ili{Tyap} itself is well-described \citep{Follingstad1991}. The prefixed elements appear to be innovative and consist of a (\textit{Ca}-) and its allomorphs. However, the noun is also followed a variety of alternating CV suffixes. These are almost certainly noun-class affixes, now placed after the stem. \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:6} shows a summary of \ili{Tyap} nominal affixes and concord as well as examples of nominal pairs.

The elements marked ‘post-concord’ in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:6} were almost certainly former CV prefixes which have been copied at the end of the word, a procedure attested elsewhere in \ili{Niger-Congo}. They are written in the orthography as distinct words as they do not show phonological merger with the root they follow.


Plurals reduplicate by doubling the first syllable of the root. Thus \REF{ex:nomaffplat:13}:


\ea\label{ex:nomaffplat:13}
{ Plurals reduplicate the first root syllable}\\

  \textit{ə̀kwənka}    ‘tree’     \textit{ə̀kə̀kwə̀n nà}   ‘trees’
\z

Classes 1/2, with the suffixes \textit{wu/ba}, probably corresponds to \ili{Bantu} class 1/2 and includes many \ili{Tyap} nouns for human beings. Class 9, which is unpaired, includes liquids such as \textit{ə̀sə̀khwôt nà} ‘water’ and \textit{ə̀bààn na} ‘milk’ which is semantically similar to \ili{Niger-Congo} Class 6. The homorganic plural nasal prefix in Class 8a is possibly to be compared with \ili{Bantu} Class 6 where it is the plural of Class 5 ‘paired things’, e.g. \textit{mbwàk na} ‘hands’.

\citet[79]{Follingstad1991} shows that concord in \ili{Tyap} is much reduced with only a few adjectives and lower numerals showing any agreement. The agreement is of the ‘direct-copy’ or ‘echo’ type, where the numeral has the same prefix as the noun it agrees with.

\subsubsection{Izeric} %2.3.4 /

The \ili{Izeric} languages consist of northwest \ili{Izere}, northeast \ili{Izere}, \ili{Cèn}, \ili{Ganàng} and \ili{Fəràn}.\footnote{These last three are essentially single settlements, whereas the others represent clusters of villages, hence the rather asymmetric geographical names.} The language which is best-known is \ili{Izere of Fobur} but wordlists suggest that the affix pairings in the other languages are broadly similar.\footnote{Analysis of \ili{Izere} was undertaken by the author in collaboration with Bitrus Kaze.} \citet{Blench2000b} is a more detailed description of \ili{Izere} number marking. Nominal plurals in \ili{Izere of Fobur} are formed in four ways:

 
\begin{itemize}
 \item[a.]  affix alternation
 \item[b.]  stem-tone alternation
 \item[c.]  deverbal nouns that copy the alternations of verb stems
 \item[d.]  suppletion
\end{itemize}

Affix alternation and stem-tone alternation are frequently combined producing a very large number of plural formations. \ili{Izere of Fobur} has a relatively restricted set of segmental noun-class prefixes. \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:7} shows \ili{Izere} nominal affix pairings.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:nomaffplat:7} Izere nominal affix pairings}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXl}
\lsptoprule
  Singular 	&   Plural 	&   Semantics\\
  \midrule

\itshape ri- 	& \itshape a- 	& miscellaneous\\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx} 
\end{table}

Tone cannot be specified for most \ili{Izere} prefixes, since it reflects the tone of the stem. The unpaired mass noun prefix, corresponding to \ili{Niger-Congo} Class 6, is always low tone. \textit{ka}- and its allomorph \textit{ki}-, realised when the noun stem contains a palatal, can function as a diminutive prefix. Paired \textit{ka}- and \textit{ku}- were probably allomorphs of one another historically, since there is a tendency for stem-vowels following \textit{ka}- to be front or central and those following \textit{ku}- to be back. However, exceptions now abound, suggesting a historical class split. 

\ili{Izere} has an unpaired \textit{nà}- prefix for liquids and solids which probably corresponds to the \textit{ma}- prefix in \ili{Niger-Congo}, shown in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:14}.

\begin{table}

There is no evidence for a link between the common \textit{na}- prefix in \ili{Izere} and \ili{Bantu} nasal prefixes.
 
\subsubsection{Hyamic} %2.3.5 /

The \ili{Hyamic} languages are spoken between Kwoi and Nok, southwest of Jos and are now central to the prehistoric Nok culture. The members of the \ili{Hyamic} cluster are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \ili{Cori}
\item \ili{Hyam} cluster (incl. Kwyeny, Yaat, Sait, Dzar, \ili{Hyam} of Nok)
\item \ili{Shamang}
\item \ili{Zhire-Shang}
\end{itemize}

Many of these languages are very poorly known and existing descriptions are tonally and phonologically inadequate (e.g. \citealt{Dihoff1976,Jockers1982}).

\ili{Hyam} has a wide range of strategies to mark nominal plurals. Analysis of \ili{Hyamic} languages is based solely on fieldwork by the author. The most important are shown in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:8}:

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:nomaffplat:8} Examples of Hyam noun pluralisation strategies}

\end{tabularx}
\end{table} 

Transcription of tone is best described as schematic; \ili{Hyam} has a highly complex tone-system which is far from being fully understood, but which includes multiple contour tones, combining different levels of the underlying three-tone system.

All of these point to the former existence of nominal prefix alternation and palatalisation and labialisation to incorporated \textit{i}- and \textit{u}- prefixes. The \textit{ma}- prefix on ‘leaf’ is exceptional and not linked with the Class 6 prefix. The \textit{mò}- prefix is applied to most humans, large animals and reptiles, but not other animals, and a small scatter of miscellaneous lexemes. The \textit{na}-/\textit{fu}- singular/plural alternation is only recorded for a few nouns related to occupations as in \REF{ex:nomaffplat:15}, and may be some sort of reassigned relative marker (‘one who’) rather than a relic nominal affix.

Almost all verbs and adjectives have obligatory plural forms and many undergo the same phonological shifts or mutations as nouns. Adjectives agree in number, i.e. where the noun is plural, the plural adjective is obligatory, but they do not show the type of alliterative concord characteristic of noun-class languages.

The \ili{Shang} language, while lexically \ili{Hyamic}, has a nominal affix system resembling \ili{Tinɔr} and similar \ili{Koro} languages (\sectref{sec:nomaffplat:2.3.7}) \citet{Blenchn.d.d}. \ili{Shang} has a reduced system of nominal affixes. The main noun-class pairs are between zero affixes in the singular and plural \textit{a}- and \textit{i}- prefixes seen in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:9}. Rare plural prefixes include \textit{ka}-, \textit{u}- and \textit{ru}-. No singular affix, either productive or fossil, has been recorded. Some nouns referring to persons have a singular/plural alternation \textit{nè}-/\textit{fú}- (as in \ili{Hyam}) but these are probably not old affixes but compounded terms for ‘person’. The tone on the vowel of the plural affix always appears to be low.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:nomaffplat:9} Shang nominal affix pairings}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXXl}
\lsptoprule
 Affix 	& {Sg.} 	& {Pl.} 	& Gloss\\

\itshape à-/ru- 	& \itshape à-bin 	& \itshape rù-bin 	& ‘thing’\\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\largerpage
Semantic correlations are not very clear for most of these pairings. However, there is a strong predominance of body parts with the \textit{ka}- plural affix. Most nouns relating to persons have an \textit{a}- prefix in the plural, but since this is statistically the most common prefix, this may not be significant. There is no trace of nasal prefixes.

\subsubsection{Gyongic} %2.3.6 /

Gyongic is the closest relative of \ili{Hyamic} and consists of two languages, \ili{Gyong} [\ili{Kagoma}] and \ili{Angan} [\ili{Kamanton}]. Neither language is well-known but there is a description of \ili{Gyong} which includes information on noun-classes \citep{Hagen1988}. According to this, \ili{Gyong} marks plurals with prefix alternation, palatalisation alternation and tone. The data tables below follow her presentation. The reduced prefix system is as follows in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:16}.

\begin{table}

\itshape kì- 	& \itshape ø-, rì-\\
\lspbottomrule
 \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Interestingly, liquids, abstracts and mass nouns fall into the unpaired \textit{kì}- class in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:17}.

Stem-tone changes multiply the possible number-marking strategies. \citet[139]{Hagen1988} gives examples of adjectival agreement in \REF{ex:nomaffplat:18}.

\subsubsection{Koro}\label{sec:nomaffplat:2.3.7}

The \ili{Koro} cluster consists of five languages spoken in Central Nigeria, north of Keffi. The published literature is sparse and based on limited data (\citealt{Gerhardt19723b,Goroh2000}). All the material presented on the \ili{Koro} languages is based on fieldwork by the author. \figref{fig:nomaffplat:4} shows a tentative outline classification of the languages in the \ili{Koro} cluster.

\ili{Waci} has retained a much richer noun-class system than any of the related languages, although it is in decay – see \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:10}. There is a strong tendency to cite some types of nouns, especially those to do with living things, without a singular prefix and to reduce the pluralisation marker to an \textit{a-} prefix. Moreover, there are a very large number of singular/plural pairings, many of them only occurring once suggesting a complex process of re-analysis is under way. Some prefixes have several allomorphs, probably prefiguring class merger. There is some semantic correlation with prefix pairings: for example, humans commonly have \textit{u-/bV}- prefixes and animals most often \textit{ì/i-}, but the correlation is far from perfect.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:nomaffplat:10} Waci nominal affix pairings}

There is no evidence for a distinctive mass noun prefix. Some liquids, such as water (\textit{bàm}) and blood (\textit{bèʤí}) show no singular/plural prefix alternation, while others, such as tears, saliva and urine, have diverse singular/plural affix pairs.

The \textit{bV}- plural prefix almost always marks persons and is usually, but not always paired with \textit{u}- singular \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:20}. The vowel is underspecified and very often copies the stem vowel, although \textit{b}+ high vowel (i.e. \textit{bi}- and \textit{bu}-) is apparently not permitted.

There is a tendency for the V- of other plural prefixes to copy the ±ATR properties of the stem vowel where these are mid. See \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:21}.

The \ili{Waci} prefix \textit{yV}- where V is always a front vowel is usually paired with \textit{bV}- in the plural seen in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:26}, although these nouns do not refer to persons as might be expected by analogy to the pairing of \textit{mu-/ba-} (classes 1/ 2) for persons in \ili{Bantu}.

One of the most striking alternations is \textit{gV-/rV-}, which does not seem to have any immediate parallel in other \ili{Koro} languages. The \textit{-V-} in \textit{gV-} can be any vowel except the high back vowels. The vowel quality in the \textit{gV-} prefix partly reflects stem vowels although the correlation is not perfect. Similarly, most plurals have \textit{rV-} with a few exceptions (\tabref{extab:nomaffplat:27}). Some \textit{yV-} prefixes, such as ‘faeces’ in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:26} may well be allomorphs of \textit{gV-} to judge by the \textit{rV-} plurals.

The \ili{Waci} nominal affix system seems to have undergone major renewal. Apart from a class pair for persons and a rather weak animal class, there is no evidence for an unpaired non-count noun prefix and no evidence for semantically clustered prefix pairs elsewhere.

\subsection{Ndunic (=Ahwai)} \label{sec:nomaffplat:2.4}

\ili{Ndunic} is a new name proposed here for the languages previously called ‘\ili{Nandu-Tari}’. Existing sources list two languages, but a third language, \ili{Ningon}, was first recorded in 2003. The \ili{Ndunic} languages are spoken in a small area southwest of Fadan Karshi. The correct names for these languages are \ili{Ndun} (\ili{Nandu}), \ili{Shakara} (\ili{Tari}) and \ili{Ningon}. The languages are extremely close to one another. The Ndunic peoples have recently adopted the name ‘\ili{Ahwai}’ as a cover term for all three languages \citep{RueckEtAl2008}. \ili{Shakara} has a much reduced set of nominal affixes, but \ili{Ndun} has numerous nominal singular/plural affix pairs. All the tables for \ili{Ndunic} languages are based on fieldwork by the present author. The main attested noun-class pairings of \ili{Ndun} are shown in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:11}.

However, there are also numerous plurals created by tonal change and by presence and absence of labialisation and palatalisation. Sporadic nasalisation appears between the stem and the prefix as a result of fossil nominal prefixes, although \ili{Ndun} still preserves a few productive nasal prefixes. \ili{Ndun} has many noun-class pairings that only occur once, in part due to the underspecified vowels. The tones are too insecurely marked to be sure that there are no additional contrasts on the \textit{V-} prefixes.

\end{table}

Palatalisation can be applied to almost any initial consonant in singular/plural formation, often combined with primary affix alternation as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:28}. The likely historical explanation is that there was an initial \textit{i}- prefix which was incorporated into the stem and then a new plural affix (ironically sometimes a new \textit{ i}- prefix) was applied subsequently.

In addition there are many nouns with initial homorganic nasals (\textit{m-, n-, ŋ-}) which seem to have been incorporated during an earlier wave of prefix incorporation.

It is not uncommon for \ili{Ndun} nouns for persons to be \textit{-r} final \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:31}:

\begin{table}
\caption{Ndun nominals with final \textit{-r}}
\label{extab:nomaffplat:31}
\begin{tabularx}{.8\textwidth}{XXl}

‘friend’ 	&  \itshape èsamir 	&  \itshape bésamir\\
 \lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


 In one case, the final \textit{-r} alternates with a final nasal as in \REF{ex:nomaffplat:32}.


\eabox{\label{ex:nomaffplat:32}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lll}
‘woman’ 	&  \itshape nyaan 	&  \itshape nyaar\\
\end{tabularx}
}

These are probably the traces of former prefixes which have moved to final position and have almost lost their class pair alternation. Semantic correlations with noun-class affix pairings are weak at best. The \textit{e-/be-} prefix pair includes many nouns referring to persons (\tabref{extab:nomaffplat:33}).

Most liquids have initial \textit{m-} or  \textit{mV-} and this presumably reflects \ili{Niger-Congo} Class 6 \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:34}. 

\begin{table}
\caption{Ndun \textit{mV-} prefixes marking liquids}

\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


However, where \textit{mV}- appears as a plural number marker it seems to show no semantic correlation. No other \ili{Ndun} prefixes show any tendency to reflect semantic classes such as body parts, trees or salient animals.

Shakara now has a much reduced system, but \ili{Proto-Ndunic} clearly had a wide range of nominal affix pairs, with fragmentary evidence for a suffix alternation to do with persons. Nasal prefixes were clearly very common but have become so generalised across the system it is now difficult to discern what part they may have played in the original affix alternations.

\subsection{Ninzic} %2.5 /

\ili{Ninzic}, formerly Plateau IV, is probably the most difficult group to characterise and weak data on several languages make it unclear whether certain peripheral languages really belong to it. The name \ili{Ninzic} is introduced here, reflecting the element \textit{nin}-, which is part of many ethnonyms. The \ili{Ninzic} languages are spoken south of Fadan Karshi in Plateau, Nassarawa and Kaduna States. The membership of \ili{Ninzic} has changed quite significantly between various publications noted in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:12}.

The number marking systems of \ili{Ninzic} must originally have been paired affixes with alliterative concord, as fragments of such systems are found across the group. However, in most languages the system has broken down or become severely eroded and compensatory strategies have evolved. This section uses examples from \ili{Ninzo} based on \citet{Hörner1980,NinzoLanguageProjectCommittee1999} and fieldwork in Fadan Wate in 1995 \citet{Blenchn.d.e}. \ili{Ninzo} prefix pairings are in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:35}.

Many words have unproductive prefixes and singular and plural is now marked only by tone. Some \textit{u-/a-} prefix alternations are co-associated with \textit{u-/i-} alternations in the first vowel of the stem in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:36}.

Other \textit{u/a-} prefix alternations also incorporate alternations of CV syllables of the stem as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:37}, particularly \textit{u-nV-/a-bV-}. These suggest an unusual process, the retention of a former \textit{ni-/bi}- alternation with the addition of an innovative prefix system preceding it. The \textit{bV}- plural marker is reminiscent of \ili{Niger-Congo} \textit{ba}- but this may be coincidence; the core lexemes for persons in \ili{Ninzo} do not have this alternation. A partial development from this is the formation of plural with \textit{VnV}- prefixes \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:38}. For example, \textit{à}- and \textit{ì}- singular prefixes alternate with \textit{ànV}- plural prefixes.

\end{table}

As \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:38} shows there is quite a strong correlation between animals and the \textit{anV}- plural prefix, which is highly reminiscent of the \ili{Bantu} Class 9 \textit{nì}- singular prefix for animals. \ili{Ninzo} shows no obvious active or fossil morphology for non-count nouns although the word for ‘water’, \textit{amasíɽ}, has inherited the \textit{ma}- affix from related Plateau languages.

\newpage 
A common number marking process, which can be combined with prefix alternations, is reduplication of the first syllable of the root seen in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:39}. The vowel of the reduplicated syllable is usually \textit{/i/}, but /\textit{u/} in two unexplained cases.

\ili{Ninzic} languages have highly diverse nominal morphology and space precludes describing all of them. Many have a non-count noun prefix, but this seems to vary from one group to another. For example, \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:40} shows the prefix for liquids in \ili{Ce}, \textit{bə-}, which is quite consistent, but which seems to be segmentally unrelated to \ili{Niger-Congo} Class 6, usually \textit{mV-}.

This is an example of metatypy, the copying of a structural feature without the associated segments.

The \ili{Mada} language has undergone a striking collapse of characteristic affix alternations, which have then been rebuilt using grammaticalisation strategies, which have resulted in highly idiosyncratic marking of nominal plurals. These can be divided into six categories:

\ea
\begin{enumerate}
\item[I]    tone-change
\item[II]   initial syllable reduplication
\item[III]  prefix addition
\item[IV]   person nouns grammaticalised as pseudo-prefixes
\item[V]    diminutives grammaticalised as pseudo-prefixes
\item[VI]   suppletives
\end{enumerate}
\z

Prefixes marking size can alternate with non-prefixed nouns creating a pleth\-o\-ra of additional forms. Some nouns usually take diminutive prefixes in speech, but these are not easy to predict. The historical layering of these number marking strategies can be detected through the existence of multiple forms, sometimes with, for example, tone-raising applied to a noun formerly which also has first syllable reduplication or prefix addition. The consequence of this has been that the tone-plurals of \ili{Mada} show extremely low levels of predictability as in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:13}.

The most recent addition to the \ili{Mada} repertoire of plural strategies is probably the \textit{mə-} prefix. This appears to have two realisations, \textit{mə̀-} and \textit{mə̄-}. The low-tone form seems to have no strongly-defined semantic field in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:41}, but mid-tone \textit{mə̄-} is applied quite strictly to persons in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:42}. The examples in these tables and in other sections show the prefix has been added, sometimes subsequently to other strategies, such as tone-raising or reduplication, providing evidence for its recent genesis. Most nouns taking a \textit{mə̀-} prefix conserve stem-tone in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:41}.


\ili{Mada} provides a striking example of how rapidly a nominal affix system can break down and then be rebuilt using processes of grammaticalisation, thereby illustrating the difficulties of tracing synchronic affixes back to a presumed proto-system.

\subsection{Alumic} \label{sec:nomaffplat:2.6}

One subgroup of Plateau languages spoken in Central Nigeria has effectively no published data. These languages are \ili{Hasha} [=\ili{Yashi}], \ili{Sambe}, \ili{Alumu-Təsu} and \ili{Toro} [=\ili{Turkwam}]. Except for \ili{Sambe}, they have apparently been classified in previous lists on the basis of geographical proximity. \ili{Sambe} is moribund, as there were only two speakers over 90 in 2005, and none remain in 2017. The rest have at most a few hundred speakers. All data and analyses given here were the result of fieldwork by the author \citet{Blenchn.d.f}.

The group is here named \ili{Alumic}, after the language with the most speakers, but this term can be regarded as provisional. The \ili{Alumic} languages are now scattered geographically, and isolated among the \ili{Ninzic} (=Plateau IV) languages. The very different sociolinguistic histories may explain their striking morphological diversity. The internal structure of the \ili{Alumic} group is shown in \figref{fig:nomaffplat:5}.

\ili{Alumu}, \ili{Toro} and \ili{Sambe} no longer have functioning noun class systems, but the nouns have transparent fossil prefixes. \ili{Hasha} has developed a highly idiosyncratic system of reduplicating the first syllable of the stem to mark plurality in both nouns and verbs, apparently under the influence of a neighbouring \ili{Chadic} language, \ili{Sha}. \ili{Təsu} has entirely converted to a system of a single plural suffix, with no functioning noun-prefixes. Nonetheless, these can be recovered in part from the existing nouns, especially by comparison with cognate forms in other \ili{Plateau} languages. Although many nouns have zero prefixes, fossil V- and N- prefixes are quite widespread. The most common prefix is \textit{à-} and \textit{ə̀-} is probably its allomorph. \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:43} shows some characteristic examples.

\end{table}


There is no trace of a semantic association for other prefixes. Liquids and non-count nouns show no characteristic morphological pattern.

\ili{Sambe} no longer has a functioning noun-class system, perhaps a consequence of the switch to \ili{Ninzo}. However, it clearly existed until recently and many words were cited with fossil prefixes. Indeed, sometimes a word would be cited in one elicitation with the prefix and again without it, showing the language in transition prior to its inevitable death. The tones marked are best characterised as approximate, with speakers varying between elicitation sessions. Three prefixes can be discerned in the data, \textit{kV}-, \textit{bV}- and \textit{tV}-, each with an underspecified or ‘hollow’ vowel. In some languages this shows concord with the stem vowel, but this does not seem to have been the case with Sambe. 

The most common prefix is \textit{k\`{V}-} in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:14}.

\ili{Sambe} probably also had a nasal prefix which was homorganic with the following consonant, see \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:46}.

Many nouns referring to persons have an \textit{a}- prefix and some which are naturally plural, such as ‘ancestors’ have a \textit{ba}- prefix, see \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:47}.

\begin{table}
\caption{\textit{a/ba-} prefixes in Sambe}
    \label{extab:nomaffplat:47}

‘relations’ 	&  \itshape bàruhwin ninamláni\\
‘ancestors’ 	&  \itshape bàgúgó\\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}    
\end{table}

From this we can conclude that Sambe originally had an \textit{a-/ba}- noun class pair for humans. No other fossil prefixes have any semantic associations, and neither mass nouns nor liquids show any common features. The strong presence of CV- prefixes with underspecified vowels is extremely rare in this area, although common in \ili{Kainji} languages (Blench, Chapter \ref{sec:3} this volume).

\subsection{East}

The three languages constituting Greenberg’s Plateau 6, \ili{Fyem}, \ili{Bo-Rukul} [=\ili{Mabo-Barkul}] and \ili{Horom} were placed together as \ili{Southeastern Plateau} in the Benue-Congo Comparative Wordlist \citet{WilliamsonShimizu1968,Williamson1972}. Although named Southeastern (e.g. in \citealt{CrozierBlench1992}) it is here named '\ili{East Plateau}' as a better reflection of its direction in relation to the Plateau centre of gravity. However, it is highly uncertain that they do indeed form a coherent group as \ili{Bo-Rukul} is very distinct from \ili{Fyem} and \ili{Horom}. In \figref{fig:nomaffplat:1} they have been separated as branches of \ili{Plateau} with a tentative linkage marked. \citet{Nettle1998a} is a sketch grammar of \ili{Fyem}, and \citet{Nettle1998b} short wordlists of all three languages, but \ili{Bo-Rukul} and \ili{Horom} remain virtually unknown (although see \citealt{Blench2003} for their relation with the \ili{Ron} (\ili{Chadic}) languages). Since \ili{Horom} has the most elaborate system of nominal affixing, it is discussed in detail in this section. Data and analysis are based on fieldwork by the author.

Number marking in \ili{Horom} nouns is characterised by a great diversity of strategies. V-/CV- prefix alternation is the most characteristic process and the possibilities are numerous. Of these, the \textit{i-} plural prefix is applied in the majority of cases. The singular and plural class/pairings identified so far are shown in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:17}.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:nomaffplat:17} Singular/plural affix pairings in Horom}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXl}
\lsptoprule
  Singular 	&   Plural 	&   Comment\\
  \midrule
\itshape ø- 	& \itshape à-, bà-, bɛ̀-, ɗì-, ì-, ù- 	& \\
\itshape a- 	& \itshape bà-, i- 	& \\
\itshape ɗi- 	& \itshape a-, bà- 	& \\
\itshape ɗu- 	& \itshape à-, bà-, be- 	& \\
\itshape ì- 	& \itshape bà- 	& \\
\itshape nà- 	& \itshape bɛ̀nɛ̀ 	&  A single example\\
\itshape ò- 	& \itshape bà- 	&  A single example\\
\itshape ù- 	& \itshape à-, bà-,  bɛ̀- 	& \\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
 
\ili{Horom} also demonstrates some striking semantic unities with respect to plural markers. Singulars are diverse, but almost all animals, from mammals to insects, have \textit{i}- plural prefixes. Similarly, nouns referring to persons have a \textit{ba}- prefix (and sometimes a suffix) but with no corresponding singular prefix. Mass nouns and liquids have no defining morphological character. \ili{Horom} shows no evidence for nasal prefixes; in one apparent case the widespread Plateau root for ‘person’ has grammaticalised as an affix.

The most striking typological feature of \ili{Horom} is the evolution of a nominal suffixing system, characterised either by vowels or –NV structures. The singular nouns are diverse, with either zero or a wide array of prefixes. The plurals are all prefixed with \textit{ba}-, and a vocalic or –NV segment. \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:18} on the following page shows the nouns so far recorded with both prefixes and suffixes. 


\ili{Horom} also has ``broken plurals''. In words with stems of CVCCV(C) structure, an epenthetic vowel, either \textit{-i-} or \textit{-ə-}, is inserted between the two syllables of the stem as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:48}.


\begin{table}
\caption{Horom ‘broken’ plurals}
\label{extab:nomaffplat:48}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXl}

 \lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


These may be infixes or simply a phonological extension of the syllable. None of these words are transparent compounds, but this may be their historical origin, in which case each element of the compound would have retained its plural prefix, with the second prefix undergoing centralisation in some environments.

\ili{South Plateau} is named for two language groups, \ili{Jilic} and \ili{Eggonic}, which are here put together. ``Southern'' was applied to \ili{Jilic} alone in \citet{CrozierBlench1992}. \figref{fig:nomaffplat:6} shows this new proposal.

The \ili{Jilic} or \ili{Koro} languages are spoken in scattered communities across a wide swathe of Central Nigeria and this is usually attributed to persistent slave-raiding in the nineteenth centuries. As speakers have lost contact with one another, their languages have rapidly diversified.

\subsubsection{Jilic} %2.8.2 /

\ili{Jilic} consists of at least two languages, \ili{Mijili} [=\ili{Koro of Lafia}] and \ili{Ujijili} [=\ili{Koro} \ili{Huntu}], now separated by a considerable geographic distance, but clearly related \citet{Blenchn.d.g}. There is a microfiched grammar of \ili{Mijili} by \citet{Stofberg1978}, while \ili{Ujijili} is known from an unpublished wordlist. \ili{Koro Ija} and \ili{Koro Zuba}, two languages spoken northwest of Abuja, are said to be nearly intelligible with \ili{Ujijili}, although no language data exists to demonstrate this. This section will focus on \ili{Mijili} as described by \citet{Stofberg1978}, but with additional material from fieldwork in 2003. \ili{Mijili} has a system of number marking on nouns based on prefix alternations. \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:19} is a matrix showing the possible pairings of singular and plural prefixes.

Once allomorphy of the prefixes is taken into account, the number of underlying prefixes is considerably reduced. As elsewhere in Plateau, singular nouns referring to human beings have variable morphology. Many nouns for persons have a former \textit{ɲV}- prefix, now apparently lexicalised, but still in alternation in one root, the word for `young man’ in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:49}.  Plural prefixes in \ili{Mijili} nouns for persons are either \textit{mV}- or \textit{a}-.

\subsubsection{Eggonic} %2.8.3 /

\ili{Eggonic} consists of just two languages, \ili{Eggon} and \ili{Ake}, spoken around Akwanga. These have previously been put together with \ili{Ninzic}, although this is more a supposition based on geography than historical linguistics. The \ili{Eggon} people are numerous and their language is divided into numerous dialects, while \ili{Ake} (=Aike) is spoken in only three villages. Although the languages share enough common glosses to be put together, they are still quite distant from one another. \ili{Eggon} has a limited system of nominal morphology, while \ili{Ake} has lost its system entirely. All data and analyses in this section are based on fieldwork by the author.

\ili{Ake} nouns no longer have morphologically marked plurals, with a few exceptions in the case of persons. However, there is considerable evidence for prior systems of CV prefixes, many of which survive in frozen form preceding the stem. The key to detecting such affixes is external cognates. Many words appear with different prefixes in related languages. Thus, although \ili{Proto-Ake} almost certainly had a \textit{ki-} prefix, in the word \textit{kipindye} ‘village/settlement’ the \textit{ki-} is not a prefix, since it is cognate with forms in remote \ili{Plateau} languages such as \ili{Hyam} \textit{khep}, \ili{Jili} \textit{kúp\`{ɔ̃} }, and the –\textit{ndye} element would then be a compounded element. Such evidence is not available for all the terms with potential affixes, so only more elaborated morphological comparisons will increase certainty. The former V- prefixes often have two distinct tones and may therefore be ultimately of different origins or it may be that this is the result of a now-lost morphophonemic process. However, since they exist in high-low pairs for almost all the hypothetical prefixes reconstructed in \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:20}.

\ili{Ake} has a variety of \textit{kV}- prefixes which constitute possible evidence for an original affix with an underspecified vowel, such as occur both in Sambe (\sectref{sec:nomaffplat:2.6}) and \ili{East Kainji} languages such as Boze (see \citealtv{Blench2018kainjitv}, \sectref{sec:kainji:3.5.2}). Examples are given in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:52}.

An intriguing feature of \ili{Ake} prefixes, not apparently found in related or nearby \ili{Plateau} languages, is semantic clustering around specific segments. Some examples are found in \REF{ex:nomaffplat:53}:

It is conceivable this is related \ili{Bantu} Class 9, \textit{nì}-, for animals, although large salient species in \ili{Ake} do not have an \textit{ŋ-} prefix.

\subsection{Tarokoid} %2.9 /

The \ili{Tarokoid} languages consist of four distinct languages and the \ili{Kwang} cluster. \ili{Tarok} is numerically the most dominant, spoken in a large area around Langtang, while the others are spoken in small communities isolated from one another between Langtang and Jos. \ili{Yangkam} is moribund, spoken only by men over fifty years of age. \figref{fig:nomaffplat:7} shows the internal structure of \ili{Tarokoid}.

   
\begin{figure}

\end{forest}  
\caption{Internal structure of Tarokoid}
\label{fig:nomaffplat:7}
\end{figure} 

Within \ili{Tarokoid} there is a considerable range of nominal morphology. \ili{Tarok} itself has both the most complete prefix system and alliterative concord. \ili{Yangkam} has lost functioning affix alternation but has partially developed a system of reduplicating the initial syllable of the stem. Sur has also lost any functioning affixes without the evolution of a compensatory process, perhaps under the influence of the \ili{Chadic} language \ili{Ngas}. 

\ili{Kwang} marks number with singular/plural prefix pairings, but these are extremely reduced compared with \ili{Tarok} or \ili{Pe} \citet{Blenchn.d.h}. With very few exceptions, all plurals are marked with an \textit{à}- prefix.  \ili{Kwang} has a small number of nouns where plurality is marked with a tone-change, Low/High or Mid/High, and some irregular plurals which may be examples of residual consonant mutation. Changes in the stem vowel occur in the plurals of some lexemes connected with persons. \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:21} shows the nominal prefixes of \ili{Kwang}, and by far the most common singular prefix is ø- and plural \textit{à-}.

\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab:nomaffplat:21} Kwang nominal prefixes}

\lspbottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


However, the large number of palatalised and labialised stems in \ili{Kwang} suggests that \textit{i-} and \textit{u-} prefixes were formerly present. By far the most common singular/ plural alternation is \textit{ø-/à-}, as shown in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:57}.

\begin{table}

\end{table}


\ili{Kwang} seems to have deleted the prefixes on singular nouns very extensively, as most of these now show only the root with no fossil morpheme. Nouns referring to persons all take \textit{à}- plurals, but the singulars have no distinctive features. Some nouns copy the number marker at the end of the word, and assimilate the stem vowel if it is not the same –\textit{a} as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:58}.

The next most common pairing is \textit{ǹ-/á-} as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:59}.

\ili{Kwang} also has occasional stem-initial consonant mutation as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:60}.

\end{table}



Despite the example of ‘blood’ there is no association between mass nouns or liquids and nasal prefixes.

The noun classes of \ili{Tarok} have been described in \citet{Sibomana1981} with additional material in \citet{Longtau2008}. \citet{Sibomana1981} sets up 6 singular and plural noun classes for \ili{Tarok} (\figref{figtab:nomaffplat:22}).

\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{figtab:nomaffplat:22} Tarok noun-class pairings}
\begin{tabular}{lllll}

\end{tabular}  
% \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/nomaffplat-img8.png}
\end{figure}
 

The order of the numbers seems less than ideal, but since it is reprised in \citet{Longtau2008} it is also used here. Historically, these pairings must result from the merger of a more complex system, as in many singular/plural pairs there are changes in the stem tone. Some of these seem to show semantic correlations, others do not, again suggesting class merger. \ili{Tarok} also has a rich inventory of adjectives with concordial prefixes. Nasal prefixes are homorganic with the following consonant, with \textit{m-} preceding bilabials and \textit{n-} all others. 

Persons in \ili{Tarok} are almost exclusively in Class 1/2, i.e. with a \textit{u-/o-} prefix alternation, as shown in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:61}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Tarok \textit{u-/o-} prefix alternations}

There is a strong tendency for mass nouns, liquids and abstracts to have the unpaired homorganic \textit{N-} prefix as in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:62}.

No other semantic set, such as large animals, trees or body parts, shows a tendency to cluster around a particular prefix pairing.

\subsection{Eloyi} %2.10 /

The \ili{Eloyi} or \ili{Afo} language is spoken in about twenty villages in Nassarawa State, Nigeria. The principle sources on the language are \citet{Mackay1964} and \citet{Armstrong1964,Armstrong1983,Armstrong1984}.\footnote{Despite the title of the 1984 publication, this is about Eloyi.} The classification of \ili{Eloyi} has been disputed, all the more so because the lexical database for comparison has been so weak. All the preliminary sources classified \ili{Eloyi} as Plateau 2, i.e. together \ili{Izere}, \ili{Tyap} etc. (e.g. \citealt{Greenberg1963,WilliamsonShimizu1968,deWolf1971}). \citet{Armstrong1983} set out the case for classifying \ili{Eloyi} as \ili{Idomoid}, which is a \ili{West Benue-Congo} or \ili{Volta-Niger} subgroup, classified together with \ili{Yoruba}, \ili{Igbo}, \ili{Nupe} and \il{Edo@Ẹdo}Ẹdo. However, in Armstrong’s (\citeyear{Armstrong1984}: 29) final published discussion of the subject he expresses some doubts, concluding “Eloyi does not now seem as close to \ili{Idoma} as it did when only Varvil’s list was available”. \ili{Eloyi} has a rich system of alternating nominal prefixes, in contrast to the remainder of \ili{Idomoid}, and is provisionally treated here as \ili{Plateau}, though with significant influence from \ili{Idomoid}. The analysis here is based on the cited published sources, and an unpublished wordlist collected by Barau Kato at the request of the author \citet{Blenchn.d.i}.

Despite the complex affix-pairings, many words have zero prefixes, perhaps due to the impact of extensive bilingualism with \ili{Idomoid} languages. Many alternations have only one or two cases so far recorded, which makes setting up the system highly provisional. \tabref{tab:nomaffplat:23} shows the nominal prefix pairings in Eloyi.

\textit{kV}- prefixes are probably the most common in \ili{Eloyi} singulars and \textit{lV}- for plurals. Although usually some type of stem harmony would be expected to operate there is no evidence for this in Eloyi. 


\ili{Eloyi} noun-class pairings do not show much semantic clustering. Most nouns referring to persons have diverse singulars, and plurals in \textit{a}- or \textit{e}-. Mother and father have an exceptional class prefix pair which may reflect the \ili{Niger-Congo} persons class seen in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:63}. There is no evidence for a distinctive morphology for non-count nouns and no trace of nasal prefixes.

\section{Conclusion: Plateau nominal affixing} %3. /

The numerous examples illustrate the problems of making any generalisations about nominal affixes in \ili{Plateau} and only weak conclusions can be drawn about its relationship with other branches of \ili{Benue-Congo}. This represents a common problem of historical linguistics in such a significant contact zone. Traces of prefixes familiar from \ili{Bantu} and \ili{Niger-Congo} are found scattered across the family, and in the light of external data it might seem likely that these were present in \ili{Proto-Plateau}. However, on the basis of synchronic data in \ili{Plateau} alone it would be rash to reconstruct them. Taking the data as a whole we can conclude that: 

\largerpage
\begin{enumerate}
\item[a)] \ili{Plateau} languages originally had a rich noun class system with CV- and V- prefixes and alliterative concord
\item[b)] A wave of renewal and analogical re-alignment led to many of the CV- prefixes disappearing or becoming unproductive and replaced by a much smaller set of V- prefixes.
\item[c)] There is some evidence for underspecified vowels in CV- prefixes showing concord with stem vowels although this is too rare to be conclusive.
\item[d)] There is evidence for a class pair for persons, probably \textit{V-/bV-}, although the segment in the singular prefix are less certain (e.g. Tables \ref{extab:nomaffplat:33} and \ref{extab:nomaffplat:37}). This can be compared with the \ili{Niger-Congo} person class.
\item[e)] \ili{Proto-Plateau} almost certainly had an unpaired nasal class marking liquids, mass nouns and abstracts, corresponding to \ili{Niger-Congo} (e.g. examples 14, 34). Unlike \ili{Kainji}, this is rarely realised as \textit{ma}- and several branches of Plateau have \textit{nV}-. \ili{Ndun} in \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:34}  does display \textit{ma-, me-, and m-.} Other unpaired classes exhibit quite different segments which may be innovative. 
\item[f)] There is strong evidence that \ili{Proto-Plateau} had \textit{N}- prefixes, homorganic with the following consonant, and present in most branches. However, there is no evidence for any consistent semantic association.
\item[g)] There is weak evidence that the \ili{Bantu} Class 9 prefix, \textit{nì}-, existed in early \ili{Plateau} (cf. \tabref{extab:nomaffplat:38}).
\end{enumerate}

Based on the synchronic evidence from \ili{Plateau}, the connection with \ili{Niger-Congo} noun classes remains tenuous. Only the non-count nouns and the person class show similarities and even these are obscured by innovative affixes. Similarly, there is no single affix alternation that provides evidence for the genetic unity of Plateau. This can only be deduced from lexical isoglosses
(e.g. in \citealt{Blench2000wocal}).
The paper presents a summary of what is known about number marking strategies on nouns in the \ili{Plateau} languages. Further work will enrich the picture, but it is unlikely to contribute to a coherent reconstruction, as affix renewal has been very extensive.
