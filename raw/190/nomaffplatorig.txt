Nominal affixes and number marking in the Plateau languages of Central Nigeria 
Roger M. Blench

ABSTRACT
The Plateau branch consists of between sixty and eighty languages spoken in central Nigeria, spreading from Lake Shiroro to the banks of the Benue River. A major branch of East Benue-Congo, proto-Plateau is usually considered to have a system of alternating nominal affixes marking number combined with alliterative concord. The paper presents an overall internal classification and then reviews the evidence for affix systems by subgroup, taking a specific language as an exemplar, with a view to linking these to broader hypotheses about Niger-Congo nominal classes. It appears that Plateau has undergone extensive affix renewal, and thus only fragments of any more coherent system are still present. Plateau languages originally had a rich noun class system with CV- and V- prefixes and alliterative concord, but a wave of renewal and analogical re-alignment led to many of the CV- prefixes disappearing or becoming unproductive and replaced by a much smaller set of V- prefixes

1. Introduction: Plateau languages
The Plateau branch consists of between sixty and eighty languages spoken in central Nigeria, spreading from Lake Shiroro to the banks of the Benue River (Figure 1). Although most Plateau populations are small (2-10,000 speakers), there are probably more than a million speakers of Plateau languages, with the bulk of the numbers made up from large groups such as Berom and Eggon. Some Plateau languages, such as Sambe and Yangkam, are moribund and others are severely threatened, such as Ayu. 
Plateau languages represent one of the four major branches of East Benue-Congo outside Bantoid, together with Kainji, Jukunoid and Cross River. Internally, they are divided into a large number of subgroups, whose inter-relations are not well understood. Plateau languages remain extremely poorly studied, with no complete grammar or dictionary for any language except Berom (which is in French and thus inaccessible to Nigerians). Basic overviews of their ethnography and ethnic distribution can be found in Temple (1922), Meek (1925, 1931), Gunn (1953, 1956) and Crozier & Blench (1992).
The most striking feature of Plateau is its morphological and typological diversity. It is usually assumed that proto-Plateau would have had a system of paired nominal prefixes with semantic associations and alliterative concord, similar to but probably less elaborate than Bantu. However, these systems have collapsed and been rebuilt or in some cases disappeared completely. Compensatory morphology has evolved, including highly complex consonantal inventories and rich tone-systems. Synchronically, Plateau languages display systems of consonant mutation, contrastive length, as well as palatalisation, labialisation, lateralisation of initial consonants and combinations of all these.

The origin of these diverse outcomes may lie in the characteristic marriage systems within the Plateau region. These often involved linguistic exogamy, which, combined with marital instability, resulted in the pervasive multilingualism which almost certainly played a role in the evolution of complex ‘mixed’ systems of number marking. Plateau marriage systems are discussed in considerable detail in Muller (1982). Many different systems co-existed, and there is evidence that when absolute numbers of speakers were much lower (often as little as 500 per language in the pre-colonial era) this principle of outmarriage was strongly enforced.
Plateau languages are assumed to form part of the broader unit represented by East Benue-Congo (Williamson 1971, 1989; Williamson & Blench 2000). The earliest source for Plateau, Koelle (1854) gives wordlists of Ham (Hyam), Koro of Lafia (Migili) and Yasgua (Yeskwa). Westermann (1927) assigned the few languages for which he had data to a ‘Benue-Cross’ family, corresponding to present-day East Benue-Congo, although later in Westermann & Bryan (1952) these were classified as ‘isolated units’. However, the modern subclassification of Plateau derives principally from the work of Joseph Greenberg (1963) who proposed dividing Westermann’s ‘Benue-Cross’ languages into seven co-ordinate groups (including modern-day Kainji and Jukunoid). With numerous emendations and additions these have been reprised in almost all subsequent works (notably Williamson and Shimizu 1968; Williamson 1971, 1972, 1989; Maddieson 1972; Gerhardt 1989; Crozier and Blench 1992; Blench 1998, 2000a). Blench (ined.) reflects the most recent understanding of Plateau subgrouping.
Comparative studies of number marking in Plateau are scarce; Bouquiaux (1967) represents an initial attempt to discern commonalties across a small number of languages. Some Plateau languages retain complex systems of nominal affixes and alliterative concord, notably Kulu and other members of the northwest cluster and Tarok. However, many languages, such as Cara and the Ninzic cluster, include some affix alternation as part of a repertoire of number marking strategies, while subgroups such as Ndunic and Ake, have completely lost these systems. Other languages, such as Izere, have systems which look elaborate at first sight, but when segmental and tonal allomorphs are taken into account, the underlying number of pairings is considerably reduced. The existence of these systems certainly suggests that alternating affixes and concord were a feature of proto-Plateau, but actual segmental correspondences between affixes are few, pointing to a continuing process of renewal. Plateau also has frequent nasal prefixes, as well as numerous examples of unproductive nasals preceding C1 of the stem (Miehe 1991). Some of these are reflected more widely in other branches of Benue-Congo or even further afield in Kwa. However, the correspondences between noun classes and semantic subsets (humans, trees, animals, paired things) characteristic of Bantu are more tenuous.
The analytic challenge of Plateau is to account for synchronic number marking systems through the lens of the erosion of affix alternation. In the light of this, the confident assertions of authors such as De Wolf (1971) in reconstructing the prefixes of proto-Benue-Congo seem very optimistic. Such reconstructed forms reflect a prior knowledge of Bantu and a large pool of miscellaneous data from which exemplars can be selectively chosen. This paper1 is an overview of nominal affixing in the Plateau languages, based principally on my own fieldwork materials.2 It describes the systems in individual subgroups and then asks what evidence these provide for the situation in proto-Plateau.
None of the authors who have classified Plateau languages have presented evidence for their classifications. This is not a criticism; faced with large arrays of data it is easier to set out what appears to be the case impressionistically than to write a monograph demonstrating it. The series of publications on Plateau subgroups, especially Plateau II and IV, by Gerhardt (1969a, b, 1971, 1972/3a, b, 1973/4, 1974, 1983a, b, 1988a, b, 1989, 1994) assume the boundaries of these groups. A particular issue in the internal classification of Plateau and Jukunoid is the notion of a ‘Benue’ grouping. Shimizu (1975a:415) proposed that some branches of Plateau should be classified with Jukunoid. In particular, he argued that Eggon (and by implication the other Plateau V languages, including Nungu and Yeskwa) and Tarokoid (at that time consisting only of Yergam (=Tarok) and Basherawa (=Yaŋkam)) formed a group together with Jukunoid. This emerged from his lexicostatistical tables and was further supported by five isoglosses, the words for ‘drink’, ‘tail’, ‘meat’, ‘fire’, and ‘four’. This expanded group he christened ‘Benue’. Gerhardt (1983b) questioned Shimizu’s hypothesis noting both that his own lexicostatistical work (Gerhardt & Jockers 1981) did not support this, and casting doubt on the five isoglosses proposed by Shimizu. The ‘Benue’ group continued in a sort of half-life, appearing in Gerhardt (1989) as a subgrouping of Jukunoid and Tarokoid against the rest of Plateau. Blench (2005) has presented evidence that there is a genuine boundary between Plateau and Jukunoid, drawing on lexical and morphological evidence.
This uncertainty is a reflection of a more general problem, the evidence for a bounded group ‘Plateau’ in opposition to Kainji, Jukunoid, Dakoid or Mambiloid, other members of the Benue-Congo complex. The relationships between Plateau languages, their coherence as a grouping and their links with Jukunoid and Kainji remain undetermined. Rowlands (1962) was the first to suggest that there was a dichotomy between certain languages of the Jos area, which he linked to West Kainji, and the remainder, but his short wordlists were far from constituting linguistic proof. Comparative analysis has produced some tentative evidence for isoglosses defining Plateau, but so far no phonological or morphological innovations that would define the group have been proposed. Some of this diversity is undoubtedly due to long-term interactions with the mosaic of Chadic languages also occurring on the Jos Plateau (Blench 2003).
With these caveats, Figure 2 presents a new subclassification of Plateau, within the context of East Benue-Congo. Evidence for this subgrouping is presented in Blench (in press). The majority of evidence is lexical, but some subgroups, such as Northwest, clearly also share considerable common elements in the noun-class system. This ‘tree’ is clearly not final, as there are too many co-ordinate branches and too little internal structure. But until further analysis is undertaken, provisional versions of Plateau which do not promote too many unwarranted assumptions are the best that can be produced.
 
Figure 2: Benue-Congo languages: proposed classification
This paper is organised using these Plateau subgroups and listed approximately left to right. The summary Table 1 also gives a list of all known Plateau languages.
The great majority of material presented here is either from my own fieldwork since 1980, from manuscript sources, with a relatively small amount from published work, cited in the reference list. Where no source is cited it can be taken this is my own data. All original wordlists can be found on my website3. Some of the earliest data is not tone-marked, and the segmental transcription may be less reliable. Most Plateau languages have a three-level tone system and by convention the mid-tone is not marked. Therefore, if the data is tone-marked, a vowel without a tone is deemed to be mid. Where a standardised orthography exists, for example in the case of Mada, only the high tone is unmarked. I have noted deviations from the standard tone marking in relation to relevant examples.
The sample wordlist is usually five hundred items and of these some 350 are nouns with singular and plural recorded. Allowing for entries that cannot be elicited, the nouns available for analysis amount to around 300. Where the data has not been collected by the author, the sample may be smaller, whereas in the case of dictionaries prepared by the author, for example Berom, Izere, Mada and Tarok the sample is usually well over a thousand. For most languages only singular/plural pairs are available, but where a grammar sketch has been prepared, we also have an overview of the concord system. The reader should refer to the original wordlist for examples of the noun-class pairings, where these are summarised in the tables below.
Plateau languages exhibit extensive allomorphy in their nominal affix systems. Allomorphs are here defined as ‘one of two or more complementary morphs which manifest a morpheme in its different phonological or morphological environments’. In Plateau, tonal allomorphs are common, because the tone of the prefix may be driven by the tone of the stem, thus the V of a CV prefix may have one of three tone levels, as for example in Kulu. Sometimes claims of allomorphy in less-well-studied languages are only educated guesses, based on parallels with better known languages. The term alternation is used to apply to the change in prefix on a stem marking number, i.e. singular and either one or two plurals. Throughout the text, the tables present a summary of the prefix alternations occurring in the data, mostly wordlists. This is not ideal, as we have no evidence for the patterns of concord in many languages, but it provides a preliminary guide to the synchronic system.
2. Plateau languages by subgroup
Table 1 shows a comprehensive list of Plateau languages, by subgroup, and a summary of the system of number-marking, as far as it is known. Where there is a published reference on a specific language, it is given, although I do not always agree with the analysis and the text presents my own hypothesis. No entry in the reference column means the summary is based on my own fieldwork. The names of the branches are proposed by the author, since the classification is at variance with previous proposals in many areas. Further justification can be found in Blench (in press).

2.1 Northwest Plateau
Northwest Plateau consists of Eda/Edra, Acro-Obiro [=Kuturmi], (i) Kulu, Idon, Doka and Iku-Gora-Ankwe. No new data has been published since this group was set up, although a wordlist of Kulu has been circulated (Moser 1982, analysed in Seitz 1993) and Shimizu (1996) has posted a grammar sketch on the Internet. Recent interest in Ẹda [=Kadara] language has resulted in an unpublished dialect survey, a preliminary alphabet book and the launching of an alphabet chart in 2009. Kadara is known to its speakers as ‘Ẹda’ and there is a closely related lect, Ẹdra (which is presumably the source of the common Hausa name). Two other lects for which information is recorded, Ẹjẹgha and Ẹhwa4, correspond to Idon and the Iku-Gora-Ankwe clusters (as named in the Benue-Congo Comparative Wordlist in Williamson & Shimizu 1968; Williamson 1972). The wordlists are so different from each other and from Ẹda that they clearly deserve separate language status. Northwest Plateau remains a high priority for further research.
Table 2 shows the singular/plural prefix pairings recorded in Kulu including tonal variants, based on Moser (1982) and Seitz (1993). A postulated ‘underlying’ prefix is given together with its allomorphs. The mid-front vowel shows harmony with the stem-vowel. The bracketed nasals in the plural prefixes show their sporadic appearance. They are homorganic with the following consonant and only follow /i/.

Tonal variation in prefixes is driven by the stem-tone (as in many Plateau languages, cf. Blench 2001) and the different surface tones do not in themselves mark distinct pairs marked for number. The numerous forms of a gV- prefix presumably point to these all originally having a single underspecified vowel which has gradually diverged5. The presence of an underspecified vowel in the V of a prefix is very common in the East Kainji languages with which Kulu is in contact and it is possible this is a borrowing.

Kulu has frequent doubled /l/ in stem-initial position, assumed to derive from nasal prefixes which have been first fossilised and then assimilated to an initial lateral. For example (1):
(1)  	Doubled /l/ in stem-initial position 

gɛ́-llam		‘water’
	gu-llúrú		‘storm’
gɛ-llán		‘chin’
	gɛ̀-llìbì		‘hyena’

Semantic associations in Kulu are weak, but the majority of nouns for persons show E-/bE- prefix alternation. Most domestic animals have a gV- singular prefix but no consistent plural marking. Wild animals, on the other hand, almost all have their singular and plural forms distinguished only by tonal differences in the stem. Trees, body parts, abstracts and even mass nouns do not form consistent sets marked by paired affixes. The ni- prefix for noun plurals is uncommon and surprisingly, it is strongly correlated with household items as in (2):

However, Kulu does operate a principle of using prefixes to assign semantics, such as the parts of a tree, by means of prefixes, as for example in (3):

2.2 Beromic
The term ‘Beromic’ has been adopted here to cover former Plateau 2 languages. Beromic now consists of Berom, Iten, Cara and two closely related lects, Shall and Zwall, geographically distant in Bauchi State. The principal publications on Berom are Bouquiaux (1970, 2001) and Kuhn & Dusu (1985), and on Iten, Bouquiaux (1964). Recent unpublished materials are dictionaries of Berom and Iten. Cara (Teriya) was reported in a mimeo paper by Shimizu (1975b) who first proposed a link with Berom. Shall and Zwall were previously classified with the Ninzic languages (Plateau 4), but are better placed with Beromic6. Beromic languages show a broad range of number-marking systems, although none have a full noun-class system and Shall-Zwall has lost all nominal affixing, perhaps under the influence of Chadic. A summary of Beromic number marking is shown in Table 3:

Berom itself has a complex internal structure. Central Berom includes the Du dialect described by Bouquiaux (1970, 2001) as well as both Vwang (Vom) and Ryom (Riyom). The speakers of Vwang are the most numerous, but the main dialect used for literacy and bible translation is the Eastern dialect, roughly centred on Foron, spoken by only a minority. The other minority dialect is Rim, south and east of the main centres. Data on Berom presented here is based on long-term fieldwork on the Foron dialect and shows marked differences with the Du of Bouquiaux.
Berom noun pluralisation strategies are extremely varied. The most common are:
a)	prefix addition or alternation
b)	tone-raising
c)	(de)labialisation
d)	consonant alternation
e)	number marking in verbal nouns replicating corresponding verbal plurals

In some cases, two procedures can be applied to mark a plural, suggesting the dynamics of renewal. The great majority of Berom singular nouns have no prefix, while nouns that are marked for plural, the be- prefix is predominant. Berom shows ‘echo’ concord, where a small subset of concordial adjectives exactly copy the nominal prefix of the noun they qualify. Where the noun has no prefix, the adjective shows no concord. Berom also has just three suppletive plurals in a dictionary which includes more than 2000 nouns. Due to this relatively large database, it is possible to estimate the frequency of nominal prefix alternations in Eastern Berom seen in Table 4.

===============================================
Tone-marks show the most characteristic tone for this class, with mid-tone unmarked. However, there are numerous unexplained exceptions, which may reflect interaction with the stem-vowel. ra- is not attested synchronically as a productive prefix, since all singular nouns in current Berom with stem-initial ra- have a zero singular prefix and a plural prefix be-. However, many words have ra- as a first syllable, such as rato ‘head’ where the ra- is not historically part of the root, because –to is widely attested across Benue-Congo for ‘head’.
The alternation wo-/be-, notably attested in (4), the ethnonym for the Berom people, is probably not originally a noun class pair. wo is a personal pronoun and be- a generic plural marker.

(4)   Wòrom  ‘Berom person’       	Berom   ‘Berom people’

The labial and palatal infixes -w- and -y- almost certainly originally derive from u- and i- prefixes which have been incorporated into the stem, as in many other Plateau languages. Kießling (2010) has described analogous processes in the languages of the Grassfields of Cameroun. Tonal changes accompany number marking suggest that the tone of the lost prefix vowel affected the stem tone of the noun.
The nasal prefixes form a complex set. It is most likely there is a diminutive marker ne- which shows up both as a plural prefix and unpaired in non-count nouns, as well as in ke-/ne- alternations marking small entities in (5). The ke- is probably cognate with Bantu ka- which has a similar diminutive function (Maho 1999: 88).

2.3 West-Central
2.3.1 General
West-Central Plateau consists of what used to be known as the ‘Southern Zaria’ languages. Published and manuscript sources include (Koelle 1854; Gerhardt 1971, 1974, 1983a, 1984; Adwiraah & Hagen 1983; Adwiraah 1989; McKinney, Carol 1979, 1983; McKinney, Norris 1984, 1990; Joy Follingstad 1991; Carl Follingstad, n.d.). Although these languages are clearly linked, no published evidence supports their coherence as a group. The languages Nandu [=Ndun] and Tari [=Shakara] were listed in Crozier & Blench (1992) as part of this group. This is erroneous; Ndun-Shakara, together with the newly discovered Nyeng, form their own group, Ndunic (§2.4). The West-Central Plateau languages are a coherent geographical clustering and undoubtedly show numerous links with one another, but their genetic unity is unproven. Gerhardt (1983a: 67 ff.) presents a comparative wordlist showing cognates between Rigwe, Izere and Tyap. However, with both new insights into the phonology of these languages, and in particular the large number of lects still unrecorded at that period, a new comparative analysis is still to be undertaken. Figure 3 presents the known groups of West-Central Plateau as a flat array.

Figure 3: West-Central Plateau subgroups

2.3.2 Rigwe 
The Rigwe language is spoken southeast of Jos. It is notable for an extremely complex phonology (Anon 2006). Any former system of extensive alternating affixes has been replaced by a standard pluralising prefix or by a variety of tonal changes. Analysis of Rigwe was undertaken by the author in co-operation with Daniel Gya. Table 5 lists the strategies for plural marking in Rigwe with their allomorphs:

==================================================
Class II nouns have a ɾV-/Ǹ- alternation. rV- is realized as ɾi- when the stem vowel is front, and as ɾu- when the stem-vowel is back. Ǹ- is realised as ɲ̀- before palatals ɲ- and j- and as ǹ- elsewhere. (10) presents examples of the operation of this class:

As the glosses show, the nasal prefix is associated with human and animal body parts, which seems to be innovative. The Class III alternation in Rigwe is ø-/Ǹ-, where Ǹ- is homorganic with the following consonant, realised as ɲ- before palatals, ŋ- before velars and n- elsewhere. Only /a/, /e/ and /u/ have been recorded as stem vowels in Class III. Unlike the other classes, the stem tone changes and is always low, regardless of the tone in the singular. (11) presents examples of this class. This class is equally associated with body parts but is otherwise miscellaneous.

Rigwe has innovated in nominal affixing to such an extent that no obvious connection with postulated classes for either Niger-Congo or Bantu can be discerned.
2.3.3 Tyapic
The Tyapic languages are named for Tyap, or Kataf in older sources. The group consists of six languages (Tyap, Gworok, Atakar, Kacicere, Sholyo, and Kafancan), with the closely related Jju7. Only Tyap itself is well-described (Follingstad 1991). The prefixed elements appear to be innovative and consist of a(Ca-) and its allomorphs. However, the noun is also followed a variety of alternating CV suffixes. These are almost certainly noun-class affixes, now placed after the stem. Table 6 shows a summary of Tyap nominal affixes and concord as well as examples of nominal pairs.
The elements marked ‘post-concord’ in Table 6 were almost certainly former CV prefixes which have been copied at the end of the word, a procedure attested elsewhere in Niger-Congo. They are written in the orthography as distinct words as they do not show phonological merger with the root they follow.

Plurals reduplicate by doubling the first syllable of the root. Thus (13):

ə̀kwənka		‘tree’			ə̀kə̀kwə̀n nà 	‘trees’
Classes 1/2, with the suffixes wu/ba, probably corresponds to Bantu class 1/2 and includes many Tyap nouns for human beings. Class 9, which is unpaired, includes liquids such as ə̀sə̀khwôt nà ‘water’ and ə̀bààn na ‘milk’ which is semantically similar to Niger-Congo Class 6. The homorganic plural nasal prefix in Class 8a is possibly to be compared with Bantu Class 6 where it is the plural of Class 5 ‘paired things’, e.g. mbwàk na ‘hands’.
Follingstad (1991: 79) shows that concord in Tyap is much reduced with only a few adjectives and lower numerals showing any agreement. The agreement is of the ‘direct-copy’ or ‘echo’ type, where the numeral has the same prefix as the noun it agrees with.
2.3.4 Izeric
The Izeric languages consist of northwest Izere, northeast Izere, Cèn, Ganàng and Fəràn8. The language which is best-known is Izere of Fobur but wordlists suggest that the affix pairings in the other languages are broadly similar9. Blench (2000b) is a more detailed description of Izere number marking. Nominal plurals in Izere of Fobur are formed in four ways:
a. affix alternation
b. stem-tone alternation
c. deverbal nouns that copy the alternations of verb stems
d. suppletion

Affix alternation and stem-tone alternation are frequently combined producing a very large number of plural formations. Izere of Fobur has a relatively restricted set of segmental noun-class prefixes. Table 7 shows Izere nominal affix pairings:

		=========================================
Tone cannot be specified for most Izere prefixes, since it reflects the tone of the stem. The unpaired mass noun prefix, corresponding to Niger-Congo Class 6, is always low tone. ka- and its allomorph ki-, realised when the noun stem contains a palatal, can function as a diminutive prefix. Paired ka- and ku- were probably allomorphs of one another historically, since there is a tendency for stem-vowels following ka- to be front or central and those following ku- to be back. However, exceptions now abound, suggesting a historical class split. 
Izere has an unpaired nà- prefix for liquids and solids which probably corresponds to the ma- prefix in Niger-Congo, shown in (14).

2.3.5 Hyamic
The Hyamic languages are spoken between Kwoi and Nok, southwest of Jos and are now central to the prehistoric Nok culture. The members of the Hyamic cluster are as follows:
Cori
Hyam cluster (incl. Kwyeny, Yaat, Sait, Dzar, Hyam of Nok)
Shamang
Zhire-Shang

Many of these languages are very poorly known and existing descriptions are tonally and phonologically inadequate (e.g. Dihoff 1976; Jockers 1982).

Hyam has a wide range of strategies to mark nominal plurals. Analysis of Hyamic languages is based solely on fieldwork by the author. The most important are shown in Table 8:

  =============================================
Transcription of tone is best described as schematic; Hyam has a highly complex tone-system which is far from being fully understood, but which includes multiple contour tones, combining different levels of the underlying three-tone system.
All of these point to the former existence of nominal prefix alternation and palatalisation and labialisation to incorporated i- and u- prefixes. The ma- prefix on ‘leaf’ is exceptional and not linked with the Class 6 prefix. The mò- prefix is applied to most humans, large animals and reptiles, but not other animals, and a small scatter of miscellaneous lexemes. The na-/fu- singular/ plural alternation is only recorded for a few nouns related to occupations as in (15), and may be some sort of reassigned relative marker (‘one who’) rather than a relic nominal affix.
(15)  na-/fu- singular/ plural alternation

na-hywes		‘witch	’		fu-hywes	‘witches’
na-kyat kpyo	‘sorcerer’		fu-kyat kpyo	‘sorcerers’
na-naa		‘blacksmith’		fu-naa 	‘blacksmiths’

Almost all verbs and adjectives have obligatory plural forms and many undergo the same phonological shifts or mutations as nouns. Adjectives agree in number, i.e. where the noun is plural, the plural adjective is obligatory, but they do not show the type of alliterative concord characteristic of noun-class languages.
The Shang language, while lexically Hyamic, has a nominal affix system resembling Tinɔr and similar Koro languages (§2.3.7)10. Shang has a reduced system of nominal affixes. The main noun-class pairs are between zero affixes in the singular and plural a- and i- prefixes seen in Table 9. Rare plural prefixes include ka-, u- and ru-. No singular affix, either productive or fossil, has been recorded. Some nouns referring to persons have a singular/plural alternation nè-/fú- (as in Hyam) but these are probably not old affixes but compounded terms for ‘person’. The tone on the vowel of the plural affix always appears to be low.

Semantic correlations are not very clear for most of these pairings. However, there is a strong predominance of body parts with the ka- plural affix. Most nouns relating to persons have an a- prefix in the plural, but since this is statistically the most common prefix, this may not be significant. There is no trace of nasal prefixes.
2.3.6 Gyongic
Gyongic is the closest relative of Hyamic and consists of two languages, Gyong [Kagoma] and Angan [Kamanton]. Neither language is well-known but there is a description of Gyong which includes information on noun-classes (Hagen 1988). According to this, Gyong marks plurals with prefix alternation, palatalisation alternation and tone. The data tables below follow her presentation. The reduced prefix system is as follows in (16):

2.3.7 Koro
The Koro cluster consists of five languages spoken in Central Nigeria, north of Keffi. The published literature is sparse and based on limited data (Gerhardt 1972b; Goroh 2000). All the material presented on the Koro languages is based on fieldwork by the author. Figure 4 shows a tentative outline classification of the languages in the Koro cluster.

Figure 4: Classification of the Koro languages

Waci has retained a much richer noun-class system than any of the related languages, although it is in decay – see Table 10. There is a strong tendency to cite some types of nouns, especially those to do with living things, without a singular prefix and to reduce the pluralisation marker to an a- prefix. Moreover, there are a very large number of singular/plural pairings, many of them only occurring once suggesting a complex process of re-analysis is under way. Some prefixes have several allomorphs probably prefiguring class merger. There is some semantic correlation with prefix pairings: for example, humans commonly have u-/bV- prefixes and animals most often ì/i-, but the correlation is far from perfect.

	=========================================
There is no evidence for a distinctive mass noun prefix. Some liquids, such as water (bàmɪ́) and blood (bèʤí) show no singular/plural prefix alternation, while others, such as tears, saliva and urine, have diverse singular/plural affix pairs.
The bV- plural prefix almost always marks persons and is usually, but not always paired with u- singular (20). The vowel is underspecified and very often copies the stem vowel, although b + high vowel (i.e. bi- and bu-) is apparently not permitted:

One of the most striking alternations is gV-/rV-, which does not seem to have any immediate parallel in other Koro languages. The -V- in gV- can be any vowel except the high back vowels. The vowel quality in the gV- prefix partly reflects stem vowels although the correlation is not perfect. Similarly, most plurals have rV- with a few exceptions (27). Some yV- prefixes, such as ‘faeces’ in (26) may well be allomorphs of gV- to judge by the rV- plurals.
The Waci nominal affix system seems to have undergone major renewal. Apart from a class pair for persons and a rather weak animal class, there is no evidence for an unpaired non-count noun prefix and no evidence for semantically clustered prefix pairs elsewhere.

2.4 Ndunic (=Ahwai) 
Ndunic is a new name proposed here for the languages previously called ‘Nandu-Tari’. Existing sources list two languages, but a third language, Ningon, was first recorded in 2003. The Ndunic languages are spoken in a small area southwest of Fadan Karshi. The correct names for these languages are Ndun (Nandu), Shakara (Tari) and Ningon. The languages are extremely close to one another. The Ndunic peoples have recently adopted the name ‘Ahwai’ as a cover term for all three languages (Rueck et al. 2008). Shakara has a much reduced set of nominal affixes, but Ndun has numerous nominal singular/plural affix pairs. All the tables for Ndunic languages are based on fieldwork by the present author. The main attested noun-class pairings of Ndun are shown in Table 11.
However, there are also numerous plurals created by tonal change and by presence and absence of labialisation and palatalisation. Sporadic nasalisation appears between the stem and the prefix as a result of fossil nominal prefixes, although Ndun still preserves a few productive nasal prefixes. Ndun has many noun-class pairings that only occur once, in part due to the underspecified vowels. The tones are too insecurely marked to be sure that there are no additional contrasts on the V- prefixes.

		===============================
Palatalisation can be applied to almost any initial consonant in singular/plural formation, often combined with primary affix alternation as in (28). The likely historical explanation is that there was an initial i- prefix which was incorporated into the stem and then a new plural affix (ironically sometimes a new i- prefix) was applied subsequently.

In addition there are many nouns with initial homorganic nasals (m-, n-, ŋ-) which seem to have been incorporated during an earlier wave of prefix incorporation.

These are probably the traces of former prefixes which have moved to final position and have almost lost their class pair alternation. Semantic correlations with noun-class affix pairings are weak at best. The e-/be- prefix pair includes many nouns referring to persons (33):

However, where mV- appears as a plural number marker it seems to show no semantic correlation. No other Ndun prefixes show any tendency to reflect semantic classes such as body parts, trees or salient animals.
Shakara now has a much reduced system, but proto-Ndunic clearly had a wide range of nominal affix pairs, with fragmentary evidence for a suffix alternation to do with persons. Nasal prefixes were clearly very common but have become so generalised across the system it is now difficult to discern what part they may have played in the original affix alternations.
2.5 Ninzic
Ninzic, formerly Plateau IV, is probably the most difficult group to characterise and weak data on several languages make it unclear whether certain peripheral languages really belong to it. The name Ninzic is introduced here, reflecting the element nin-, which is part of many ethnonyms. The Ninzic languages are spoken south of Fadan Karshi in Plateau, Nassarawa and Kaduna States. The membership of Ninzic has changed quite significantly between various publications noted in Table 12.

General overviews can be found in Gerhardt (1972/3a, 1983a) and materials on specific languages in Hoffmann (1976), Hörner (1980), Price (1989), Wilson (2003).
The number marking systems of Ninzic must originally have been paired affixes with alliterative concord, as fragments of such systems are found across the group. However, in most languages the system has broken down or become severely eroded and compensatory strategies have evolved. This section uses examples from Ninzo based on Hörner (1980), Ninzo Language Project Committee (1999) and fieldwork in Fadan Wate in 1995.11 Ninzo prefix pairings are in (35):

Many words have unproductive prefixes and singular and plural is now marked only by tone. Some u-/a- prefix alternations are co-associated with u-/i- alternations in the first vowel of the stem in (36):

These suggest an unusual process, the retention of a former ni-/bi- alternation with the addition of an innovative prefix system preceding it. The bV- plural marker is reminiscent of Niger-Congo ba- but this may be coincidence; the core lexemes for persons in Ninzo do not have this alternation. A partial development from this is the formation of plural with VnV- prefixes (38). For example, à- and ì- singular prefixes alternate with ànV- plural prefixes:

As (38) shows there is quite a strong correlation between animals and the anV- plural prefix, which is highly reminiscent of the Bantu Class 9 nì- singular prefix for animals. Ninzo shows no obvious active or fossil morphology for non-count nouns although the word for ‘water’, amasíɽ, has inherited the ma- affix from related Plateau languages.
A common number marking process, which can be combined with prefix alternations, is reduplication of the first syllable of the root seen in (39). The vowel of the reduplicated syllable is usually /i/, but /u/ in two unexplained cases.

Ninzic languages have highly diverse nominal morphology and space precludes describing all of them. Many have a non-count noun prefix, but this seems to vary from one group to another. For example, (40) shows the prefix for liquids in Ce, bə̀-, which is quite consistent, but which seems to be segmentally unrelated to Niger-Congo Class 6, usually mV-.

This is an example of metatypy, the copying of a structural feature without the associated segments.
The Mada language has undergone a striking collapse of characteristic affix alternations, which have then been rebuilt using grammaticalisation strategies, which have resulted in highly idiosyncratic marking of nominal plurals. These can be divided into six categories:
I
tone-change
II
initial syllable reduplication
III
prefix addition
IV
person nouns grammaticalised as pseudo-prefixes
V
diminutives grammaticalised as pseudo-prefixes
VI
suppletives

Prefixes marking size can alternate with non-prefixed nouns creating a plethora of additional forms. Some nouns usually take diminutive prefixes in speech, but these are not easy to predict. The historical layering of these number marking strategies can be detected through the existence of multiple forms, sometimes with, for example, tone-raising applied to a noun formerly which also has first syllable reduplication or prefix addition. The consequence of this has been that the tone-plurals of Mada show extremely low levels of predictability as in Table 13.

========================================
To give a sense of the variety of number marking strategies in Mada, Table 13 above shows the operation of first syllable reduplication in Mada nouns, and selected examples in (41) and (42) below display recently adopted plural strategies.
The most recent addition to the Mada repertoire of plural strategies is probably the mə- prefix. This appears to have two realisations, mə̀- and mə̄-. The low-tone form seems to have no strongly-defined semantic field (41), but mid-tone mə̄- is applied quite strictly to persons (42). The examples in these tables and in other sections show the prefix has been added, sometimes subsequently to other strategies, such as tone-raising or reduplication, providing evidence for its recent genesis. Most nouns taking a mə̀- prefix conserve stem-tone in (41):

Mada provides a striking example of how rapidly a nominal affix system can break down and then be rebuilt using processes of grammaticalisation thereby illustrating the difficulties of tracing synchronic affixes back to a presumed proto-system.
2.6 Alumic
One subgroup of Plateau languages spoken in Central Nigeria has effectively no published data. These languages are Hasha [=Yashi], Sambe, Alumu-Təsu and Toro [=Turkwam]. Except for Sambe, they have apparently been classified in previous lists on the basis of geographical proximity. Sambe is moribund, as there were only two speakers over 90 in 2005, and none remain in 2017. The rest have at most a few hundred speakers. All data and analyses given here were the result of fieldwork by the author.12 
The group is here named Alumic, after the language with the most speakers, but this term can be regarded as provisional. The Alumic languages are now scattered geographically, and isolated among the Ninzic (=Plateau IV) languages. The very different sociolinguistic histories may explain their striking morphological diversity. The internal structure of the Alumic group is shown in Figure 5:

 Figure 5: The relation of Sambe to Hasha and the Alumic languages
Alumu, Toro and Sambe no longer have functioning noun class systems, but the nouns have transparent fossil prefixes. Hasha has developed a highly idiosyncratic system of reduplicating the first syllable of the stem to mark plurality in both nouns and verbs, apparently under the influence of a neighbouring Chadic language, Sha. Təsu has entirely converted to a system of a single plural suffix, with no functioning noun-prefixes. Nonetheless, these can be recovered in part from the existing nouns, especially by comparison with cognate forms in other Plateau languages. Although many nouns have zero prefixes, fossil V- and N- prefixes are quite widespread. The most common prefix is à- and ə̀- is probably its allomorph. (43) shows some characteristic examples:

There is no trace of a semantic association for other prefixes. Liquids and non-count nouns show no characteristic morphological pattern.
Sambe no longer has a functioning noun-class system, perhaps a consequence of the switch to Ninzo. However, it clearly existed until recently and many words were cited with fossil prefixes. Indeed, sometimes a word would be cited in one elicitation with the prefix and again without it, showing the language in transition prior to its inevitable death. The tones marked are best characterised as approximate, with speakers varying between elicitation sessions. Three prefixes can be discerned in the data, kV-, bV- and tV-, each with an underspecified or ‘hollow’ vowel. In some languages this shows concord with the stem vowel, but this does not seem to have been the case with Sambe. The most common prefix is kV̀- in Table 14:

			==========================
From this we can conclude that Sambe originally had an a-/ba- noun class pair for humans. No other fossil prefixes have any semantic associations, and neither mass nouns nor liquids show any common features. The strong presence of CV- prefixes with underspecified vowels is extremely rare in this area, although common in Kainji languages (Blench, this volume).
2.7 East
The three languages constituting Greenberg’s Plateau 6, Fyem, Bo-Rukul [=Mabo-Barkul] and Horom were placed together in the BCCW as SE Plateau. Although named Southeastern (e.g. in Crozier & Blench 1992) it is here named ‘East’ as a better reflection of its direction in relation to the Plateau centre of gravity. However, it is highly uncertain that they do indeed form a coherent group as Bo-Rukul is very distinct from Fyem and Horom. In Figure 1 they have been separated as branches of Plateau with a tentative linkage marked. Nettle (1998a) is a sketch grammar of Fyem, and Nettle (1998b) short wordlists of all three languages, but Bo-Rukul and Horom remain virtually unknown (although see Blench 2003 for their relation with the Ron (Chadic) languages). Since Horom has the most elaborate system of nominal affixing, it is discussed in detail in this section. Data and analysis are based on fieldwork by the author.
Number marking in Horom nouns is characterised by a great diversity of strategies. V-/CV- prefix alternation is the most characteristic process and the possibilities are numerous. Of these, the i- plural prefix is applied in the majority of cases. The singular and plural class/pairings identified so far are shown in Table 17:

	=========================================
Horom also demonstrates some striking semantic unities with respect to plural markers. Singulars are diverse, but almost all animals, from mammals to insects, have i- plural prefixes. Similarly, nouns referring to persons have a ba- prefix (and sometimes a suffix) but with no corresponding singular prefix. Mass nouns and liquids have no defining morphological character. Horom shows no evidence for nasal prefixes; in one apparent case the widespread Plateau root for ‘person’ has grammaticalised as an affix.
The most striking typological feature of Horom is the evolution of a nominal suffixing system, characterised either by vowels or –NV structures. The singular nouns are diverse, with either zero or a wide array of prefixes. The plurals are all prefixed with ba-, and a vocalic or –NV segment. Table 18 shows the nouns so far recorded with both prefixes and suffixes.

These may be infixes or simply a phonological extension of the syllable. None of these words are transparent compounds, but this may be their historical origin, in which case each element of the compound would have retained its plural prefix, with the second prefix undergoing centralisation in some environments.
2.8 South 
2.8.1 General
South Plateau is named for two language groups, Jilic and Eggonic, which are here put together. ‘Southern’ was applied to Jilic alone in Crozier & Blench (1992). Figure 6 shows this new proposal:

Figure 6: Classification of the Jilic-Eggonic languages
The Jilic or Koro languages are spoken in scattered communities across a wide swathe of Central Nigeria and this is usually attributed to persistent slave-raiding in the nineteenth centuries. As speakers have lost contact with one another, their languages have rapidly diversified.
2.8.2 Jilic
Jilic consists of at least two languages, Mijili [=Koro of Lafia] and Ujijili [=Koro Huntu], now separated by a considerable geographic distance, but clearly related.13 There is a microfiched grammar of Mijili by Stofberg (1978), while Ujijili is known from an unpublished wordlist. Koro Ija and Koro Zuba, two languages spoken northwest of Abuja, are said to be nearly intelligible with Ujijili, although no language data exists to demonstrate this. This section will focus on Mijili as described by Stoffberg (1978), but with additional material from fieldwork in 2003. Mijili has a system of number marking on nouns based on prefix alternations. Table 19 is a matrix showing the possible pairings of singular and plural prefixes.

Adapted from Stoffberg (1978:316)

Once allomorphy of the prefixes is taken into account, the number of underlying prefixes is considerably reduced. As elsewhere in Plateau, singular nouns referring to human beings have variable morphology. Many nouns for persons have a former ɲV- prefix, now apparently lexicalised, but still in alternation in one root, the word for ‘young man’ in (49).  Plural prefixes in Mijili nouns for persons are either mV- or a-.

2.8.3 Eggonic
Eggonic consists of just two languages, Eggon and Ake, spoken around Akwanga. These have previously been put together with Ninzic, although this is more a supposition based on geography than historical linguistics. The Eggon people are numerous and their language is divided into numerous dialects, while Ake (=Aike) is spoken in only three villages. Although the languages share enough common glosses to be put together, they are still quite distant from one another. Eggon has a limited system of nominal morphology, while Ake has lost its system entirely. All data and analyses in this section are based on fieldwork by the author.
Ake nouns no longer have morphologically marked plurals, with a few exceptions in the case of persons. However, there is considerable evidence for prior systems of CV prefixes, many of which survive in frozen form preceding the stem. The key to detecting such affixes is external cognates. Many words appear with different prefixes in related languages. Thus, although proto-Ake almost certainly had a ki- prefix, in the word kipindye ‘village/settlement’ the ki- is not a prefix, since it is cognate with forms in remote Plateau languages such as Hyam khep, Jili kúpɔ̃̀, and the –ndye element would then be a compounded element. Such evidence is not available for all the terms with potential affixes, so only more elaborated morphological comparisons will increase certainty. The former V- prefixes often have two distinct tones and may therefore be ultimately of different origins or it may be that this is the result of a now-lost morphophonemic process. However, since they exist in high-low pairs for almost all the hypothetical prefixes reconstructed in Table 20:

Ake has a variety of kV- prefixes which constitute possible evidence for an original affix with an underspecified vowel, such as occur both in Sambe (§2.6) and East Kainji languages such as Boze (see Blench, this volume). Examples are given in (52).

Nouns referring to persons do not have any morphologically unifying characteristics.
2.9 Tarokoid
The Tarokoid languages consist of four distinct languages and the Kwang cluster. Tarok is numerically the most dominant, spoken in a large area around Langtang, while the others are spoken in small communities isolated from one another between Langtang and Jos. Yangkam is moribund, spoken only by men over fifty years of age. Figure 7 shows the internal structure of Tarokoid:

Figure 7: Internal structure of Tarokoid

Within Tarokoid there is a considerable range of nominal morphology. Tarok itself has both the most complete prefix system and alliterative concord. Yangkam has lost functioning affix alternation but has partially developed a system of reduplicating the initial syllable of the stem. Sur has also lost any functioning affixes without the evolution of a compensatory process, perhaps under the influence of the Chadic language Ngas. 
Kwang marks number with singular/plural prefix pairings, but these are extremely reduced compared with Tarok or Pe14. With very few exceptions, all plurals are marked with an à- prefix.  Kwang has a small number of nouns where plurality is marked with a tone-change, Low/High or Mid/High, and some irregular plurals which may be examples of residual consonant mutation. Changes in the stem vowel occur in the plurals of some lexemes connected with persons. Table 21 shows the nominal prefixes of Kwang. By far the most common singular prefix is ø- and plural à-.
Table 21: Kwang nominal prefixes

Plural

	à-
ì- 
	kí-

ǹ-


However, the large number of palatalised and labialised stems in Kwang suggests that i- and u- prefixes were formerly present. By far the most common singular/ plural alternation is ø-/à-, as shown in (57):

Kwang seems to have deleted the prefixes on singular nouns very extensively, as most of these now show only the root with no fossil morpheme. Nouns referring to persons all take à- plurals, but the singulars have no distinctive features. Some nouns copy the number marker at the end of the word, and assimilate the stem vowel if it is not the same –a as in (58):

Despite the example of ‘blood’ there is no association between mass nouns or liquids and nasal prefixes.
The noun classes of Tarok have been described in Sibomana (1981) with additional material in Longtau (2008). Sibomana (1981) sets up 6 singular and plural noun classes for Tarok (Table 22):
Table 22: Tarok noun-class pairings

The order of the numbers seems less than ideal, but since it is reprised in Longtau (2008) it is also used here. Historically, these pairings must result from the merger of a more complex system, as in many singular/plural pairs there are changes in the stem tone. Some of these seem to show semantic correlations, others do not, again suggesting class merger. Tarok also has a rich inventory of adjectives with concordial prefixes. Nasal prefixes are homorganic with the following consonant, with m- preceding bilabials and n- all others. 
Persons in Tarok are almost exclusively in Class 1/2, i.e. with a u-/o- prefix alternation, as shown in (61):

No other semantic set, such as large animals, trees or body parts, shows a tendency to cluster around a particular prefix pairing.
2.10 Eloyi
The Eloyi or Afo language is spoken in about twenty villages in Nassarawa State, Nigeria. The principle sources on the language are Mackay (1964) and Armstrong (1964, 1983, 198415). The classification of Eloyi has been disputed, all the more so because the lexical database for comparison has been so weak. All the preliminary sources classified Eloyi as Plateau 2, i.e. together Izere, Tyap etc. (e.g. Greenberg 1963; Williamson & Shimizu 1968; De Wolf 1971). Armstrong (1983) set out the case for classifying Eloyi as Idomoid, which is a West Benue-Congo or Volta-Niger subgroup, classified together with Yoruba, Igbo, Nupe and Ẹdo. However, in Armstrong’s (1984:29) final published discussion of the subject he expresses some doubts, concluding ‘Eloyi does not now seem as close to Idoma as it did when only Varvil’s list was available’. Eloyi has a rich system of alternating nominal prefixes, in contrast to the remainder of Idomoid, and is provisionally treated here as Plateau, though with significant influence from Idomoid. The analysis here is based on the cited published sources, and an unpublished wordlist collected by Barau Kato at the request of the author.16
Despite the complex affix-pairings, many words have zero prefixes, perhaps due to the impact of extensive bilingualism with Idomoid languages. Many alternations have only one or two cases so far recorded, which makes setting up the system highly provisional. Table 23 shows the nominal prefix pairings in Eloyi.
kV- prefixes are probably the most common in Eloyi singulars and lV- for plurals. Although usually some type of stem harmony would be expected to operate there is no evidence for this in Eloyi.

Eloyi noun-class pairings do not show much semantic clustering. Most nouns referring to persons have diverse singulars, and plurals in a- or e-. Mother and father have an exceptional class prefix pair which may reflect the Niger-Congo persons class seen in (63).

3. Conclusion: Plateau nominal affixing
The numerous examples illustrate the problems of making any generalisations about nominal affixes in Plateau and only weak conclusions can be drawn about its relationship with other branches of Benue-Congo. This represents a common problem of historical linguistics in such a significant contact zone. Traces of prefixes familiar from Bantu and Niger-Congo are found scattered across the family, and in the light of external data it might seem likely that these were present in proto-Plateau. However, on the basis of synchronic data in Plateau alone it would be rash to reconstruct them. Taking the data as a whole we can conclude that: 
a) Plateau languages originally had a rich noun class system with CV- and V- prefixes and alliterative concord
b) A wave of renewal and analogical re-alignment led to many of the CV- prefixes disappearing or becoming unproductive and replaced by a much smaller set of V- prefixes.
c) There is some evidence for underspecified vowels in CV- prefixes showing concord with stem vowels although this is too rare to be conclusive.
d) There is evidence for a class pair for persons, probably V-/bV-, although the segment in the singular prefix are less certain (e.g. (33) and (37). This can be compared with the Niger-Congo person class.
e) Proto-Plateau almost certainly had an unpaired nasal class marking liquids, mass nouns and abstracts, corresponding to Niger-Congo (e.g. 14, 34). Unlike Kainji, this is rarely realised as ma- and several branches of Plateau have nV-. Ndun in (34)  does display ma-, me-, and m-. Other unpaired classes exhibit quite different segments which may be innovative. 
f) There is strong evidence that proto-Plateau had N- prefixes, homorganic with the following consonant, and present in most branches. However, there is no evidence for any consistent semantic association.
g) There is weak evidence that the Bantu Class 9 prefix, nì-, existed in early Plateau (cf. (38)).
Based on the synchronic evidence from Plateau, the connection with Niger-Congo noun classes remains tenuous. Only the non-count nouns and the person class show similarities and even these are obscured by innovative affixes. Similarly, there is no single affix alternation that provides evidence for the genetic unity of Plateau. This can only be deduced from lexical isoglosses (e.g. in Blench 2000a). The paper presents a summary of what is known about number marking strategies on nouns in the Plateau languages. Further work will enrich the picture, but it is unlikely to contribute to a coherent reconstruction, as affix renewal has been very extensive.
