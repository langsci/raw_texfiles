\addchap{Acknowledgements}

This book bears the name of a single author, but it could not have come to light without a team effort. Indeed, the analysis is entirely based on data elicited within the VILLA project, to which I had the privilege of being welcomed from an early stage. Therefore I would like to warmly thank all to the people who devoted their effort, knowledge and experience to develop and run this ambitious research: Giuliano Bernini, Christine Dimroth, Rebekah Rast, Marianne Starren, Marzena Watorek (the VILLA steering committee), along with Cecilia Andorno, Marina Chini, Roberta Grassi, Henriëtte Hendriks, Heather Hilton, Johanna Hinz, Monika Krzempek, Agnieszka Latos, Emma Marsden, Urszula Paprocka, Sebastian Piotrowski, Leah Roberts, Ellie Shoemaker, Ada Valentini, in addition to numerous technicians and student assistants. Special thanks go to the many VILLA learners, too, who lent us their time as well as their learner varieties, trusting that the experiment would benefit our understanding of the language faculty.
I am particularly indebted to the two advisors who jointly supervised my PhD project, on which this book is based. My mentor Giuliano Bernini taught me a particular way to look at linguistic facts, both within and beyond the field of language acquisition, and transmitted to me the values of scientific rigour and professional ethics. Indeed, my work has always been inspired by the wish to be up to these teachings. Marzena Watorek fascinated me with her almost personal relation with the data, along with a certain taste for complexity and the tireless search for new paths to explore. When writing the book, this approach would indeed prove precious to look at the same phenomenon from multiple perspectives in search of a coherent, overall picture.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the “EuroSLA studies” series editor Gabriele Pallotti for his very accurate and untiring editing of the book. The final product owes much to his scientific rigour and linguistic culture, not to mention his personal generosity and the great amount of time and effort he devoted to it. Finally, many thanks to all the people who contributed to this work at various times, including the anonymous reviewers and consultants and the whole editorial staff.\medskip
