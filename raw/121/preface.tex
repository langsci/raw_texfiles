The 28 papers in this volume were presented at the 46th Annual Conference on African Linguistics, held at the University of Oregon, March 26-28, 2015. The conference featured nearly 120 papers, addressing phonetics, phonology, morphosyntax, semantics, information structure, sociolinguistics, and historical linguistics, as well as a workshop on \ili{Luhya} languages of East Africa. The selected papers in this volume represent the broad range of topics and language families that characterized the conference, as well as the maturation of research in African linguistics.
