\addchap{\lsPrefaceTitle}

This book originated in courses given at UCLA at various times, and at
Stanford. It became a reality, however, when I was able to live in
Geneva, Switzerland, for most of 1981-83. It is impossible for a
linguist in Geneva not to spend at least a little time meditating on
\name{Ferdinand}{de Saussure}, and everything else follows from that. 

The present work owes much to discussions with many people over a
number of years. Aside from students in courses where this material
has been presented, I am obliged-to the following for comments or
suggestions relating to portions of the manuscript: \name{Bill}{Darden}, \name{Eli}{Fischer-JÃ¸rgensen}, \name{John}{Goldsmith}, \name{Morris}{Halle}, \name{Paul}{Kiparsky}, \name{Peter}{Ladefoged}, \name{Roger}{Lass}, \name{Will}{Leben}, \name{Bill}{Poser}, \name{Eddy}{Roulet}, \name{Alan}{Timberlake}, and \name{Nigel}{Vincent}. \name{Fritz}{Newmeyer} deserves special thanks
for providing careful and eminently helpful comments on nearly the
entire book. Finally, I would like to thank \name{Outi}{Bat-El} for her work
in preparing the {[original]} index. Naturally, none of these people should be
blamed for my errors, omissions, and failures to follow their advice.

My time in Geneva, and much of the research and writing of this book,
were supported during 1982-83 by a postdoctoral fellowship from the
American Council of Learned Societies. The assistance of the ACLS both
at this time and in the past has been invaluable to me, and I am very
grateful to that body. Preliminary work during the spring quarter of
1982 was supported by a sabbatical leave from the University of
California, for which I am also grateful. Research and library
facilities were provided me during my stay in Switzerland by the
linguistics department at the University of Zurich, whom I would like
to thank here.

Finally, the support (personal, financial, and otherwise) of my wife
Janine M. Anderson-Bays was also essential, both to our stay in
Switzerland and to the writing of this book. I hope she will find in
it some reasons to believe that the time was not only pleasant but
worthwhile.
