\title{Long distance agreement in Spanish dialects}

\abstract{This paper discusses data from various dialects of Spanish manifesting agreement between an inflected verb and a \CATPP-internal \CATNP in the context of non-paradigmatic SE (e.g., Se vieron a los niños – Eng. ‘Children were seen’). An analysis is put forward in terms of Long Distance Agreement (cf. \citealt{Chomsky2000}; \citeyear{Chomsky2001Derivation}) between T (the locus of nominative Case) and an \CATNP Goal within a \CATKP/\CATPP. It is shown that this derivational possibility is subject to different microparametric layers teasing apart varieties allowing agreement across dative-like Case assigners (in differential object marking) and other prepositions that do not obviously participate in standard Case-agreement dependencies—thus giving rise to a pattern that qualifies as a \is{passive!pseudopassive}pseudopassive of sorts.}

\section{Introduction}% 1. 

It is an old observation that languages of the \ili{Spanish} type fail to deploy both \isi{preposition} stranding and \is{passive!pseudopassive}pseudopassives, as the examples in (1) and (2) below show (cf. \citealt{Law2006} and references therein for discussion). 

\ea[*]{%1
    \label{ex:gallego:1}
    \langinfo{Spanish}{}{\citealt[741]{Campos1991}}\\
    \gll Quién contaron todos con?\\
           who    counted.\textsc{3pl}  all      with\\
    \glt  ‘Who did everybody count on?’}
    \z

\ea[*]{%2
    \label{ex:gallego:2}

         José be counted.\textsc{3sg} with by   everybody\\
    \glt ‘José is counted on by everybody.’}
    \z

Plausibly, the factor responsible for (1) is also behind (2), at least if the key element for both processes to take place is the category P, a locus of parametric variation (cf. \citealt{Hornstein1981,Kayne1984,Kayne1994,Kayne2005,Abels2003}; and references therein). In more abstract terms, we seem to be dealing with two constraints affecting \is{preposition}prepositions and blocking both A and A-bar dependencies, which is what (3) is meant to capture:

\ea%3
    \label{ex:gallego:3}

     \ex \ldots\xspace XP cannot be a \isi{Goal} (no \is{passive!pseudopassive}pseudopassives)
     \end{xlisti}
\z

This paper discusses data from certain dialects of \ili{Spanish} that depart from (3) in the context of passive SE sentences, at least for agreement cases. In particular, it will be shown that \is{agreement!long-distance agreement}Long Distance Agreement (LDA) is possible between T (the locus of Nominative Case; cf. \citealt{Chomsky2000,Chomsky2001Derivation}) and a \CATDP \isi{Goal} within a \CATPP. I will compare the data with previously reported evidence involving the \isi{Differential Object Marking} \isi{preposition} \textit{a} (cf. \citealt{Torrego1998,López2012}) in order to argue that there are three types of \is{preposition}prepositions when it comes to the possibility for external Probes ($\varphi $-complete T) to bypass them.

The paper is organized as follows. §2 reviews the agreement options of passive SE sentences. §3 discusses the main properties of two patterns where T can agree with a \CATDP introduced by a \isi{preposition}; the first pattern covers what \citet{RAE-ASALE2009} dubs the ‘hybrid pattern’ (agreement across the differential marker \textit{a}), whereas the second pattern involves agreement in the context of more full-fledged \is{preposition}prepositions; §4 puts forward a Probe-\isi{Goal} analysis of the facts (cf. \citealt{Chomsky2000,Chomsky2001Derivation}) that makes use of the idea that P can undergo incorporation (cf. \citealt{Hornstein1981,Law2006}). §5 contains the main conclusions.

\section{Agreement properties of SE sentences in Spanish}% 2. 

Passive\slash \isi{impersonal} SE sentences have been the focus of much research (cf. \citealt{Mendikoetxea1992,Mendikoetxea1999,Raposo1996,D’Alessandro2007,López2007}; among others). If we concentrate on \ili{Spanish}, it has been noted that the clitic SE can be part of structures where T agrees with the internal argument (IA, henceforth) (so-called Passive SE; see (4)), but it can also be part of structures where agreement fails (so-called Impersonal SE; see (5)), where T shows \is{agreement!default agreement}default agreement and the IA may or may not be headed by a Case marker, which depends on independent factors:

\ea%4
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:4}\\
    \gll Se  criticaron        los recortes.        \\
         \textsc{se} criticize.\textsc{3pl}  the cuts\\
    \glt ‘Budget cuts were criticized.’
    \z

\ea%5
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:5}\\
    \ea
    \gll Se   criticó             los  recortes.      \\
          \textsc{se}  criticize.\textsc{3sg}  the  cuts\\
    \glt ‘Budget cuts were criticized.’
    \ex
    \gll Se  criticó             a        los  políticos.           \\
         \textsc{se}  criticize.\textsc{3sg}  \textsc{dom} the politicians\\
    \glt ‘Politicians were criticized.’
    \z
\z

Consider the patterns above. The sentence in (4) contains a $\varphi $-defective \textit{v} that cannot Case-license the IA \textit{los recortes} (Eng. ‘the budget cuts’). As argued by both \citet{Raposo1996}, SE may be taken to occupy the external argument position (cf. \citealt{López2007}), thus behaving like an \isi{expletive} of sorts (an idea that has been applied to spurious SE in clitic combinations; cf. \citealt[160]{Kayne2000}; \citealt{Gallego2017}). The sentences in (5) are not \textit{bona fide} passives: in such cases, \textit{v} is presumably $\varphi $-complete, and the IA receives \is{case!accusative case}accusative Case, which can be differentially marked (as in (5b)) or not (as in (5a)); as expected, T shows defective (3\textsuperscript{rd} person singular) agreement.

The two agreeing patterns of sentences involving SE have also been reported in traditional atlases such as the ALPI (Atlas Lingüístico de la Península Ibérica). The following data, taken from \citet{Benito2010}, show this:\footnote{Just to address a question by an anonymous reviewer, although the ALPI also collects information from Portugal, here I am focusing on \ili{Spanish} data alone.}\largerpage[1.5]

    \z
\z

As a closer look at the data in (4) and (5) reveals, \isi{passive} and \isi{impersonal} SE sentences have a common base – they have the same argument structure, the only difference being agreement. In this context, \citet[§26.3.2.2]{Mendikoetxea1999} observes that passive SE sentences can manifest full or partial (defective) agreement, as illustrated in (7a) and (7b) respectively (cf. \citealt{Martín1979} for discussion):

\ea%7
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:7}\\
    \ea
    \gll En  este  país        se   dicen       muchas  gilipolleces.       \\
         in   this   country  \textsc{se}  say\textsc{{}.3pl}  many     bullshit\\
    \glt ‘People say bullshit in this country.’
    \ex
    \gll En  este  país        se   dice        muchas  gilipolleces.       \\
         in   this   country  \textsc{se} say\textsc{{}.3sg}  many     bullshit \\
    \glt ‘People say bullshit in this country.’
    \z
\z\largerpage[-2]

Although (7a) is clearly better to my ear, the patterns in (7) are both possible, and there is no consistent dialectal tendency, as far as I can tell. The $\varphi $-defective configuration has been reported in Old \ili{Spanish} texts, and it is also present in varieties of present-day European and American \ili{Spanish} (cf. \citealt{Mendikoetxea1999}).\footnote{\citet{RAE-ASALE2009} discusses a series of factors that may be behind the lack of agreement in such cases (the category of the internal argument, its preverbal\slash postverbal position, the presence of dative arguments, etc.). I put these issues aside here.} The $\varphi $-complete configuration involves unproblematic local agreement between T and the IA – a situation also displayed in \DAT-\NOM structures, whose intricacies I put aside here (cf. \citealt{López2007,Chomsky2008}).\footnote{An anonymous reviewer points out that we should not forget about discourse features and their valuation, as these are key in \DAT-\NOM constructions. It is unclear what the reviewer means here. If he\slash she is referring to notions like topic or focus, I simply do not assume they are features in the Probe-\isi{Goal} sense (for discussion, see \citealt{Chomsky2001Derivation,Chomsky2008,Chomsky2017,Ott2016}). The fact that IOs participate in an agreement relation before DOs (or internal arguments more generally)  can be accounted for without resorting to any discourse feature.} 

There are more interesting cross-clausal cases, where agreement takes place at a distance. Thus, matrix T can long-distance agree with the IA of an embedded \isi{infinitive}. This is well-known in the case of auxiliaries, but the pattern covers semi-auxiliaries and other verbs: 

\ea%8
\settowidth\jamwidth{[\textsc{semiaux} = try, need, etc.]}
    \label{ex:gallego:8}
    \ea\relax [ T [ SE  V\textsubscript{AUX}         [ INF XP ] ] ]      \jambox{[\textsc{aux} = can, should, etc.]}
    \ex\relax [ T [ SE  V\textsubscript{SEMIAUX}  [ INF XP ] ] ]         \jambox{[\textsc{semiaux} = try, need, etc.]}
    \z
\z\largerpage[-2]

Consider the following \citep[Chapter~28]{RAE-ASALE2009}, where I indicate Probe and \isi{Goal} (the agreeing elements) with bold letters.

\ea%9
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:9}\\

    \glt ‘Certain laws are tried to be eliminated.’  
    \ex
    \gll Se  \textbf{necesitan}  [ conocer     \textbf{sus}    \textbf{propiedades} ].         \\
            \textsc{se}  need\textsc{{}.3pl} {}  know.\textsc{inf}   their  properties\\
    \glt    ‘Their properties are needed to be known.’
    \ex
    \gll No se   \textbf{supieron}  [ usar        \textbf{esos}    \textbf{recursos} ].        \\
            not \textsc{se} knew\textsc{{}.3pl} {}   use.\textsc{inf}   those   resources\\
    \glt    ‘Those resources were not known to be used.’
    \ex
    \gll  Se   \textbf{han}           querido [ manchar        \textbf{reputaciones} ].     \\
            \textsc{se} have\textsc{{}.3pl} wanted {}   damage.\textsc{inf}   reputations\\
    \glt     ‘Reputations were wanted to be damaged.’
    \z
\z

Evidence like that provided by \citet{RAE-ASALE2009} has also been collected by dialectologists working on atlases:

\ea%10 
\gll En el huerto se \textbf{podían} plantar \textbf{rosales}.\\
in the garden \textsc{se} could.\textsc{3pl} plant rose.bushes\\
\glt ‘Rose bushes can be planted in the garden.’\\
(from \citealt[13]{Benito2010}) \\

\z

Interestingly, LDA situations go beyond SE scenarios, as shown in (11). As before, the $\varphi $-Probe on T scans into the embedded clause, displaying a phenomenon we can dub “hyperagreement”.\footnote{\citet{Fernández-Serrano2016} provides a detailed analysis of the data above based on the idea that agreement takes place whenever the embedded clause projects fewer layers of structure (undergoing a restructuring of sorts, but from a phase-theoretic perspective; cf. \citealt{Gallego2009}), which has morphological and interpretive consequences.}\largerpage[-3]

\ea%11
    \label{ex:gallego:11}
    \ea
    \gll Siempre   nos    \textbf{tocaron}              [ resolver  \textbf{problemas} ].\\
         always    to.us  be.our.turn.\textsc{3pl} {} solve       problems\\
    \glt ‘We always had to solve problems.’
    \ex
    \gll Nos   \textbf{faltan}    [ hacer  \textbf{dos}  \textbf{goles} ].\\
         to.us  lack.\textsc{3pl} {} make two goals\\
    \glt ‘We still have to score two goals.’
    \z
\z    

Notice that, in both SE and SE-less cases, agreement is only in number, not person (cf. \citealt{Etxepare2006}), but there seems to be robust evidence that we are dealing with syntactic LDA.\footnote{%
    A reviewer suggests that agreement is also for third person here, but this is not accurate, as this is a default value. If agreement was complete (number and person), then one would expect to find, for instance, SE sentences with 1st or 2nd \is{agreement!person agreement}person agreement; however, as \citet{López2007} points out, this is impossible in \ili{Spanish}:
    
    \ea \ili{Spanish} \citep[127]{López2007}\\
    \ea[*]{\gll Se  vimos      unos  lingüistas en  el   mercado ayer.\\
                \textsc{se}     saw.\textsc{1pl}  some linguists   in  the market    yesterday\\

    \ex[*]{\gll Se  visteis      unos  lingüistas en  el    mercado  ayer.\\

            \glt ‘Some linguists were seen in the market yesterday.’\\(intended meaning: Some of you linguists were seen in the market)}
    \z
    \z} 
To conclude, consider previously unnoticed situations in which intervention-like effects arise in the context of an auxiliary: 

\ea%12
\judgewidth{?*}
    \label{ex:gallego:12}
    \ea[?]{
    \gll Me       \textbf{faltaron}      [ corregir \textbf{esos}   \textbf{exámenes} ].\\
         to.me   lacked.\textsc{3pl} {}  mark      those exams\\
    \glt ‘I couldn’t mark those exams.’}
    \ex[?*]{
    \gll Me      \textbf{faltaron}   [ haber  corregido \textbf{esos}    \textbf{exámenes} ].\\
         to.me  lacked\textsc{{}.3pl} {} have   marked     those  exams\\
    \glt ‘I couldn’t have marked those exams.’}
    \z
\z

A second piece of evidence comes from \is{clitic!clitic-climbing}clitic climbing (cf. \citealt{Gallego2016,Paradís2016}; and references therein). As (13) shows, LDA is worse if a clitic stays in situ:

\ea%13
    \label{ex:gallego:13}
    \ea
    \gll Se  \textbf{pueden}  [ leer   \textbf{esos}    \textbf{libros} ].\\
         \textsc{se} can\textsc{{}.3pl} {}  read  those  books\\
    \glt ‘Those books can be read.’
    \ex
    \gll Se   (me)      \textbf{pueden}  [ leer(?*me)    \textbf{esos}    \textbf{libros} ].\\
         \textsc{se} to.me  can\textsc{{}.3pl} {}   {read   to.me}  those  books\\
    \glt ‘Those books can be read to me.’
    \z
\z

Let us conclude. This section has reviewed the main properties of SE sentences in \ili{Spanish}, paying attention to the various agreement patterns they display in the different varieties of \ili{Spanish}. Two main patterns have been identified, following the literature. One features a $\varphi $-defective \textit{v}, which explains the lack of accusative Case (and thus agreement with T). The other features a $\varphi $-complete \textit{v}, which blocks \isi{Agree} (T, IA). As we have seen, the alternation between agreeing and non-agreeing options is not subject to any systematic dialectal logic (there is no “isogloss” telling us where agreement stops), so we seem to have a case of \isi{optionality} – with a tendency towards full agreement, a murky issue that seems to have semantic consequences in biclausal scenarios (cf. \citealt{Martin1998,Fernández-Serrano2016}). 

As we have seen, such \isi{optionality} is frequent whenever the IA is not differentially marked. However, agreement has also been reported in cases where the DO is preceded by a Case marker, a pattern I would like to refer to as hybrid, which I discuss in the following section.

\section{Agreement across P in Spanish} % 3. 
\subsection{Introduction}%  3.1. 

This section considers two configurations in which agreement between T and the complement of a \isi{preposition} can take place in \ili{Spanish}. The first one involves the differential marker \textit{a} (cf. \citealt{Torrego1998,López2012}) and the second one involves full-fledged \is{preposition}prepositions. Roughly, the relevant abstract patterns are as in (14), where K and P give rise to Case and P projections.\footnote{The distinction between K and P is equivalent to that between functional or lexical \is{preposition}prepositions (see \citealt{Riemsdijk1990} and references therein for discussion).}

After briefly discussing the case of agreement across \DOM (namely, (14a)), I turn my attention to (14b), suggesting that P undergoes incorporation, giving rise to a P-stranding-less version of \is{passive!pseudopassive}pseudopassives. In terms of parametric tendencies, the second scenario is unexpected, given the properties of \ili{Romance} languages. This should explain its limited availability, which seems to be largely restricted to American varieties.

\subsection{Agreement across \DOM}% 3.2. 

We have already seen that SE sentences can be passive (with agreement) and \isi{impersonal} (without agreement). Above we saw the relevant data in (4) and (5), repeated as (15) and (16):\largerpage[2]

\noindent\parbox{\textwidth}{\ea%15

    \gll Se  criticaron        los recortes.            \\
         \textsc{se} criticize\textsc{{}.3pl}  the cuts\\
    \glt ‘Budget cuts were criticized.’
    \z}

\ea%16
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:16}\\
    \ea
    \gll Se   criticó             los  recortes.            \\

    \ex

         \textsc{se} criticize\textsc{{}.3sg}  \textsc{dom} the politicians\\
    \glt ‘Politicians were criticized.’
    \z
\z

As noted, if \textit{v} is $\varphi $-complete (the (15) example), the IA presumably receives accusative Case, which can be coupled with the differential marker \textit{a}, as in (16b). This is precisely the pattern in which agreement is most unlikely to happen – for the same reason agreement does not bypass \is{preposition}prepositions more generally. That said, agreement does seem to be possible in some cases, even in the context of \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM; this variant of the pattern in (16b), to which I return below, is called “hybrid” by \citet{RAE-ASALE2009}.\footnote{Variation in this domain does not seem to adhere to any clear-cut geographical distinction. For some speakers, agreement is optional, and has no interpretive consequences. \citet{Planells2017} approaches the facts by taking T to agree optionally with SE or the (shifted, for \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM reasons) internal argument – which are responsible for partial and complete agreement respectively. The approach makes use of \citegen{Chomsky1995} \isi{\textit{equidistance}} (cf. \citealt{Gallego2013} for discussion), but the facts could also be handled by the approach to variation put forward in \citet{Obata2016}, where parameters boil down to SMT-compliant derivations whose order of operations varies.}

The \textit{v} of (16) should be $\varphi $-complete \textit{v}, therefore \textit{v}* in the sense of \citet{Chomsky2001Derivation}. However, it is not immediately obvious that \textit{bona fide} Accusative Case is assigned in the two examples offered in (16). Consider the contrast in (17), where the accusative clitic \textit{lo} (Eng. ‘it’) can only be used if the antecedent is animate (\textit{a Trump} – Eng. ‘Trump’):\footnote{As an anonymous reviewer rightly points out, there is non-trivial variation concerning the case of clitics in these constructions, even within European varieties of \ili{Spanish}. Taking into account all the dialectal subtleties that concern clitics is beyond the scope of this paper.}

\ea%17
    \label{ex:gallego:17}
    \ea[*]{
    \gll Los poemas, se   \textbf{los}                recita        en clase de literatura.            \\

    \z
\z   

The asymmetry in (17) looks consistent, so let’s assume the following generalization, taking it for granted that only \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM signals Accusative Case assignment:\footnote{Although (18) is stable across dialects, there are well-known exceptions. In particular, the pattern is more restricted in European \ili{Spanish}. In non-European varieties, on the other hand, \citet[§41.12m]{RAE-ASALE2009} observes that \textit{v}* can assign Accusative Case to inanimate IAs in the Andean, Chilean, and River Plate areas (cf. \citealt{Gallego2016}).}

\ea%18
\label{ex:gallego:18}
If the IA is differentially-marked (\textit{a} XP), then SE \textit{v} is \textit{v}* ($\varphi $-complete).

An interesting piece of evidence indicating that accusative Case may not be at play even in the presence of \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM comes from the observation that leísta varieties of \ili{Spanish} show a preference for the dative clitic \textit{le} (Eng. ‘to him\slash her’) in the presence of SE, as in (19):

\ea%19
    \ea
    Non-leísta/American \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:19}\\
    \gll Se  \textbf{lo}       critica.          \\
              \textsc{se}  \textsc{cl.acc} criticize\textsc{{}.3}\textsc{sg}\\
    \glt      ‘He is criticized.’
    \ex Leísta/European \ili{Spanish}\\
    \gll Se \{?\textbf{lo}    /    \textbf{le}\}       critica.      \\
                 \textsc{se}   \textsc{cl.acc} ~ \textsc{cl.dat}   criticize\textsc{{}.3}\textsc{sg}\\
    \glt      ‘He is criticized.’
    \z
\z   

This raises the more general question whether differentially-marked IAs receive true \is{case!accusative case}accusative. If the answer is negative, this would explain the restricted availability of \textit{lo}/\textit{la} (only with animates), and the preference for \textit{le} in European \ili{Spanish}. The tendency to have a \textit{lo > le} shift in the context of SE is noted by \citet{Ordóñez2004}:

\ea%20
    European \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:20}\\
    \gll Si hay                 que  fusilar-\textbf{lo},  SE \textbf{le} fusila.\\
        if  there.be\textsc{{}.3}\textsc{sg}  that  shoot\textsc{{}-cl}  \textsc{se}  \textsc{cl}  shoot\textsc{{}.3}\textsc{sg}\\
    \glt ‘If he must be shot, he is shot.’ (from P. Preston, \textit{Franco}, cited by \citealt{Ordóñez2004})
    \z

This accusative-dative connection would naturally align with leísmo, which seems to be present in the only \ili{Romance} language with consistent \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM: \ili{Spanish}. \citet{Colomina2017} in fact argue that \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM involves a process of accusative Case displacement, assuming that the structure that underlies (21) is (22):

\ea%21
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:21}\\
    \gll Nadie    visitó             a          Trump.   \\
         nobody  visited\textsc{{}.3}\textsc{sg}  \textsc{dom}   Trump\\
    \glt ‘Nobody visited Trump.’
    \z

\ea%22
    \label{ex:gallego:22}
    [\textit{\textsubscript{v}}\textsubscript{P} nadie \textit{v} [\textsubscript{VP} PROVIDE [ (to) Trump [ P VISIT ] ] ] ]
\z

          

In this context, it is interesting to note that Mexican \ili{Spanish}, which is not leísta, becomes (obligatorily) leísta if SE is introduced. In fact, as (23) reveals, this type of leísmo is more general than the one present in European varieties, for it applies to both masculine and feminine {\CATDP}s (as in \textit{bona fide} datives, as emphasized by \citealt{Colomina2017}).

\ea%23
    Mexican \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:23}\\
    \ea
    \gll A       tu      amigo         SE  \textbf{le} ve         preocupado.  \\
         \textsc{dom}   your friend\textsc{{}.m.}\textsc{sg} \textsc{se}   him\textsc{{}.dat.m.}\textsc{sg}  see\textsc{.3sg} worried\\
    \glt ‘Your friend, he looks worried.’
    \ex
    \gll A       tu      amiga        SE  \textbf{le} ve          preocupada. \\
         \textsc{dom}   your friend\textsc{{}.f.}\textsc{sg} \textsc{se}   her\textsc{{}.dat.f.}\textsc{sg} see\textsc{.3sg} worried\\
    \glt ‘Your friend, she looks worried.’
    \z
\z

\citet{Gallego2016} builds on the previous description of the facts to argue that \isi{impersonal} SE sentences can be divided into two broad dialects:

\ea%24
    \label{ex:gallego:24}
    \ea Dialect A: \textit{v} is $\varphi ${}-defective
    \ex Dialect B: \textit{v} is $\varphi ${}-complete
    \z
\z

The morphological distinction targeting \textit{v} implies the following:

\ea%25
    \label{ex:gallego:25}
    \ea Leísta \ili{Spanish}\\
     Dialect A:   [\textit{\textsubscript{v}}\textsubscript{P} \textit{v} [\textsubscript{VP} V  [\textsubscript{PP} \ConnectTail{\textit{a}}\relax   [ \ConnectHead{DP}\textsubscript{OBLIQUE}] ] ] ] 
    \ex Non-leísta \ili{Spanish}\\

    \ex Hybrid pattern\\

The key distinction between A and B dialects is whether \is{case!accusative case}Accusative Case is assigned or displaced. If the latter is the case, some oblique (dative, if some version of \citegen{Marantz1991} \is{case!dependent case}Dependent Case approach is at work) assigner takes care of the IA.

The most intriguing pattern is (25c), which is reported by \citet{Ordóñez2007}. As these authors note, Mexican and Argentinian varieties of \ili{Spanish} feature what \citet{RAE-ASALE2009} calls the ‘hybrid’ pattern (cf. \citealt{Planells2017} and references therein for discussion).

    \glt  ‘More than 120,000 damaged people were evacuated.’

These data are not expected if the IA is inactive, after receiving accusative Case. In order to account for them, we would need to assume that: (i) the IA is Case-less (otherwise the $\varphi $-Probe on T could not match it) and (ii) the Case marker \textit{a} cannot give rise to a \CATPP or a \CATKP projection. It must in fact be analyzed as an element inserted in the NS → PF wing of the derivation – in other words, as a dissociated morpheme (cf. \citealt{Halle1993}).

  Now that we have reviewed agreement across differential markers, in the next section I pay attention to situations where agreement is rampant, and in fact ignores elements that are not mere functional Case markers, but are seemingly full-fledged \is{preposition}prepositions.

\subsection{Agreement across full-fledged P}% 3.3.

We have just discussed data where the $\varphi $-Probe on T within SE sentences matches a differentially marked IA. Such cases, though subject to a rather unclear dialectal distribution, fall into place if \ili{Spanish} \textit{a} can be considered a functional element, not a \isi{preposition} in its own right. Surprisingly, some American \ili{Spanish} dialects seem to allow a pattern of agreement that can also ignore \is{preposition}prepositions other than \textit{a}. Consider the examples in (27), taken from internet searches:\largerpage[2]

These data have not been described in reference grammars of \ili{Spanish} (cf. \citealt{Bosque1999,RAE-ASALE2009}), plausibly because they can be can be regarded as production errors. The data have, however, also been reported by the Syntactic Atlas of \ili{Spanish} (ASinEs) (see \figref{ex:gallego:30}).\largerpage[-1]

Furthermore, note that the texts from which I have gathered the examples are not oral, and they are not isolated online hits. The fact that this type of evidence can also be found in the CREA database seems to me enough to regard it as part of the speakers’ competence. Therefore, what one could plausibly conclude from these examples is that American dialects of \ili{Spanish} display a restricted variety of \is{passive!pseudopassive}pseudopassives (modulo P-stranding). Let us refer to this process as “P-phasing”, merely to indicate that the P undergoes a change of state that allows the $\varphi ${}-Probe on T to match the \CATDP. 

\section{A Probe-Goal analysis of the facts}% 4. 


Some questions arise if, as I have argued, the \is{preposition}prepositions in the examples can be bypassed by a $\varphi ${}-Probe. To begin with, one may wonder whether the same phenomenon is found not only with SE passives, but also with periphrastic (BE) passives. The answer is negative, as examples like the following are ruled out by American \ili{Spanish} speakers who accept the data in  (27), (28) and (29):



\ea%31
    American \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:31}\\
    \ea[*]{
    \gll \textbf{Fueron}  \textbf{habladas}          con   \textbf{las}  \textbf{autoridades}.  \\

    \glt ‘The authorities were spoken to.’  }

    \glt  ‘Four homicides were reported.’
    }
    \z
\z    

The process of P-phasing might further be related to the prepositional-tran\-si\-tive alternation, illustrated in (31), that many prepositional verbs undergo in \ili{Spanish} (cf. \citealt{Demonte1991,García-Miguel1995,Gallego2010}; and references therein):\footnote{Plausibly too, the speakers that allow for P-phasing also accept P-stranding in \ili{Spanish} (cf. \citealt{Depiante2013,Lemos2013}; and references therein).}

\ea%32

    \ea
    \gll He             pensado (en) la     respuesta.        \\

         have{}.\textsc{1pl}  discussed  about  that  matter  in  the meeting\\
    \glt ‘We discussed that matter in the meeting.’
    \z
\z

This very point takes us back to a second question posed by the data above. What is the relevant parameter that makes agreement possible across \is{preposition}prepositions? I will assume that the T head is morphologically equivalent in all the \ili{Spanish} dialects under consideration – hence, there is no parametrically ‘tweaked’ version of T that allows for a deeper search (cf. \citealt{Chomsky2001Derivation}). I will instead argue that it is the status of P that varies, as whatever happens in these dialects affects the \textit{v}P syntax. There are three specific alternatives to implement the idea that the parameter is anchored to P:

\ea%33
    Parametrizing P\label{ex:gallego:33}\\
    \ea P is external to the VP (as in \citeauthor{Kayne2004}'s 2004 analysis of causatives)
    \ex P is inserted at PF (as a dissociated morpheme)
    \ex P is reanalyzed with V
\z
\z

The first option is tempting in the case of the hybrid pattern, where the \isi{preposition} has a clear-cut functional nature – like \is{complementizer}complementizers, as \citet{Kayne2004} argues. This is in fact the approach that \citet{Ordóñez2016} put forward in their analysis of \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM, whose derivation is reproduced in (35) for a sentence like (34):\largerpage[-1]

\ea%34

    \z
\z

Suppose that, following the logic of these authors’ analysis, the differential marker is introduced above the TP (not the \textit{v}P), then there is no obstacle preventing T’s $\varphi ${}-Probe from matching the IA. It is not obvious, though, that the same idea should be adopted for \is{preposition}prepositions that have a semantic flavor, like many of those featured in the examples above. For this very reason, it is not obvious that the analysis in (34) can be phrased in terms of PF insertion: the \is{preposition}prepositions in (27), (28) and (29) are not dissociated morphemes. We are left, therefore, with some variant of the reanalysis approach (cf. \citealt{Hornstein1981,Kayne1975,Kayne2004}, among many others). Of course, notice that it must be the case that the \isi{preposition} is not heading an \isi{adjunct}, since these seem to block agreement at all costs. Hence, the examples in (36) are totally out:



\ea%36
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:36}\\
    \ea[*]{
    \gll Se  \textbf{trabajaron}  en  \textbf{las} \textbf{reuniones}.   \\
         \textsc{se}   work.\textsc{3pl}     in  the meetings\\
    \glt ‘People worked in the meetings.’  }
    \ex[*]{

    \glt ‘The President was criticized for various reasons.’  }
    \z
\z    

Consequently, the V-P reanalysis option seems to be necessary with some \is{preposition}prepositions. Accordingly, the process depicted in (36) seems to be relevant for capturing the data in (27), (28) and (29):


\ea%37
    \label{ex:gallego:37}
    \ea\onehalfspacing\relax [ SE \ConnectTail{\textbf{T}} ($\varphi $-Probe)  [\textsubscript{VP} V \ldots\xspace [  P \ConnectHead{\textbf{XP}} (\isi{Goal}) ] ] ] (P = full-fledged \isi{preposition})

Literally, what (37) is saying is that P is incorporated into V so that the XP \isi{Goal} is probeable by T and agreement can take place. This raises interesting typological questions of the sort involved in teasing apart satellite-framed and verb-framed languages (cf. \citealt{Mateu2012} and references therein). An observation to keep in mind in order to support the Probe-\isi{Goal} analysis is that, again, agreement is only in number (cf. \citealt{Etxepare2006}), as the following asymmetries reveal:



\ea[*]{%38
         \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:38}\nopagebreak\\
    \gll Se \{pensa-mos/-áis\}   en  \{nosotros / vosotros\}.      \\
         \textsc{se}   think-\textsc{1pl/-2pl}     in    we      /      you.\textsc{pl}\\
    \glt ‘We/you are thought about.’ }
    \z
    
Finally, there is evidence arguing against the existence of a non-referential (\isi{indefinite}) \textsc{3pl} pronoun (cf. \citealt{Suñer1983,Cabredo2003}). These pronouns can be spelled out, and then the non-referential reading is lost. However, these sentences reject the spell-out of a pronoun. So, the following is possible:

\ea%39
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:39}\\
    \gll En España, (ellos)  se  acuestan            tarde.    \\
         in  Spain       they   \textsc{se} go.to.bed.\textsc{3pl}   late\\
    \glt ‘In Spain, (they/people) go to bed late.’
    \z

But the following is not:

\ea%40
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:40}\\
    \gll En la   reunión, (*ellos)  se   hablaron     de  temas muy importantes.  \\
         in  the  meeting   they   \textsc{se} talked.\textsc{3pl}  of  topics very important\\
    \glt ‘Very important topics were talked about in the meeting.’
    \z

And the same holds if the subject is \isi{indefinite}, which can also trigger the \isi{impersonal} reading that the sentences we are considering deploy:

\ea%41
    \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:41}\\
    \gll En la    reunión, (*algunos) se hablaron   de  temas  muy importantes.\\
         in   the meeting  some     \textsc{se} talked.\textsc{3pl}   of  topics  very important\\
    \glt ‘Very important topics were talked about in the meeting.’
    \z

Nonetheless, definiteness does seem to be relevant when it comes to the \isi{Goal} of the agreement process. Consider the following examples, which indicate that the more \isi{indefinite} it is, the more possible the agreement dependency becomes:

Although I cannot go into the details, all of this suggests that there are deeper layers of analysis around this phenomenon, indicating that the type of \isi{Goal} has a role in determining how good agreement is.


\section{Conclusions}% 5. 
This paper has discussed new data from \ili{Spanish} dialects concerning agreement in SE sentences. Although this is a well-known topic in the literature, the previous pages have shown that along with the “hybrid pattern”, some dialects of \ili{Spanish} display a \is{passive!pseudopassive}pseudopassive structure of sorts. Needless to say, a more careful empirical study is needed, and the factors to control for are the following: (i) the type of verb (non-pronominal, agentive, etc.) that allows \is{passive!pseudopassive}pseudopassives, (ii) the \isi{preposition} that allows agreement, (iii) the type of \isi{Goal} (\CATDP, \CATNP, bare plural, etc.), and (iv) the source from which the data have been obtained. 

I have argued against the possibility that the facts can be considered as typos or oral errors. There are various arguments for rejecting that possibility: the pattern does not appear in isolated online hits (we could add more examples to the data in (27), (28) and (29)), one cannot find analogous examples with \is{adjunct}adjuncts (see (36)), and similar agreement facts are found with \is{Differential Object Marking}\DOM and partitive \is{preposition}prepositions, as noted by \citet{Treviño2010} for Mexican \ili{Spanish}:

 
\ea%43
    Mexican \ili{Spanish}\label{ex:gallego:43}\\
    \gll Por  aquí   \textbf{pasaron}      de  \textbf{esos}   \textbf{aviones}. \\
         by    here  passed.\textsc{3pl}  of  those  planes\\
    \glt ‘Some of those planes passed by here.’
\z

The descriptive and theoretical consequences of the discussion above are not minor. It forces us not only to reconsider the distinction between different types of \is{preposition}prepositions in \ili{Spanish} (and other languages; cf. \citealt{Demonte1987,Demonte1991,Demonte1995,Abels2003,Cuervo2003,Pesetsky2004,Romero2011}), but also to sharpen our analysis of how micro- and macroparameters interact. Since the agreement data reported here align with phenomena that concern the V-P connection, we are in a good position to improve our understanding of linguistic variation, typological correlations, and language contact.
