The present book is a thoroughly revised version of a substantial part of my PhD dissertation, defended in May 2017 \parencite{VanRooy2017}. As such, it is an outcome of a four-year PhD fellowship, generously granted by the Research Foundation â€“ Flanders (FWO) and conducted at KU Leuven, my main alma mater. The research leading up to this monograph was carried out in the best possible circumstances at the Leuven Center for the Historiography of Linguistics (CHL), where I could enjoy the invaluable guidance of two of the finest mentors, Toon Van Hal and Pierre Swiggers. This book has greatly benefitted from their feedback as well as from that of the two other members of my supervisory committee, John Considine and Lambert Isebaert. Special thanks are due to the latter, as it was under his supervision that I first embarked on studying the fascinating history of Greek dialectology during my studies at UCLouvain in 2012/2013. Many chapters of the book were written and finalized during a long research stay in the ancient capital of eloquence and elegance, Athens, in the Winter semester of 2018/2019, made possible by an FWO travel grant. I am also much indebted to the editorial care of James McElvenny, who greatly improved the English phrasing in numerous instances, and to Felix Kopecky, Nina Markl, and Sebastian Nordhoff for their typesetting efforts. Finally, I warmly thank the countless proofreaders for their meticulous corrections and valuable suggestions.

I gratefully dedicate the book to my parents, whose unconditional love has been a tremendous
stimulus to pursue my passions. Were it not for their patience and commitment, this book would have
never seen the light of day. To my wife Elien I owe thanks for innumerable things: for her continuous
support and for following me wherever my research brings me, even if that means getting lost in the
labyrinth of streets, mountains, and islands that is Greece.\\\\
