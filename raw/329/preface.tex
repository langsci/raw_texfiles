\addchap{Preface}
The editors of this volume wish to thank the Institute for Language and Folklore (Isof) in Gothenburg, Østfold University College, the University of Oslo, and the Research Council of Norway (through the project \textit{Variation and Change in the Scandinavian Verb Phrase}, grant no. 250755) for financing our work. In addition, we are grateful to all the anonymous reviewers who kindly agreed to scrutinize the contributions to this volume. Many thanks also to series editors Michael T. Putnam, B. Richard Page, and Laura Catharine Smith for including the volume in the series \textit{Open Germanic Linguistics}, to Mary Chambers for proof-reading the chapters, and to Sebastian Nordhoff and Felix Kopecky at Language Science Press for helping us turn the manuscript into a book.
In the spring of 2021, one of the contributors to this volume, Cecilia Falk (Cia), was diagnosed with cancer, and she passed away on July 21. We miss her greatly: her warm and sincere friendship, as well as her lively and sharp intellect. Cia’s importance for Scandinavian historical linguistics is hard to overrate, and her influence is visible throughout this volume. It is hardly surprising that her dissertation \citep{Falk1993}, which still today sets the standard for methodological excellence, is the most prominently occurring reference in the volume. When Cia left us, she had been working on a massive reference grammar of Old Swedish for almost two decades, together with her oldest colleague Lars-Olof Delsing. As always in her work, she combined careful investigation of the historical sources with theoretically guided analysis, as well as an open-minded and deliberate consideration of previous work. Up until now, we knew who to turn to when we needed a guide in our inquiries into older Swedish, be it a quirky example in need of interpretation or a syntactic construction in need of exemplification. In some sense of the word, we are all Cia’s students.
Apart from some last formal adjustments, Cia completed all revisions and submitted a final version of her paper in this volume before she died. We dedicate the volume to her memory.
