This book is the culmination of ten years of thinking and writing about internalist semantics and the nature of meaning. During those years I have benefitted from discussion with many colleagues and friends in various universities, conferences, and personal correspondences. I would like to especially thank Peter Slezak, Nick Riemer, Mengistu Amberber, Debra Aarons, Michael Levot, Justin Colley, and all the regular participants at the cognitive science discussion group at the University of New South Wales who read drafts of some of the chapters in this book.

I am also grateful to Language Science Press and to the Conceptual Foundations of Language Science series editors and reviewers. Lastly, I would like to thank all the proofreaders for their careful and helpful feedback.
