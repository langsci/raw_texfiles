This book is a slightly altered version of my PhD dissertation, which I probably would never have completed without the support of a number of great people.

Thank you to my supervisor Ingo Plag without whom this book would have never been written. Ingo, you stood by my side from day one, answering my innumerous questions,  listening to my ideas and constantly giving me new input. You gave me space when I needed it, and pushed me when it was necessary. During this project, I have learned more than I could have ever imagined, and for that I will be grateful forever.

Thank you to Melanie Bell, who did not only give me the opportunity to conduct my experiments in her home town but also opened her home to me. 
Thank you also to the other members of my dissertation committee, Heidrun Dorgeloh and Ruben van de Vijver, especially for their helpful and always encouraging comments. 

Thank you to Gero Kunter who was the first to spark my interest in linguistics and empirical studies. Gero, I have learned so much from you that it does not even make sense to start listing it here. Thank you for being there from start to finish.

Thank you to Sabine Arndt-Lappe without whom I would never have started my PhD. Sabine, you have never failed to encourage me, and you supported me with both professional and personal advice. Thank you for all you have done for me.

Thank you to everyone in the DFG research unit \textit{Spoken Morphology} for patiently listening to numerous talks about \isi{gemination}, and never getting tired of providing new insights. Each of you contributed to this project in a unique way, and I am very grateful for having had the opportunity to work with you.

Thank you to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft for funding the research unit, and thus giving me the opportunity to fully concentrate on my thesis for three years.

Thank you to the Cambridge Phonetics Laboratory, especially to Francis Nolan, for welcoming me twice and allowing me to conduct my experiments. Without you there would be no experimental data, and without experimental data, there would be no \chapref{Experimental Studies}.


Thank you to everyone I worked with in the English linguistics department at the Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf. Working on your PhD is much easier when you have a great team of colleagues who support you. 
Christian, thank you for always finding the time to give me advice, whether it is on phonological theory, teaching or simply hanging in there. 
Julia and Katja, you were my role models and have shown me how it's done. Thank you for leading the way.
Julia, Lea, Annika and Jessica, doing a PhD is not easy but having friends who do it with you makes it much easier. Thank you, for listening to my complaints, cheering me up when I was down, reading  and commenting on my chapters, and simply being there.
Ulrike, there is nothing you cannot do. Thank you for always being there.

Thank you to Heike, Fabian, Simon, Mandy, Yannick, Lara and Viktoria for the innumerous hours they spent in front of praat. ``John says \textit{thank you} again''.  
Thank you especially to Simon who supported me at various stages of this project, from segmenting the first files to proof reading the last version.

Danke an meine Familie, die mich immer daran erinnert hat, dass es noch mehr im Leben gibt als Geminaten, sound files und statistische Modelle. Mama, Papa, Nadia, Süleyman, Ayla und Ismail, ich danke euch für eure Geduld und Unterstützung.

John, I thank you and Owen for your patience and support. You believed in me from day one, and you were right.
