This book is published under the open-access scheme in online form. In addition, thanks to the funding obtained from the \isi{European Commission} to cover production costs, the book will be printed in 250 copies at the end of 2017. The print version of the book will be distributed free of charge throughout Europe to relevant libraries and universities. The \isi{European Commission}’s funding also covered the Kraków and Prague conferences held as part of the Translating Europe project.

We wish to thank the publishing house Language Science Press, whose publishing project is concerned not only with Linguistics, but also, among other fields of enquiry, with Translation Studies. Language Science Press's lean structure made it possible to flexibly cater for our needs to publish the book within considerable time and cost constraints.

The editors wish to thank all the numerous peer reviewers who reviewed and commented on individual contributions.
