\title{Unifying structural and lexical case assignment in Dependent Case Theory}  

\author{Zorica Puškar\affiliation{Leibniz-Zentrum Allgemeine Sprachwissenschaft, Berlin}\lastand  Gereon Müller\affiliation{University of Leipzig}}

\abstract{Dependent Case Theory argues against case assignment via a functional head (cf. \citealt{Chomsky2000,chomsky01}) and proposes instead that case is a result of a structural relation between two DPs \citep{marantz91,mcfadden04,bakervinokurova,baker15}. However, Dependent Case Theory cannot completely abandon case assignment via a syntactic head, as this mechanism accounts for lexical case (e.g. lexical dative). Furthermore, structural and lexical datives are morphologically identical and often behave similarly, and `just where the line should be drawn between the two is a theoretical matter' \citep[13]{baker15}. We argue for a unified approach to lexical and structural dative case assignment under Dependent Case Theory, implemented in a derivational fashion, via the operation Agree. While structural \datt{} is assigned as a high dependent case in the VP in the presence of a lower (later \accc{}) DP, lexical \datt{} is assigned in the same configuration, in the VP, in the presence of another silent or overt co-argument DP.

\section{Introduction: Dependent Case Theory} 


The Dependent Case Theory (henceforth DCT) is a result of the work of \citep{marantz91,mcfadden04,bakervinokurova,baker12,baker15}, among others, adopting similar ideas by \citet{yipetal87,bittnerhale96,kiparsky92,kiparsky2001,wunderlich97,stiebels2002}. Case assignment in DCT relies primarily on \citeauthor{marantz91}'s (\citeyear[24]{marantz91}) disjunctive case hierarchy, which distinguishes between the following types of case:

\ea Lexically governed case \before{} Dependent case (\isi{accusative} and \isi{ergative}) \before{} Unmarked case (\isi{nominative} and absolutive) \before{} Default case 
\z

\noindent There are several steps in the case assigning process. In Step 1 all DPs selected by lexical items (verbs, prepositions, etc.) which idiosyncratically assign a particular case, receive the \textsc{lexically governed case} value from the designated head upon c-selection. In Step 2, pairs of remaining caseless DPs are inspected in their local domains. \textsc{Dependent case} is assigned to them according to (a variation of) the following \isi{case assignment} rules: 

\ea\label{16:ex2} \textbf{Rules for dependent case assignment} \citep[48-49]{baker15}
\ea\label{16:ex2a} If there are two distinct DPs in the same spell out domain such that DP$_1$ c-commands DP$_2$, then value the \isi{case feature} of DP$_2$ as \isi{accusative} unless DP$_1$ has already been marked for case \REF{16:ex3}. 
\ex\label{16:ex2b} If there are two distinct DPs in the same spell out domain such that DP$_1$ c-commands DP$_2$, then value the \isi{case feature} of DP$_1$ as \isi{ergative} unless DP$_2$ has already been marked for case \REF{16:ex4}. 
\z \z

\noindent These rules lead to a four-way typology of case alignments \citep{levinpreminger}: The application of only the rule \REF{16:ex2a} will lead to nominative-\isi{accusative} alignment \REF{16:ex3}, while \REF{16:ex2b} will yield ergative-absolutive alignment \REF{16:ex4}. If both parameters are simultaneously present in the same language, this would yield tripartite case systems (e.g. Nez Perce, where \isi{accusative} and \isi{ergative} can co-occur, see \citealt{baker15}) and if both parameters are switched off, the language has neither \isi{ergative} nor \isi{accusative} case marking.

\noindent In Step 3, the remaining DPs that have not received case by means of competition with another DP, receive the \textsc{unmarked case}, which depends on the local domain in which the NP is found (\isi{nominative}/absolutive in TP/CP, \isi{genitive} in DP). Finally, \textsc{default case} is assigned to fragment answers and free-standing DPs (\textit{Who bought the bread? Him./*He.}).


One of the evident problems for DCT is that \datt{} can be assigned either in Step 1, as lexically governed case, or in Step 2, as dependent case. If assigned as dependent case, \datt{} is considered to be assigned to a higher DP in the VP \citep{bakervinokurova,baker15}, which means that the \isi{case feature} on a \isi{dative} DP can sometimes be supplied by a lexical head and sometimes in a particular configuration in the VP and even though this feature has two completely different sources in the syntax, it is still recognised and realised as the same exponent by the morphology. We propose instead that assignment of \isi{dative} via a lexical head can be abandoned in DCT. We claim that \datt{} can always be treated as dependent case assigned to a higher DP in a VP. In line with proposals by \citet{bittnerhale96,baker15} (for \isi{case assignment} in general), \citet{wood2016} (for lexical \isi{accusative} case in \ili{Icelandic}), and \citet{bakerbobaljik} (for inherent \isi{ergative} case), instead of assuming that a verb comes with a lexical [$*$\datt$*$] \isi{case feature} \REF{16:ex5}, we propose that the verb comes with a covert pseudo co-argument DP, which enables the assignment of lexical \isi{dative} as dependent case to a higher DP in a VP \REF{16:ex6}.

\noindent Furthermore, there is an ongoing debate within the DCT on the timing of \isi{case assignment}. While some authors want \isi{case assignment} to be a syntactic process (see \citealt{preminger-book} and \citealt{baker15}, who times \isi{case assignment} at Spell-Out, during linearization), others argue that dependent case is assigned at PF \citep{marantz91,mcfadden04,bobaljikphi}. In what follows, we will take the syntactic side of the debate and offer a derivational implementation via the operation Agree between two DPs, which will derive dependent \isi{case assignment} as a narrow syntactic process, and explain the \isi{dative} puzzle outlined above. 



\section{Structural dative in Serbian}

In order to derive the assignment of structural \isi{dative} case in \isi{double object} constructions, this section offers a short empirical introduction on the structural relations between \nomm, \accc{} and \datt{} arguments in \ili{BCS}. The order of the \isi{indirect object} (\isi{IO}) and the \isi{direct object} (\isi{DO}) is mostly free in \ili{Serbian} and both orders can be used in neutral contexts:

\ea\label{16:doubleobject1}
\ea\label{16:doubleobject1a} \gll Slavica je predstavila sestri Marka.\\
Slavica.\nomm{} is presented sister.\datt{} Marko.\accc\\
\glt `Slavica presented Marko to her sister.'\hfill V \before{} \datt{} \before{} \accc{}
\ex \label{16:doubleobject1b}\gll Slavica je predstavila Marka sestri.\\
Slavica.\nomm{} is presented Marko.\accc{} sister.\datt{}\\
\glt `Slavica presented Marko to her sister.'\hfill V \before{} \accc{} \before{} \datt{}
\z \z

\noindent However, there is reason to believe that \isi{IO} \before{} \isi{DO}, i.e. \REF{16:doubleobject1a} is the base order of the two objects, while \REF{16:doubleobject1b} is derived by A-movement. The evidence from quantifier scope \citep{aoun89,frey1989,bruening2001} shows that,  while in the V \before{} \datt{} \before{} \accc{} order only the reading where the quantifier in the \isi{IO} scopes over the one in the \isi{DO} is available \REF{16:ex8a}, the order V \before{} \accc{} \before{} \datt{} allows for both readings \REF{16:quantifierscope}. The availability of the reading where the existential quantifier outscopes the universal one in \REF{16:quantifierscope} indicates that the \isi{DO} can reconstruct in its base position, below the \isi{IO}. 

\ea\label{16:ex8} 
\ea\label{16:ex8a}\gll Slavica je predstavila [$_{\datt{}}$ jednoj drugarici] [$_{\accc{}}$ svakog momka].\\
Slavica is introduced {} one.\datt{} friend.\datt{} {} every.\accc{} boyfriend.\accc\\
\glt `Slavica introduced every boyfriend to a friend.'\hfill  $\exists>\forall$, *$\forall>\exists$ 
\ex\label{16:quantifierscope}\gll Slavica je predstavila [$_{\accc{}}$ svakog momka] [$_{\datt{}}$ jednoj drugarici].\\
Slavica is introduced {} every.\accc{} boyfriend.\accc{} {} one.\datt{} friend.\datt\\
\glt `Slavica introduced every boyfriend to a friend.'\hfill $\exists>\forall$, $\forall>\exists$ 
\z \z

\noindent Furthermore, maximal focus projection (from a focused NP to the entire \isi{clause}) is possible only if we maintain the base \isi{word order} (\citealt{hoehle82,vonstechowuhmann,haider92}). A sentence in which movement has occurred should not be a good answer to the question \textit{What happened?/What's new?}.\footnote{\citet[76]{stjepanovic-thesis} offers a similar argument for Serbo-\ili{Croatian}.} With the focus on the \isi{DO}, if the whole sentence is new information, focus is perceived as neutral if the sentence has the canonical \isi{word order} \REF{16:focusa}. However, the focus in \REF{16:focusb} is not necessarily new information focus, as it does not project to the entire \isi{clause}; it can be interpreted as \isi{contrastive}, which indicates that the order is not the base one and movement has taken place.\footnote{Even though the \isi{word order} in \REF{16:focusb} is neutral, as noted in \REF{16:doubleobject1b}, if the \datt{} argument is focused, the sentence sounds less neutral than its counterpart in \REF{16:focusa}. We thank an anonymous reviewer for this insight. Moreover, factors such as animacy and givenness may contribute to enabling other orders in neutral contexts; see recent findings by  \citet{titov17} for \ili{Russian} and \citet{velnic-diss} for \ili{Croatian}.}    

\ea `What happened?'
\ea[]{\gll[\hspace{-2pt} Slavica je poslala Marku \textsc{pismo} ]\\
{} Slavica is sent Marko.\datt{} letter.\accc\\
\glt `Slavica sent a letter to Marko.'}\label{16:focusa}
\ex[\#]{\gll [\hspace{-2pt} Slavica je poslala pismo \textsc{Marku} ]\\
{} Slavica is sent letter.\accc{} Marko.\datt\\
\glt `Slavica sent a letter to Marko.' / `It was Marko who Slavica sent a letter to.'}\label{16:focusb}
\z \z


\noindent Finally, the order of object clitics in \ili{Serbian} is always \datt{} \before{} \accc, regardless of the order \isi{IO} and \isi{DO} \isi{noun} phrases. \citet{stjepanovic-thesis} and \citet{Boskovic2001NatureSyntaxPhonology} assume that clitics move outside of their VP into Agr projections. The strict hierarchy between them suggests that this movement respects superiority.\largerpage[2]

\noindent We conclude from these tests that the base \isi{word order} of objects in \ili{Serbian} is \isi{IO} \before{} \isi{DO}. 

\section{A derivational account of dependent case assignment}
 
Following \citet{bakervinokurova,baker15,preminger-book,levinpreminger}, we assume that case is assigned in \isi{narrow syntax}. We adopt \isi{case feature} notations from Lexical Decomposition Grammar, following \citet{kiparsky92,kiparsky2001,wunderlichjoppen,wunderlich97,stiebels2002}:

\ea
\ea \accc: [+hr] `there is a higher role'
\ex \datt: [+hr +lr] `there is a higher role and there is a lower role'
\ex \ergg: [+lr] `there is a lower role' 
\ex \nomm/\abss: [{} {}] no case features 
\z \z


\noindent The features \hr{} and \lr{} are assigned in the course of the derivation to argument DPs via the operation Agree. We assume that both standard `downward' Agree and `upward' Agree \citep[see][]{chomsky86,chomsky91,kayne89,pollock89,koopman06} are possible options in the grammar (see also \citealt[92f.]{abels-phases} as well as \citeauthor{baker-agrbook}'s \citeyear[155]{baker-agrbook} \textit{Direction of Agreement Parameter}). We propose that Agree applies between two DPs in a c-command relationship. When Downward Agree (\down) applies, the higher of the two DPs in an asymmetric c-command relation probes down and receives the \lr{} from the lower one (see \REF{16:lr} below), and by Upward Agree (\up), the lower DP probes upward and receives its \hr{} \isi{case feature} from the higher DP (see \REF{16:hr} below). An important principle is that case valuation cannot take place if the \textit{goal DP} already has a valued \isi{case feature} \citep{bittnerhale96,baker15}. One DP can participate in multiple Agree operations as a \textit{probe} and, in principle, this can result in a DP receiving more than one \isi{case feature}, as demonstrated shortly below \REF{16:lrhr}. Moreover, in a \nomm/\accc{} system, \down{} always precedes \up. Finally, in a nominative-\isi{accusative} alignment, assignment of \lr{} in Spec\littlev{}P must somehow be pre-empted, otherwise the DP would receive \isi{ergative} case. We assume that languages with nominative-{\linebreak}\isi{accusative} alignment have an \textit{\isi{ergative} switch-off parameter}, regulated by the following principle: In a \nomm-\accc{} language the higher DP in a \textit{v}P cannot be case-valued.\footnote{Alternatively, assuming that at the \littlev{}P level \up{} precedes \down{} yields the same results.} Finally, we assume that the domain in which the proposed operations apply is the TP. 

  
Let us apply the system to \isi{dative} \isi{case assignment}. In a double-object construction, a verb selects two objects, yielding thereby a VP with two unmarked DPs in a c-command relationship. Since this is a \nomm{}-\accc{} system, \down{} will always precede \up{}. Thus when \down{} applies, the higher of the two DPs receives a \lr{} feature from the lower one. Consequently, \up{} does not apply because the potential goal is already case-valued.

%	\vspace{0.5cm} 

\noindent After the external DP$_{3}$ is introduced in Spec\littlev{}P, we now have three DPs in the same domain. The remaining two caseless DPs are DP$_{1}$ and DP$_{3}$. When \down{} applies between the highest DP$_{3}$ in the Spec\littlev{}P and the lowest DP$_{1}$, no case valuation obtains, due to the \isi{ergative} switch-off parameter, which demands that a DP in Spec\littlev{}P cannot be case valued. \up{} thus applies afterwards, whereby the lower DP receives the \hr{} feature from the higher one \REF{16:hr}.

\noindent However, DP$_{2}$ and DP$_{3}$ still fulfil the criteria for \isi{case assignment} to apply, since they are in a c-command relationship, and the higher one is not marked for case \REF{16:lrhr}. Thus \up{} applies, providing the lower DP$_{2}$ with a \hr{} feature (and the [\hr, \lr] bundle is realised as \isi{dative}).

\noindent This implementation derives the assignment of dependent case by means of existing, independently motivated mechanisms, in a derivational manner. An interesting prediction is that at the point in the derivation before the \isi{external argument} is merged, \isi{dative} should behave in a similar way as \isi{ergative} case, as it only bears a \lr{} feature, as in \REF{16:lr}.  While we leave this point for further research, note that similarities between datives and ergatives have been reported in \ili{Basque} by \citet{arreginevins12}, in Indo-Aryan languages by \citet{butt06} and even Serbo-\ili{Croatian} by \citet{progovac13}. Another important prediction is that movement of the \isi{DO} should not affect \accc{} \isi{case assignment}, since \hr{} feature still has the necessary configuration even after movement, as shown by \REF{16:ex16}. In this process, DP$_{2}$ is first assigned the \lr{} feature by \down{} with DP$_{1}$, which is then moved, and still caseless. After DP$_{3}$ has been introduced, both DP$_{1}$ and DP$_{2}$ will receive their missing \hr{} features by \up{} with it.

\section{Lexical dative}

\subsection{Similarities between structural and lexical dative}

As noted in the introduction, the central claim of this paper is that lexical \isi{dative} case is assigned just like the structural \isi{dative}. In order to support this claim, we first demonstrate that there are indeed similarities between `structural' and `lexical' datives in their syntactic behaviour.

For instance, they act in a similar way in passivisation. In double-object constructions, only the \isi{accusative} object can be passivised, i.e. only the theme argument can alternate between \isi{accusative} and \isi{nominative}, as in \REF{16:structuraldativepassive}.

Miloš.\datt{} is been.\fsg{} given.\fsg{} book.\nomm.\fsg\\
\glt `The book was given to Miloš.'
\z \z

\noindent The \isi{dative} argument, however, cannot be turned into a subject and it never alternates \REF{16:ex18}.

\ea\label{16:ex18}
\ea[*]{\gll Miloš je bio dat knjigu.\\

Miloš.\datt{} is {} been.\msg{} {} been.\nsg{} {} given.\msg{} {} given.\nsg{} book.\nomm\\
\glt `Miloš was given a book.'}
\z \z

\noindent Unlike in \ili{Icelandic} (as described by \citealt{zaenenetal85}), \isi{dative} cannot bind a subject oriented anaphor \REF{16:ex19a} and it cannot be deleted under subject \isi{ellipsis} \REF{16:ex19b}, hence it is not a subject.

\noindent Parallel to \REF{16:structuraldativepassive} above, some constructions with lexical datives can be pasivised, as in \REF{16:lexicaldativepassive}, where the lexical \isi{dative} in \REF{16:ex20b} mirrors the structural one from \REF{16:structuraldativepassiveb}.

\ea\label{16:lexicaldativepassive}
\ea \gll Ljubica je pomogla Ani.\\

\ex \gll Ani je bilo pomognuto.\\
Ana.\datt{} is been.\nsg{} helped.\nsg\\
\glt `Ana was helped.'\label{16:ex20b}
\z \z

\noindent However, \citet{zaenenetal85} subjecthood tests also show that this \isi{dative} does not behave like a subject. It does not bind a subject-oriented anaphor \REF{16:ex21a} and it cannot be deleted under subject \isi{ellipsis} \REF{16:ex21b}, just like the structural \isi{dative} in \REF{16:dativesubjectpassive2}.\largerpage[2]

\ea[*]{\gll Ani je bilo pomognuto od strane svoje sestre.\\

\z \z
 
\noindent Moreover, as argued by \citet{maling01} and shown for \ili{German} by \citet{mcfadden04}, one of the structural asymmetries between DOs and IOs is their behaviour in nominalisations. DOs appear in \isi{genitive} when the VP is nominalised \REF{16:ex22b}, unlike both structural \REF{16:ex22c} and lexical datives \REF{16:ex23}, which do not alternate with \isi{genitive}.\footnote{A reviewer wonders about the status of \textit{darivanje Miloša} `the giving of something to Miloš.\genn' in \REF{16:ex22c}. We believe that here the \isi{genitive} of the complement of   \textit{darivati} is lexical. We leave it to \isi{future} research to explore how lexical \isi{genitive} fits into the current proposal.}

\newpage 

\noindent Finally, as argued for \ili{German} by \citet{sternefeld85,bayeretal01,mcfadden04}, in the so-called `topic drop' constructions, it is possible to omit the \accc{} \REF{16:ex25a}, but not a \datt{} topic, irrespective of whether it is structural \REF{16:ex25b} or lexical \REF{16:ex25c}.

\noindent From these similarities, we conclude that lexical and structural datives can be treated as the same type of syntactic objects.\footnote{An additional language specific test that points into the same direction is Left Branch Extraction, which is allowed out of subjects \REF{16:fn5exia} and objects \REF{16:fn5exib} in \ili{Serbian} (see \citealt{bosk2005}, and subsequent work), but seems to be disallowed both with structural \REF{16:fn5exic} and lexical \isi{dative} \REF{16:fn5exid}.

\noindent However, the acceptability of the examples varies across different speakers, and it can be also influenced by factors such as \isi{word order}. We leave this very interesting issue for \isi{future} research.} In the next sections, we will inspect different types of lexical datives we have identified in \ili{Serbian} in turn. 



\subsection{Lexical dative as dependent case}

\subsubsection{\textit{Help}-type verbs as underlying ditransitives}

\textit{Help}-type verbs include verbs such as \textit{pomoći} `help', \textit{čestitati} `congratulate', \textit{ugodi\-ti} `please', \textit{služiti} `serve', \textit{verovati} `believe', \textit{zavideti} `envy', \textit{doprineti} `contribute', etc. (a partial list from several types of monotransitive  constructions identified by \citealt{stipcevic}). We argue that these verbs are underlyingly \isi{ditransitive}, where the  DP$_{\accc}$ is present, but covert, yet even as such, it serves as a competitor for \isi{dative} \isi{case assignment}. In these constructions, the \nomm{} argument is usually an \textsc{agent}, while the \datt{} can have \textsc{be\-ne\-fi\-ciary}/\textsc{male\-fi\-ciary}/\textsc{re\-ci\-pi\-ent}/\textsc{goal}/\textsc{tar\-get person} theta-role. The unmarked \isi{word order} of arguments of \textit{help}-type verbs is \nomm{} \before{} \datt{} \REF{16:ex26}.

\ea\label{16:ex26}
\ea\gll Ljubica je pomogla svom detetu.\\
Ljubica.\nomm{} is helped \textsc{poss}.\datt{} child.\datt\\
\glt `Ljubica helped her child.'
\ex\gll Trener je  čestitao svojim igračima.\\
coach.\nomm{} is congratulated \textsc{poss}.\datt{} players.\datt\\
\glt `The coach congratulated his players.'
\z \z

\noindent A possibly crucial piece of evidence for postulating a silent DP$_{\accc}$ is that even though usually monotransitive, these constructions can have another \textit{overt} \accc{} argument:\footnote{Note a similar kind of behaviour of lexical datives in \ili{German} invoked by \citep[129]{mcfadden04}. He takes this as a piece of evidence that lexical \isi{dative} assigned by \textit{glauben}/\textit{helfen}-type verbs in \ili{German} can be analysed as structural \isi{dative}.
	
	\ea
	\ea\gll Er glaubt seinem Bruder.\\
	he.\nomm{} believes \textsc{poss}.\datt{} brother.\datt\\
	\glt `He believes his brother.'
	\ex\gll Er glaubt seinem Bruder die Geschichte.\\
	he.\nomm{} believes \textsc{poss}.\datt{} brother.\datt{} the story.\accc\\
	\glt `He believes his brother's story.'
    \z \z
	
	
}


\ea\label{16:overtsilentdp}
\ea\gll Ljubica je pomogla svom detetu školovanje.\\
Ljubica.\nomm{} is helped \textsc{poss}.\datt{} child.\datt{} education.\accc\\
\glt `Ljubica sponsored her child's education.'
\ex\gll Trener je čestitao svojim igračima pobedu.\\
coach.\nomm{} is congratulated \textsc{poss}.\datt{} players.\datt{} victory.\accc\\
\glt `The coach congratulated his players on the victory.'
\z \z


\noindent\textit{Help}-type constructions with lexical datives in \ili{Serbian} seem to be able to passivise (forming an impersonal passive construction; recall \REF{16:lexicaldativepassive}). Such evidence suggests that constructions of this type can be treated as double-object constructions, equivalent to those in \REF{16:doubleobject1}, allowing for treatment of lexical \isi{dative} as structural.



We therefore argue that constructions with the \textit{help}-type verbs are in fact double-object constructions. The lower \accc{} object is present as a silent DP (see \citealt{wood2016} for a similar proposal for lexical accusatives in \ili{Icelandic} and \citealt{bakerbobaljik} for similar ideas for \isi{ergative} case). This silent DP can sometimes be realised overtly, as in \REF{16:overtsilentdp} above. The `lexical' \isi{dative} is assigned in the same manner as in \isi{ditransitive} double-object constructions. The feature \lr{} is assigned to the higher DP at the VP level via \down. The assignment of \hr{} applies at \littlev{}P, by \up{}, which is established with the \isi{nominative} DP in Spec\littlev{}P.

\useasboundingbox (current bounding box.north west) rectangle ([yshift=-2.5ex] current bounding box.south east); 
\end{tikzpicture}\\
	\vspace{0.5cm}
\z

\noindent These constructions are therefore underlyingly true ditransitives, which explains their striking similarities to regular canonical \isi{ditransitive} constructions and the similarities in the syntactic behaviour between the datives in the two. 

\subsubsection{An extension: \textit{Adjust}-type verbs as underlying ditransitives}

Another type of verbs identified by \citet[300f.]{stipcevic} select for \isi{dative} objects where the \isi{dative} argument mostly has a \textsc{target person/goal} theta-role. Some of the verbs include: \textit{odužiti se} `pay back', \textit{osvetiti se} `take revenge', \textit{suprotstaviti se} `confront', \textit{predati se} `give in/give up', \textit{oteti se} `escape', \textit{priključiti se} `join', \textit{prilagoditi se} `adjust', etc. Most of these verbs contain the morpheme \textit{se}, which mostly has a reflexive interpretation. The \isi{nominative} argument is usually an \textsc{agent} in these sentences and the unmarked order is \nomm{} \before{} \datt{} \REF{16:lexicaladjust}.

\ea\label{16:lexicaladjust}
\ea\label{16:ex29a}\gll Tamara se prilagodila situaciji.\\
Tamara.\nomm{} \textsc{refl} adjusted.\fsg{} situation.\datt\\
\glt `Tamara adjusted to the situation.'
\ex\label{16:ex29b}\gll Srdjan se predao policiji.\\
Srdjan.\nomm{} \textsc{refl} surrendered.\msg{} police.\datt\\
\glt `Srdjan surrendered to the police.'
\z \z

\noindent Another overt \accc{} argument can be added, but in that case the morpheme \textit{se} cannot appear in the sentence. Comparing \REF{16:ex29a}/\REF{16:ex29b} with \REF{16:ex30a}/\REF{16:ex30b} respectively, we can see that \textit{se} and \accc{} seem to be in \isi{complementary distribution}. \textit{Se} therefore seems to absorb \accc{} case (see also \citealt{franks95}).\footnote{Passivisation is unfortunately inconclusive as a test. Sentences with an overt \isi{accusative} can be passivized regularly \REF{16:fn7exia}, but the ones without the overt \accc{} argument and with the \textit{se} morpheme cannot be \REF{16:fn7exib}.  
	
	\ea
	\ea[]{\gll Ponašanje je bilo prilagodjeno situaciji.\\
	behaviour.\nomm.\nsg{} is been adjusted.\nsg{} situation.\datt\\
	\glt `The behaviour was adjusted to the situation.}\label{16:fn7exia}
	\ex[*]{\gll Situaciji se / je bilo prilagodjeno.\\
	situation.\datt{} \textsc{refl} {} is been.\nsg{} adjusted.\nsg\\\\
	intended: `One adjusted to the situation.'}\label{16:fn7exib}
	\ex[]{\gll Situaciji se prilagodilo.\\
	situation.\datt{} \textsc{refl} adjusted.\nsg\\\\
	\glt `One adjusted to the situation.'}\label{16:fn7exic}
    \z \z

\noindent	As \REF{16:fn7exic} shows, the only possible `passive' form with these constructions is actually impersonal middle construction, which is expected if these constructions even in the active voice already involve argument reduction (see \citealt{progovac13,marelj04}).}

\ea\label{16:structuraladjust}
\ea\label{16:ex30a}\gll Tamara je (*\hspace{-2pt} se) prilagodila ponašanje situaciji.\\
Tamara.\nomm{} is {} \textsc{refl} adjusted.\fsg{} behaviour.\accc{} situation.\datt\\
\glt `Tamara adjusted her behaviour to the situation.'
\ex\label{16:ex30b}\gll Srdjan je (*\hspace{-2pt} se) predao dokumente policiji.\\
Srdjan.\nomm{} is {} \textsc{refl} submitted.\msg{} documents.\accc{} police.\datt\\
\glt `Srdjan submitted the documents to the police.'
\z \z

\noindent The similarities between \REF{16:structuraladjust} and \REF{16:lexicaladjust} above can be captured by the derivations in \REF{16:ex31} and \REF{16:ex32}. While verbs with `structural' \isi{dative} contain an overt DP as a \isi{DO}, \textit{adjust}-type verbs contain a silent DP. Crucially, the \lr{} feature is assigned to the higher of the two DPs in the VP. While in \REF{16:ex31} the lower DP receives the \hr{} feature and thereby \accc{} case upon merging the \isi{external argument}, in \REF{16:ex32}, the lower DP argument in the VP is reduced (or alternatively it starts out as a null DP) and becomes realised by \textit{se}.

    \z
	\vspace{1.5cm}	
	
	
\subsubsection{\textit{Belong}-type verbs as unaccusative ditransitives}

{Belong}-type verbs include verbs such as \textit{pripadati} `belong', \textit{zapasti} `get into/end up with', \textit{nedostajati} `miss', etc. (see also \citealt{stipcevic}). We argue that these verbs are underlyingly \isi{ditransitive} as well, but they do not take an \isi{external argument} and are, therefore, \isi{unaccusative}. The \nomm{} argument is usually a \textsc{theme}, while \datt{} is usually interpreted as \textsc{possessor}. The unmarked \isi{word order} is \nomm{} \before{} \datt{}, as illustrated by \REF{16:ex33}.

\ea\label{16:ex33}\gll Ova kapa pripada Ani.\\
this.\nomm{} cap.\nomm{} belongs Ana.\datt\\
\glt `This cap belongs to Ana.'
\z

\noindent No additional overt \isi{accusative} arguments can be added to these verbs and a structure like this cannot be passivised \REF{16:ex34}. The impossibility of passivization, the lack of overt \isi{accusative} argument and the theme interpretation of the \nomm{} argument suggest therefore that such constructions are essentially \isi{unaccusative}. The idea that the \nomm{} argument is introduced as the \isi{internal argument} of the verb, which is later moved to the sentence-initial position, can be supported by evidence from quantifier scope. In \REF{16:ex35}, the possibility for the existential quantifier to outscope the universal one indicates that the  \nomm{} argument has been moved and is able to reconstruct in its base position.\footnote{This situation mirrors the one in \REF{16:quantifierscope}. Note that since \ili{Serbian} is a rigid scope language, only movement can affect quantifier scope, thus the reading here cannot be derived by quantifier raising of the existential quantifier and must instead involve movement (see \citealt{antonyk15}).}

\ea[*]{\gll Ani je bilo pripadano.\\
Ana.\datt{} is been.\nsg{} belonged.\datt\\\\
\glt *`It was belonged to Ana.'}\label{16:ex34}
\z

\ea[]{\gll [$_{\accc{}}$ Svaka kapa] pripada [$_{\datt{}}$ jednoj devojci].\\
{} every.\nomm{} cap.\nomm{} belongs {} one.\datt{} girl.\datt\\
\glt `Every cap belongs to one girl.'\hfill $\exists>\forall$, $\forall>\exists$ }\label{16:ex35}
\z

\noindent In order to derive this type of lexical \isi{dative} as dependent case, we assume that the two internal arguments of these verbs are both merged as the arguments of V, as in \REF{16:unaccusatives}. In this configuration, \down{} applies first and the higher DP receives the \lr{} feature from the lower one. The lower DP does not receive any case features at the VP level. Since these verbs are \isi{unaccusative}, no \isi{external argument} is merged in Spec\littlev{}P. However, the \textsc{theme} argument must move up in order to become the (derived) subject of the sentence. In order to move to SpecTP, it has to move through the \littlev{}P phase edge \citep{legate03}. At the \littlev{}P edge, this DP can now serve as a case competitor again. After \down{} fails due to the \isi{ergative} switch-off parameter that precludes case valuation in Spec\littlev{}P, \up{} succeeds, and \hr{} is assigned to the \datt{} DP \REF{16:unaccusatives2}.

\noindent In conclusion, treating these constructions as unaccusatives correctly captures the fact that they cannot passivize and that the DP$_{\nomm}$ is interpreted as a \textsc{theme} rather than \textsc{agent}, thereby enabling a unified treatment of lexical and structural \isi{dative} as dependent case.

\subsection{An extension: (\textit{feel})-\textit{like}-type verbs as unaccusative ditransitives}

(\textit{Feel})-\textit{like}-type verbs select for an \textsc{experiencer}-type \isi{dative} argument, as in \REF{16:ex38}. The unmarked \isi{word order} seems to be \datt{} \before{} \nomm.

\ea[]{\gll Ani se svidja zelena haljina.\\
Ana.\datt{} \textit{se} appeals green.\nomm{} dress.\nomm\\
\glt `Ana likes the green dress.'}\label{16:ex38}
\z

\noindent As with the previous group, no additional overt \isi{accusative} arguments can be added to this structure. Moreover, a structure like this cannot be passivised \REF{16:ex39}. 

\ea[*]{\gll Ani je bilo svidjano.\\
Ana.\datt{} is been appealed.\nsg\\
\glt `It was appealed to Ana.'}\label{16:ex39}
\z

\noindent The lack of passivization possibility and the overt \isi{accusative} argument, together with the theme interpretation of the \nomm{} argument suggest that this could be an \isi{unaccusative} contruction. The \textit{se} \isi{clitic}, however, does not have a reflexive interpretation, but following \citet{progovac13}, it can be assumed to be an expletive object \isi{pronoun}. Based on the fact that these verbs cannot assign \isi{accusative} and that the DP$_{\nomm}$ is ambiguous between subject and object interpretation, \citet{progovac13} argues that the structures like these are in fact instances of an ergative-absolutive pattern in a language like \ili{Serbian}. Such sentences would be analysed as in \REF{16:unaccusatives} and \REF{16:unaccusatives2} above. The \lr{} feature is assigned to the higher DP at the VP level via \down, while the \hr{} feature is assigned at the \littlev{}P level via \up. We leave the exact nature of the \isi{clitic} \textit{se} in these constructions for \isi{future} research, which should be able to tell whether it is an additional silent argument that absorbs certain case features, or whether it is an expletive.	

\section{Conclusion}

Dependent \isi{case assignment} can be formalised by means of a derivational approach, where case features are assigned incrementally, via an Agree operation which holds between two DPs. \datt{} is assigned as high dependent case in the VP, while \accc{} is the low dependent case in the \littlev{}P. We have seen evidence from \ili{Serbian} that the account of structural \datt{} can be extended to cover the assignment of lexical \datt. Lexical \isi{dative} is thus assigned in the same configurations: (i) in a \isi{ditransitive} double-object construction with a silent DP as \isi{DO} and a case competitor, (ii) in a \isi{double object construction} involving an \isi{unaccusative} verb. In its strictest form therefore, the Dependent Case Theory can capture assignment of both lexical and structural \isi{dative} case as dependent case.
