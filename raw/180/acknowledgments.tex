This edited volume is the outcome of intensive collaboration and cross-ferti\-li\-za\-tion within the ALLENCAM research group. It owes its existence to a shared interest in examining language acquisition in different contexts. It is the culmination of several years of work carried out with constant mutual support, which is the best source of motivation and enjoyment when conducting research. Above all, we are grateful for the inspiring work carried out by all contributors, who have made the task of editing easy for us.
We would particularly like to thank the Series Editor, Gabriele Pallotti, as the final quality of texts has substantially improved under his wise supervision and also Amanda Edmonds, whose advice has been invaluable. We are indebted for the financial support granted by the Spanish MICINN (through grant FFI2013-48640.C2-1-P) and the AGAUR (through grant SGR240).
