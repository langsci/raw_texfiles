\section{M\=/forms before vowel-initial enclitics}\label{sec:MforBefEnc}
In addition to the basic M\=/form (\M) and the M\=/form
before modifiers with an initial consonant cluster (\Mc),
there is an M\=/form used before vowel-initial enclitics.
Unlike the other M\=/forms, this M\=/form does not have a morphological
use but is phonologically conditioned.
The way in which this M\=/form is derived is discussed
in full detail in Chapter \ref{ch:PhoMet}.

There are three phonological processes which clitic
hosts undergo before a vowel-initial enclitic:
metathesis, consonant insertion, and vowel assimilation.
Each of these processes can be analysed as
phonologically conditioned by the presence of the vowel-initial enclitic.
A full overview and analysis of all these processes
is given in Chapter \ref{ch:PhoMet}.
