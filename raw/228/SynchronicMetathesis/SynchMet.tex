\chapter{Synchronic metathesis from a cross-linguistic perspective} \label{ch:SynchMet}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter I discuss synchronic metathesis
from a cross-linguistic perspective.
I begin in \srf{sec:KinSynMet} with a categorisation
of the different types of synchronic metathesis
that are found in languages of the world.
Aftre this I provide a survey of languages with
synchronic metathesis in \srf{sec:SurLanMet}, focussing on those
of greater Timor -- the region where Meto is spoken.
This is followed by a discussion of the origins of
synchronic metathesis in \srf{sec:OriSynMet}, and
a summary of the forms and functions of synchronic metathesis
in \srf{sec:For ch:SynchMet} and \srf{sec:FunMorMet} respectively.

Probably the most familiar kind of metathesis is historic metathesis
in which a sequence of two sounds has swapped
position at some point in the history of the language.
One case of historic metathesis is found in Dutch
in which rhotic-vowel sequences metathesised
before certain dental consonants \citep[108]{va17}.
An example is Dutch \it{b\tbr{or}st} /b\tbr{ɔr}st/ `breast'
which can be compared with German \it{b\tbr{ru}st} /b\tbr{rʊ}st/
or English \it{b\tbr{rea}st} /b\tbr{rɛ}st/ each of
which preserves the older rhotic-vowel order.

Synchronic metathesis, on the other hand,
is when at least some words in a language
have alternate forms in certain situations
which differ in the order of some of their segments in a regular and systematic way.
Thus, in Rotuman (\srf{sec:Rot}) the word for `flower'
is either \it{ho\tbr{sa}} or \it{ho\tbr{as}} \citep[14]{ch40}.

One phenomenon excluded from my discussion in this chapter
which could be considered metathesis
is that of affixes which have both stem internal and stem external allomorphs.
One example is found in \ili{Ulwa} (Misumalpan, Nicaragua)
in which the \tsc{3sg.gen} affix \it{-ka/\<ka\>}
attaches to the first iambic foot of the stem.\footnote{
		An iambic foot in Ulwa consists of a light syllable followed by a heavy syllable,
		two light syllables, or a single heavy syllable.}
This affix surfaces as a suffix when a word consists of only a single iambic foot
and as an infix when the first iambic foot is followed by other syllables.
Examples are given in \qf{ex2:Ulw3sg} below.

\begin{exe}
	\ex{Ulwa \tsc{3sg.gen} \it{-ka} \hfill(\citealp{habl89} in \citealp{mccpr93})}\label{ex2:Ulw3sg}
	\sn{\gw\begin{tabular}{rlll}

		\it{kiː} 				&\ra& \it{kiː-\tbr{ka}} 					&`stone'\\

		\it{suːlu} 			&\ra& \it{suː\<\tbr{ka}\>lu}			&`dog'\\
		\it{asna} 			&\ra& \it{as\<\tbr{ka}\>na}			 	&`clothes'\\

		\it{karasmak} 	&\ra& \it{karas\<\tbr{ka}\>mak} 	&`knee'\\
		\end{tabular}}
\end{exe}

This chapter provides the typological context for my
description of metathesis in Amarasi.
Because of this, I frequently provide forward references
to later sections of this book in which Amarasi phenomena
similar to those under discussion are provided.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:MorMetCon}
In this chapter I examined synchronic metathesis from
a cross-linguistic perspective.
I identified three kinds of synchronic metathesis:
phonologically conditioned, morphemically conditioned, and morphological.
I surveyed the languages of the greater Timor region
for which synchronic metathesis has been described,
as well as Kwara'ae and Rotuman in the Pacific.

I showed that metathesis often resists a unitary analysis
and that for several languages a single process of metathesis may be phonologically conditioned
in some environments, but morphological in other environments.
Furthermore, when morphological, a single process of metathesis may have multiple functions.
Both these facts hold for Amarasi in which metathesis is
phonologically conditioned in one environment (Chapter \ref{ch:PhoMet})
and has two distinct morphological functions (Chapters \ref{ch:SynMet} and \ref{ch:DisMet}).

In this chapter I have summarised the origins, forms, and functions of synchronic metathesis
and showed that there is no fundamental difference between metathesis
and other morphological processes.
In particular, the development of synchronic metathesis has
several parallels to the development of other non-concatenative
processes such as umlaut in the Germanic languages.
This typological perspective sets the scene for the detailed description
and analysis of Amarasi metathesis which constitutes the rest of this book.
