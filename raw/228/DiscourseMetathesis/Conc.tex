\section{Conclusion}
The different combinations of M\=/forms and discourse U\=/forms
which are found in Amarasi are summarised in \trf{tab:SumUfoMfoCom}.
Metathesis in Amarasi is a morphological
device used to signal whether a situation, event, or communicative act is resolved or not.
U\=/forms are used to signal a lack of resolution,
with more information being required to achieve such resolution.

\trf{tab:SumUfoMfoCom} shows that nearly
all combinations of an M\=/form and a discourse U\=/form
have an M\=/form as the final element.
U\=/forms are canonically resolved by an M\=/form.
This is seen most clearly in tail-head linkage (\srf{sec:TaiHeaLin}),
question-answer pairs (\srf{sec:IntUnm}), and poetic parallelisms (\srf{sec:PoePar}) 
in all of which U\=/forms are obligatorily resolved by M\=/forms.
It is also seen in dependent coordination (\srf{sec:DepCoo}) and chiasmus (\srf{sec:CenChi})
in which U\=/forms are usually resolved by M\=/forms.

A discourse U\=/form entails the presence of a
corresponding M\=/form somewhere in the discourse.
The use of a U\=/form obliges the speaker
or other discourse participants to supply an M\=/form
to complete the discourse structure in which both occur.
At the discourse level, U\=/forms and M\=/forms
comprise a parallel and complementary pair of morphological forms;
they are a dyadic set, with each form being one half of a whole.
The complementary and parallel nature of discourse U\=/forms and M\=/forms
in Amarasi is represented in Figure \ref{fig:AmaDisMet}.
