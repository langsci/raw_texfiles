\section{Preface}
In this appendix I present four Amarasi texts,
three from the Kotos dialect,
which is the focus of this book, and one from Ro{\Q}is.
The Kotos texts include a narrative about a recent event (\S\ref{sec:DeaNahBan}),
a myth about the beginning of the world (\S\ref{sec:MooHit}),
and a conversation (\S\ref{sec:CarCrash}).
The Ro{\Q}is text (\srf{sec:GatBanFam}) is a short life history.

Each sentence/intonation unit is given twice.
The first line is sequentially numbered and gives an orthographic transcription.
The second line is numbered according to its time in the recording.
This line is given in phonemic transcription,
which is followed by the gloss and a free translation.

Glossing follows the same conventions used throughout this book,
with the exception that the third person singular genitive
suffix \ve{-n} is glossed \tsc{3gen} in the Kotos texts
and \tsc{3psr;sg.psm} in the Ro{\Q}is text (\srf{sec:RoqPoss}).

The only instances of metathesis which are indicated in the glosses
are those which have a morphological meaning:
M\=/forms of nouns modified by an attributive modifier (Chapter \ref{ch:SynMet})
and U\=/forms of vowel-final verbs and other word classes
which take discourse-driven U\=/forms (Chapter \ref{ch:DisMet}).
Non-morphological M\=/forms and U\=/forms
can be detected by comparing the phonemic transcription in the top line
with the corresponding underlying forms in the second line.
