\section{Conclusion}
Syntactic metathesis in Amarasi is a morphological process
used to mark the presence of a following attributive modifier.
Syntactic metathesis affects every non-final word below the level of \br{X}.
The final word of \br{X} occurs in the U\=/form,
with every previous word in the M\=/form.
A syntactic M\=/form therefore does not occur in isolation,
but canonically an typically co-occurs with a following U\=/form.
