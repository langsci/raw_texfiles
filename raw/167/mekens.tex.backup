\section{Introduction} 

This short narrative is a fragment of a mythological tale that describes the origin of maize and other crops, such as beans and manioc (yucca), among the Sakurabiat people.
Sakurabiat is pronounced [sa'kɨrabiat]. In the orthographic convention for the language the grapheme \textbf{<u>} represents the hight central vowel \textbf{[ɨ]}.The Sakurabiat are very reduced in number. In the last survey done in 2016, there were only 65 people living in the Rio Mekens Indigenous Land.

The \textit{Kõtkõra asisi} story is told by Mercedes Guaratira Sakyrabiar, one of the oldest speakers of Sakurabiat at the time of the recording. Sadly, she passed away in December of 2015. Mercedes's age was not known for certain, but she was believed to be more than 75 years old when she told this story in 2006. 
The story was recorded in audio as part of a long term project for the documentation and study of the Sakurabiat (Mekens) language, which had partial support from the Endangered Language Documentation Program, funded by the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). 

Transcription and analysis was done by Galucio with the assistance of Rosalina Guaratira Sakyrabiar, Mercedes's daughter, and the two brothers who have been Galucio's main collaborators in the study of the Sakurabiat language: Manoel Ferreira Sakyrabiar, a very talented man and an enthusiast of the study of his language, who was brutally murdered in 2016, and his younger brother Olimpio Ferreira Sakyrabiar. All three are bilingual speakers of Sakurabiat and Portuguese. 

This text is one of the 25 mythological tales, recounted by some of the most distinguished Sakurabiat elders, that appear in the book \textit{Narrativas Tradicionais SAKURABIAT mayãp ebõ} (organized by Galucio 2006). Some of the illustrations used in that book, which were drawn by two Sakurabiat children at the time of publication, Lidia Sakyrabiar and Ozelio Sakyrabiar, are included here.

According to the account given in the narrative, the Sakurabiat were unfamiliar with maize and other edible crops until one day \textit{Arɨkʷajõ} discovered that \textit{Kõtkõra}, a shaman from a neighboring group, had maize. \textit{Arɨkʷajõ} then went to visit that shaman and stole the seeds.

\end{figure}

\textit{Arɨkʷajõ} is the great mythological figure in Sakurabiat traditional stories. He is considered to be the great shaman with vast powers and wisdom. In the mythological narratives, he appears as the creator of many aspects of nature. For instance, he created the mountains and the valleys, and he had water and fire when no one else had them. He is also portrayed as the father of the sun, named \textit{Kiakop} ‘our warmth', and the moon, named \textit{Pakori}, and the one responsible for sending them both away from earth as punishment for inappropriate social behavior. \textit{Kiakop}, the sun, had set his sisters on fire, and \textit{Pakori}, the moon, had tricked his sister into having an incestuous sexual relationship with him. In the present narrative \textit{Arɨkʷajõ} is married to his second wife, \textit{Pãrãrẽkosa}. 

\newpage 
The other main character in the narrative, \textit{Kõtkõra}, which means ‘cicada’, is another mythological shaman, apparently from a distinct ethnic mythological group.  \textit{Kõtkõra}'s group had edible crops that \textit{Arɨkʷajõ}'s people, the Sakurabiat, did not have. 

The fragment of the story analyzed here focuses on how, after noticing that a black-fronted piping guan bird was defecating corn, \textit{Arɨkʷajõ} followed the bird to find out where it was eating corn. When he discovered that it was at \textit{Kõtkõra}'s village, he visited the other shaman's house with the intent to get corn for himself and his family. Thus, despite being well received by \textit{Kõtkõra}, \textit{Arɨkʷajõ} used his special powers to steal the seeds from \textit{Kõtkõra}'s house. After bringing the crops to his village, and starting to make his food from maize and yucca, he changed his children's teeth, adapting them to their new condition of eating crops rather than stones. 
That is, since they no longer had to eat stones and wild seeds, they could have softer teeth, teeth that would fall out, eventually. 
The complete narrative recalls the first meeting of these two shamans and how both ended up having crops to eat. 
After \textit{Arɨkʷajõ} was received in \textit{Kõtkõra}'s house, he took seeds for his village, but did not destroy \textit{Kõtkõra}'s fields. Thus, it is a mythological tale that touches upon relationships of hospitality and rivalry among neighbors.

The language of the Sakurabiat people has been traditionally referred to in the literature as “Mekens". In more recent years, it has also been referred to as Sakurabiat in an attempt to acknowledge the self denomination of the group, and we adopt this name in this work, to refer to the language, one of the five surviving languages of the Tuparian branch of the large Tupian family.

\newpage 
The Tupian family is composed of ten subfamilies \citep{hv:Rodrigues:Tupi-Guarani:Internas}, which include about 40-45 languages that are spread throughout the Amazon \citep{hel:Mooreetal:Amazonicas}.
Alongside Sakurabiat, the other four languages of the Tuparian branch are: Akuntsú, Makurap, Tupari, and Wayoro.
All five languages are spoken in the state of Rondônia, in the northwestern part of Brazil, near the Brazil-Bolivia border, and they are all highly endangered due to the greatly reduced number of speakers. 
According to information collected in 2016, from Galucio's  field work and from colleagues working with these specific languages, Tupari has about 300 speakers, Makurap has about 55-60 speakers, Akuntsú only 4, and Wayoro just 3 speakers. Sakurabiat has about 16 speakers, and they are all adults. 

\begin{figure}

  \caption{The Rio Mekens Indigenous Land, where the Sakurabiat live in the Brazilian state of Rondônia, is shown in yellow.}
  \label{fig:mekens:map}
\end{figure}

It is noteworthy that the current state of Rondônia houses representatives of six of the ten Tupian subfamilies, including five that are spoken exclusively there: Arikém, Puruborá, Mondé, Ramarama, and Tupari. The other five subfamilies are Juruna, Munduruku, Mawé, Aweti, and Tupi-Guarani, which is the largest and most widespread of the Tupian subfamilies.

Sakurabiat is a typical Tupian language. It is a primarily suffixing language, but it also has a few prefixes, such as the  pronominal person markers and valence changing morphemes (causative and intransitivizer). The language shows a head-marking profile, with locus of morphosyntactic marking on the head of the phrase. In clauses, the syntactic functions of subject and object are marked on the verb rather than on the nominal arguments. In simple transitive clauses with nominal arguments, both noun phrases tend to precede the verb, following basic SOV order. 
There are three types of lexical verbs: intransitive, transitive, and uninflectible or particle verbs. Transitive and intransitive verbs take person agreement and TAM inflectional markers. Only one argument is indexed on the verb by means of person prefixes. The intransitive verb indexes the subject and the transitive verb indexes the object.
The particle verbs do not inflect in that way. In order to take person and TAM inflection, they undergo derivation via the verb formatives (\textit{-ka}, \textit{-kwa}, \textit{e-}), which give as output transitive or intransitive verb stems. 

Based on the distribution of the person markers, the morphosyntactic alignment can be described as nominative-absolutive in simple main clauses, as proposed for some Cariban and Northern Jê languages by Gildea and Castro Alves (2010). The set of prefixes marks the absolutive argument (S/P), while the set of free pronouns expresses the nominative (A/S).
In the case of transitive verbs, pronominal subjects obligatorily occur as free pronouns, except for third person, which can be left unmarked. With intransitive verbs, on the other hand, free pronouns are optionally used, co-occurring  with the subject verb agreement markers. For its part, the O argument is never expressed by a free pronoun. For an overall description of Sakurabiat verb agreement and argument structure, see \citet{Galucio2014}.

\largerpage
Auxiliaries also show person agreement and TAM inflections. Person indexation on auxiliaries follows a nominative pattern, always indexing the clause subject (A or S).
Auxiliaries and demonstratives are positional roots that indicate the body posture of the subject, in the case of auxiliaries, and of the referent, in the case of demonstratives. 
In addition to the positional demonstratives, there is a series of discourse anaphoric demonstratives or proforms that are used to replace a syntactic unit: they can replace a syntactic phrase, an entire clause, or even larger stretches of discourse. 

Nominalization is the main strategy used to form adverbial (temporal, conditional, causal, and final) clauses in Sakurabiat \citep{Galucio2011}. The adverbial modification is encoded by a nominalized verb form (with the nominalizer \textit{-ap} ‘instrumental; circumstantial’) or one of the demonstrative proforms followed by a postposition. The ablative postposition \textit{eri} is used for causal clauses, and the locative postposition \textit{ese} for temporal/conditional and also some causal clauses. 

Three dialects have been identified for Sakurabiat: Guaratira, which is the one spoken by the narrator of this story, Siokweriat, and Sakurabiat/Guarategayat. The major differences among them are phonological and lexical.

The \textit{Kõtkõra asisi} story is transcribed phonetically in the first line, and segmented phonologically and  morphologically in the second line. There is nasal harmony inside the word in Sakurabiat. 
Nasality spreads rightwards from a nasal consonant or vowel, and is blocked only by an obstruent in onset position.
Thus, in the second line, only the underlying nasal element is indicated as being nasal.
The third line gives a morpheme-by-morpheme gloss. English and Portuguese free translations are given in the fourth and fifth lines. The Portuguese translation attempts to maintain in as much as possible the structure of the original Sakurabiat narrative.
