\section{Introduction}

The story of the Smooth-billed Ani (a type of bird in the cuckoo family\footnote{The smooth-billed ani (\textit{Crotophaga ani}) is a breeding species that lives in several regions across the Americas. It is a black bird, known in Portuguese as \textit{anu} or \textit{anu preto}.}) is a myth told by the Trumai people of the central region of Brazil. It was video recorded in 2000 by the author (Raquel Guirardello-Damian) and narrated by Kumaru Trumai, a middle-aged woman who has since died. She learned it from her father, Ɨnɨtɨarɨ, a great and respected storyteller. The myth was later transcribed and analyzed with the assistance of a young man, Tarukuy, who is bilingual in Trumai and Portuguese. The text is presented in its phonological form with IPA symbols, followed by English glosses and free translation. When necessary, comments are added in the footnotes.



\section{The Trumai people and their language}
The Trumai live in the “Xingu Indigenous Land", at the northern edge of the Upper Xingu area. The group originally came from another land, located to the southeast of the Upper Xingu \citep{MurphyQuain1955}, and it is assumed that they moved to the Xingu region in the first half of the 19th century due to attacks by another tribe, possibly the Xavante \citep{VillasBoas1970}. Their initial contacts with the local groups were not peaceful and led to some conflicts. When \citet{Steinen1940} visited the region, in the second half of the 19th century, the Trumai still did not have good relations with the Upper Xinguan tribes, but eventually became integrated to the new environment.

The Upper Xingu is a multilingual and multi-ethnic regional system. Several groups live in the area, having different languages and historical backgrounds. However, they also share many common cultural features, observed especially in the activities of daily survival, diet, mythology, and inter/intra village rituals \citep{GalvãoSimões1966}. Such cultural homogeneity was developed through the interaction of various factors, such as the isolation of the region, physical proximity of the groups, commerce and intertribal marriages, and groups' influence on each other. The Trumai people are the least integrated into this system. Although they share several of the Upper Xingu cultural practices, they also keep some of their own original traditions – for example,  they do not take part in the \textit{Kwarup} ceremony, an important intertribal ritual, and they eat certain kinds of animals that are forbidden to other Upper Xinguan groups \citep{Monod-Becquelin1975,Monod-Becquelin,Guirardello2001}.

The location of the Trumai villages in the Xingu reserve changed several times after their arrival in the area. Nowadays, their population is concentrated mainly in three villages: \textit{Boa Esperança}, \textit{Três Lagoas} (with inhabitants from the former village known as \textit{Terra Preta}), and \textit{Steinen}. There are also families living in cities close to the reserve. The community has more than 100 individuals, but the number of Trumai speakers is reduced, being approximately 50. Levels of proficiency vary among individuals, with the older speakers exhibiting broader and deeper linguistic knowledge. Children do not learn the language anymore, speaking Portuguese (the national language of Brazil) or another Xinguan language instead. Various historical factors contributed to its endangerment (cf. Guirardello 1999, preface).

With regard to genetic linguistic affiliations, Trumai is considered an isolate language \citep{Rodrigues1986,Kaufman1994}. In relation to the Xingu area, Trumai seems to have a unique status, not only in terms of genetic affiliation, but also with regard to typological features. For instance, it has ejective stops, sounds not observed in the other languages of the region \citep{Seki2000,Fargetti1992,Dourado 2001,Emmerich1980}. It also employs positional verbs in locative and existential constructions, another fact not attested in other Xinguan languages \citep{Guirardello2007}. It also has three dative markers, a quite interesting typological characteristic.

Trumai has four open classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) and little inflectional morphology, i.e., words usually consist of a single morpheme. For nouns, there are two important subdivisions: 
(i) alienably possessed versus inalienably possessed nouns, with a further subdivision between body parts and kinship terms;  
(ii) animate versus inanimate nouns. These distinctions are observed in various points of the grammar. Trumai has five verbal classes and the case system exhibits an ergative-absolutive alignment, manifested through markers on NPs or the use of postpositions. There are also ergative alignments in syntax \citep{Guirardello-Damian2010}. The basic word order is SOV, but variations of order are possible depending on pragmatic factors; the variations observed in negative clauses are particularly noteworthy \citep{Guirardello1999}.

With regard to the phonological system, Trumai has six vowels (/i/, /e/, /ɨ/, /a/, /u/, /o/) and twenty three consonants (/p/, /t̪ /, /t/, /d/, /k/, /ʔ/, /t̪'/, /t'/, /k'/, /ts/, /ts'/, /f/, /s/, /ʃ/, /x/, /h/, /m/, /n/, /l/, /ɬ/, /ɾ/, /w/, /j/). The vowels /e/ and /o/ have two allophones in free variation: [e] and [ɛ], [o]  and [ɔ] respectively (cf. \citealt{Guirardello1999}: 1--6).



\section{The topic of the narrative} 
The narrative presented here is related to issues of life and death. It explains the origins of the chanted cries and lamentations that the Trumai people perform when mourning somebody's death. The story happens in mythological times, when animals were like human beings, having their own villages, conducting daily survival activities, and being able to speak. Thus, the main character in the story, the Smooth-billed Ani, has anthropomorphic features. One day he decides to play a trick on his grandmother. While she is in the fields collecting firewood, he stages a big scene in her house, pretending that she has died. He then performs some actions and crying, showing that he is sad for her death. The crying was later imitated by others and became part of the Upper Xinguan traditions for expressing sorrow.\footnote{In a section about Trumai mythology, Murphy and \citet[73]{Quain1955} apparently make a brief mention of this myth – although they refer to the smooth-billed ani as “crow", another black bird: “crow appeared as a trickster and, although not a creator deity, managed to bring forth new things in the process of his machinations.” }

Trumai funeral practices were first documented by the ethnologist Buell Quain, who lived among them in 1938, although his description is brief. Further research conducted by the anthropologist Emmanuel de Vienne obtained many more details and revealed that the practices can be quite elaborate. The next paragraphs give an overview of the information provided by \citet{MurphyQuain1955} and De Vienne (personal communication).

In the Trumai funerary ceremony, the classic division is between the ones who dig the hole for the grave (\textit{owowas xot̪kenke wan} ‘the hole diggers') and those who perform the crying (\textit{watkanke wan} ‘the ones who cry'). Ritual cries and lamentations begin from the moment of death. Close relatives cry by repeating the kinship term that bound them to the deceased person. The other relatives use the same formula, but also provide consolation to the close relatives by saying stereotyped expressions (e.g. “This is how it is, we cannot do anything"; “It is like this for us, humans"; “You have to be strong, because it happens to everyone"). The crying follows a particular melody and consists of the repetition of the vocative used to call the dead person (for example: \textit{atseda} ‘grandma', \textit{ajej} ‘grandpa', \textit{atsiwe} ‘mum', etc.). This vocative can be combined with expressions that convey compassion and sadness. In the myth below, we will see a concrete example of this.\footnote{The tradition of executing ritual cries is also part of the death ceremonies of other Upper Xinguan tribes. For example, \citet[441]{GuerreiroJúnior2012} describes the crying used in the funerary rituals of the Kalapalo people, which exhibits the same pattern as the Trumai one.}

The ritual crying happens before and at the moment of burying the body. There is also the practice of “welcome in tears", which is a crying performed when relatives living far away arrive for the first time after the death, even several months later. The visitors start to cry loudly on their way to the village. The close relatives of the deceased person then come to welcome them in the central square of the village and they go together to the grave in order to cry. There are further ritual cries in secondary funerary rituals, such as the Javari festivity.

Burial takes place in the central area of the village, which has a circular shape. On the day of death, or the next day (if it is necessary to wait for the arrival of relatives), three or four men who are distant relatives from the deceased ask permission to dig the grave. These man must not have children under the age of two, otherwise the spirit of the deceased person may bring diseases to the child. They proceed as the crying and lamentations continue. First, they measure the body with a bamboo in order to determine the size of the grave, which is prepared in the shape of a hole. The bottom widens to form a tunnel where the corpse will be placed. Chiefs, both male and female, are given a special burial treatment, since their grave has a tunnel with two exits. Special funerary treatments for chiefs are observed in other Upper Xingu groups as well, such as the Kuikuro \citep{Heckenberger2003}. 

After finishing their job, the diggers return to the dead person's house and start the ceremonial crying, then announce that it is time to bury the body, which is painted and adorned with feathers by a distant relative. They wrap and tie a hammock around the body, starting with the feet. The face is protected by a fiber mat (\textit{tuwawi}) to prevent it from coming into contact with the soil/earth. Personal objects are placed inside the hammock: cooking utensils for women, bows and arrows for men. The remaining possessions are broken and burned or used to “pay" visitors and diggers. Guided by a close relative, the diggers carry the body through the front door, walk around the house several times, and enter through the back door. They do the same action inside, before going to the grave. During this time, cries and demonstrations of deep sadness continue.

The corpse is “interred lying on its back in an extended position" \citep[90]{MurphyQuain1955}.\footnote{According to another text recorded with a Trumai speaker, chiefs would be buried in a different way: male chiefs (\textit{aek}) would be buried in a standing position, while female chiefs (\textit{aek pekts'a}) would be buried in a seated position. However, this information was not confirmed by De Vienne's consultants, thus it is not clear if it refers to a practice currently followed by the Trumai or to some older tradition.} The feet are placed towards the east, so that the soul of the deceased person faces the direction it should go. A shaman performs a ritual prayer in order to prevent it from coming back. This prayer is performed in the grave and all the places where the deceased person used to go (house, garden plot, etc.). The following day, the diggers go fishing and take the fish to the deceased person's house. A close relative takes them to the grave, where a shaman performs a prayer and blows tobacco smoke on the fish. This food is meant for spirits, which are expected to be present in large numbers around the grave. After this, the fish are shared and distributed to the whole village. A fire is placed on the grave for the next three or four days, the time necessary for the deceased person's soul to go away to the village of the dead.

\section{General aspects of the narrative}  
Some of the procedures of the Trumai funerary practices – the ritual crying, the breaking and burning of the deceased's possessions, the wrapping of the body in a hammock – are observed in the narrative presented in the next section. As already mentioned, there are two central characters, the Smooth-billed Ani and his grandmother, with a third character appearing just briefly (his aunt). Events happen in chronological order, with one pause made by the narrator to make a comment about the Upper Xingu death rituals (lines 34-37).

With regard to the linguistic characteristics of the narrative, a visible feature is the use of kinship terms (\textit{aɬahne} ‘grandmother', \textit{mako} ‘aunt (mother's sister)', \textit{doxo} ‘grandchild') with their possessive marker (\textit{tsi-} ‘3\textsc{poss}'). The text also employs motion verbs and directional auxiliaries, such as \textit{lahmi} ‘go uphill'. The occurrence of \textit{k(e)tsi} is particularly interesting. In daily conversations, this auxiliary is employed to describe motion towards the place where the speaker is, often generating the sense of ‘come' or ‘bring' \citep{Guirardello-Damian2012}, but in the case of this narrative, \textit{k(e)tsi} is employed when somebody moves towards the place where the main character and key actions are (lines 29-31) – in other words, this auxiliary can also be used for a place that is the focus of the attention of the speaker and listener.

The text has various instances of hearsay particles and ideophones, which is not surprising, since they are often found in narratives. It is worth mentioning that some Trumai ideophones are similar in shape to the ones in Kamayurá, another Xinguan language \citep{Guirardello-Damian2014}. This is the case of the ideophone for “walking" observed in the text (cf. \fnref{fn:trumai:21}). 

There are occurrences of direct speech in the narrative, but they do not configure dialogues properly speaking. The main character (Smooth-billed Ani) does not talk to anyone in particular; rather, he  talks in order to be heard by people in the village. The other character (his grandmother) talks to herself, wondering what is happening in her house. In her speech (lines 40 and 45), we find the particle \textit{apa}, which indicates uncertainty by the speaker and can be broadly translated as ‘I wonder'. The aunt is the only character who talks to a specific addressee, and in her speech we can see the 2nd person pronoun (\textit{hi} ‘you') or the 1st person inclusive (\textit{ka a} ‘we two (inclusive)', which contrasts with \textit{ha a} ‘we two (exclusive)', \textit{ka wan} ‘we – more than two (inclusive)' and \textit{ha wan} ‘we – more than two (exclusive)').

As a final note, it is interesting to mention that all verbal classes are represented in the text, since it contains several action verbs. For example:  \textbf{class 1 (intransitives):} \textit{kaʔʃɨ}  ‘walk'; \textbf{class 2 (transitives):} \textit{husa} ‘tie', \textit{tsisi} ‘burn'; \textit{kiwa} ‘abandon'; \textbf{class 3 (ditransitives):} \textit{tsitsu} ‘put'; \textbf{class 4 (intransitives with two positions):} \textit{kuʔku} ‘break', \textit{huʔtsa} ‘see', \textit{faʔtsa} ‘hear'; \textbf{class 5 (verbs with varied transitivity):}  \textit{naha} ‘cut/break' (for more information about the verbal classes, cf. \citealt{Guirardello-Damian2010}). The text also includes the verbs for crying: \textit{watkan} ‘to weep' (i.e. to shed tears when one is sad) and \textit{ora} ‘to cry intensely, screaming' (as small children do when they fall. This term can also be used for the cries of certain animals, such as monkeys). In the narrative, the occurrence of \textit{ora} is much higher than \textit{watkan}, which makes sense, since the main character is trying to get attention and provoke a commotion as part of his trick, thus his crying needs to be intense.

\footnotetext{Two comments with regard to this sentence: 
(i) \textit{inis} occurs in the first position of a clause and is often followed by the adverb \textit{hen} ‘then'.  It can be analyzed internally as a combination of two morphemes (the demonstrative pronoun \textit{in} plus the temporal marker \textit{-is}, which would be literally translated as ‘in this situation/event'), but its main role is as a discourse connector, with the sense of ‘and then'. Sometimes \textit{inis} can be replaced by \textit{ina}, another possible connector; 
(ii) The adjective \textit{de} indicates pity for the person being mentioned. The speaker talks in a touching and tender way.}

This morpheme has a unique nature and its function is not not entirely clear, but it seems to be linked to pragmatic information. It presents two forms: \textit{ji}, which occurs in NPs containing an element (i.e., a noun, pronoun or pluralizer), and \textit{iji}, which can occur by itself in a NP (but only Absolutive NPs). We could analyze \textit{iji} as a pronominal form (i.e., a dummy pronoun) and \textit{ji} as some sort of modifier, however this analysis has its own limitations (cf. \citealt{Guirardello-Damian2005}: 281-285). For the present text, I will use ‘\textsc{prag.in}' as the gloss for this morpheme.}

\footnotetext{The morpheme \textit{t̪'axer} is usually employed with the sense of `poor' or `misfortuned', but it can also be used with an offensive tone (wretched, bastard). When used as an adverb, it has a sense of `poorly' or `in a modest way'.
The pattern that we see in the sentence above is attested in other examples involving this morpheme: it can occur after a noun (as in \REF{exfn:trumai:1} below), or it can occur without the noun if the verb receives the 3rd person enclitic \textit{=n/=e} (as in \REF{exfn:trumai:2}).\\

\z

It might be that \textit{t̪'axer} is not a modifier, but rather a noun with the sense of `misfortune, wretched condition' and the noun that comes before it would be its possessor (something like: the wretched condition of the dog = the wretched dog). In the case of example \REF{exfn:trumai:2}, \textit{t̪'axer} would be incorporated into the verb, a pattern attested in the language, as in example \REF{exfn:trumai:3b} below:\\

\ea
\eafirst\label{exfn:trumai:3a}

\glt `I pulled his shirt (lit: I shirt-pulled him).'\\
\z
\z



It is possible to propose such an analysis given that other languages exhibit constructions similar to this one. For instance, in Portuguese one can say [\textit{cachorro desgraçado}] or [\textit{a desgraça do cachorro}] with the sense of `wretched dog'. The literal translation of [\textit{a desgraça do cachorro}] is `the misfortune of the dog'. Thus, it might be that Trumai has a similar pattern.}
