\title{Anatolian Arabic}

\author{Faruk Akkuş\affiliation{University of Pennsylvania}}

\abstract{This chapter investigates contact-induced changes in Anatolian Arabic varieties. The study first gives an overview of the current state and historical development of Anatolian Arabic. This is followed by a survey of changes Anatolian Arabic varieties have undergone as a result of language contact with primarily Turkish and Kurdish. The chapter demonstrates that the extent of the change varies from one dialect to another, and that this closely correlates with the degree of contact a dialect has had with the surrounding languages.}

\section{Current state and historical development}

Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is part of the so-called \textit{qəltu}-dialect branch of the larger \ili{Mesopotamian} \ili{Arabic}, and essentially refers to the \ili{Arabic} dialects spoken in eastern Turkey.\footnote{This group represents an older linguistic stratum of Mesopotamia as compared to the \textit{gələt} dialects. The terms \textit{qəltu} vs. \textit{gələt} dialects are due to \cite{Blanc1964}, who distinguished between the \ili{Arabic} dialects spoken by three religious communities,
Muslim, Jewish, and Christian, in \ili{Baghdad}. He classified the Jewish and
Christian dialects as \textit{qəltu} dialects and the Muslim dialect as a \textit{gələt} dialect, on the basis of their respective reflexes of \ili{Classical} \ili{Arabic} \textit{qultu} `I said'.} In three provinces of Turkey -- Hatay, Mersin and Adana -- \ili{Syrian} sedentary \ili{Arabic} is spoken (see Proch\'{a}zka, this volume, for discussion of these dialects).\ia{Procházka, Stephan@Procházka, Stephan} Other than these dialects, in Jastrow's (\citeyear{Jastrow1978}) classification of \ili{Mesopotamian} \textit{qəltu} dialects, Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects are subdivided into five groups:
\ili{Diyarbakır} dialects (spoken by a Jewish and Christian minority, now almost extinct); \ili{Mardin} dialects; \ili{Siirt} dialects; \ili{Kozluk} dialects; and \ili{Sason} dialects.
In his later work, \citet{Jastrow2011anatolian} classifies \ili{Kozluk} and \ili{Sason} dialects under one group along with \ili{Muş} dialects -- investigated primarily by Talay (\citeyear{Talay2001,Talay2002}). The two larger cities where \ili{Arabic} is spoken are \ili{Mardin} and \ili{Siirt}, although in the latter \ili{Arabic} is gradually being replaced by \ili{Turkish}.

The linguistic differences between these various \ili{Arabic}-speaking groups are quite considerable. Thus, given the low degree of mutual intelligibility, speakers of different varieties resort to the official language, \ili{Turkish}, to communicate. \citet{Jastrow2006} reports an anecdote, wherein high school students from \ili{Mardin} and \ili{Siirt} converse in \ili{Turkish}, since they find it difficult to understand each other's dialects. Expectedly, mutual intelligibility is at a considerably higher level among different varieties of a single group, despite certain differences. For instance,  speakers of \ili{Kozluk} and \ili{Muş} \ili{Arabic} have no difficulty in communicating with one another in \ili{Arabic}.

The existence of Anatolian dialects closely relates to the question of the Arabicization of the greater \ili{Mesopotamian} area. Although the details largely remain obscure, a commonly-held view is that it took place in two stages: the first stage concerns the emergence of urban varieties of \ili{Arabic} around the military centers, such as Ba\d{s}ra or K\={u}fa, during the early Arab conquests. Later, the migration of \ili{Bedouin} dialects of tribes added another layer to the urban dialects (see e.g. \citealt{Blanc1964,Versteegh1997,Jastrow2006} for discussion). According to \cite{Blanc1964}, the \textit{qəltu} dialects are a continuation of the medieval vernaculars that were spoken in the sedentary centers of Abbasid Iraq. \cite{Blanc1964} also noted that the \textit{qəltu} dialects did not stop at the {Iraqi}--{Turkish} border, but in fact continued into Turkish territory. He mentioned the towns of \ili{Mardin} and \ili{Siirt} as places where \textit{qəltu} dialects were still spoken.

Despite being a continuation of \ili{Mesopotamian} dialects, Anatolian dialects of \ili{Arabic} have been cut off from the mainstream of \ili{Arabic} dialects. How exactly this cut-off and separation between dialects happened, given the lack of specific barriers, is largely unknown and remains at a speculative level. Regarding this topic, Proch\'{a}zka (this volume)\ia{Procházka, Stephan@Procházka, Stephan} suggests ``the foundation of nation states after World War One entailed significant decrease in contact between the different dialect groups and an almost complete isolation of the \ili{Arabic} dialects spoken in Turkey''.

Like \ili{Central Asian} \ili{Arabic} and \ili{Cypriot Maronite} Arabic (Walter, this volume),\ia{Walter, Mary Ann@Walter, Mary Ann} Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects are characterized by: (i) separation from the \ili{Arabic}-speaking world; (ii) contact with regional languages, which has affected them strongly; and (iii) multilingualism of speakers. %These properties extend to

The Anatolian dialects have diverged much more from the Standard type of \ili{Arabic} compared to the other \textit{qəltu} dialects, such as the Tigris or Euphrates groups (\citealt{Jastrow2011iraq}). One of the hallmarks of Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is the suffix \textit{-n} instead of \textit{-m} in the second and third person plural (e.g. in \ili{Mardin} \ili{Arabic} \textit{baytkən} `your (\textsc{pl}) house', \textit{baytən} `their house') and the {negation} \textit{m\={o}} with the imperfect. In addition to many interesting properties like the ones just mentioned, Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has acquired a large number of interesting contact-induced patterns.

These dialects are spoken as minority languages by speakers belonging to different ethnic or religious groups. As noted by \cite{Jastrow2006}, not all of the Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties are spoken \textit{in situ} however, and in fact some may no longer be spoken at all. Jastrow notes that some of the dialects were exclusively spoken by {Christians} and almost died out during World War One as a result of the massacres of the Armenians and other Christian groups. A few thousand speakers of these dialects survive to this day, most of whom have migrated to big cities, starting from the mid-1980s, particularly Istanbul. Some speakers of these dialects also live in Europe. Nevertheless, these dialects are very likely to face extinction in a few decades.

The {Jews} who spoke Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties (mainly in Diyarbak{\i}r, but also in Urfa and Siverek; cf. \citealt{Nevo1999}) migrated to Israel after the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948. These dialects also face a serious threat of extinction.

Today Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects are predominantly spoken by {Muslims} (although there are a few hundred \ili{Arabic}-speaking {Christians}, particularly in some parts of Istanbul, such as Samatya). These dialects are still found \textit{in situ}, however they are also subject to constant linguistic pressure from \ili{Turkish} (the official language) and \ili{Kurdish} (the dominant regional \ili{Indo-Iranian} language), and social pressure to assimilate. The quote from Grigore (\citeyear[27]{Grigore2007book}) summarizes the overall context of Anatolian \ili{Arabic}: ``il se situe dans un microcontexte kurde, situé à son tour dans un macrocontexte turc, étant isolé de la sorte de la grande masse des dialectes arabes contemporains.''\footnote{``It is situated in a \ili{Kurdish} microcontext, which is in turn situated in a \ili{Turkish} macrocontext, thus being isolated from the vast majority of contemporary \ili{Arabic} dialects''.}


The total number of speakers is around 620,000 (\citealt[162]{Procházka2018Anatolian}), most of whom are bi- or trilingual in
\ili{Arabic}, \ili{Kurdish} and \ili{Turkish}. As Jastrow (\citeyear[88]{Jastrow2011anatolian}) points out, the phenomenon of {diglossia} is not observed in {Anatolia}; instead \ili{Turkish} occupies the position of the `High variety', and
Anatolian \ili{Arabic}, the `Low variety', occupies a purely dialectal position. In addition, speakers of
different dialects may speak other minority languages as well. For instance, a considerable number of \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} speakers know the local variety of the \ili{Iranian} language \ili{Zazaki}, and those of \ili{Armenian} origin speak an \ili{Armenian} dialect.


Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties are in decline among the speakers of these varieties, and public life is dominated primarily by \ili{Turkish} (and \ili{Kurdish}). The presence of \ili{Arabic} in Turkey has increased due to Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey, yet this increased presence primarily concerns \ili{Syrian} \ili{Arabic}, rather than Anatolian \ili{Arabic} (see Proch\'{a}zka, this volume).\ia{Procházka, Stephan@Procházka, Stephan} In addition to the absence of awareness about Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects in the Arab states, the Anatolian dialects also suffer from a more general lack of interest. The speakers generally do not attribute any {prestige} to their languages, calling it ``broken \ili{Arabic}'', and often making little effort to pass it on to the next generations. It should, however, be noted that there has been increasing interest in these dialects in recent years, especially at the academic level. To this end, several workshops have been organized at universities in the relevant regions, aimed at promoting these dialects and discussing possible strategies for their preservation.

The data referenced in this chapter come from various Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects. The name of each variety and its source(s) are as follows: \ili{Āzəḫ} \citep{Wittrich2001}; \ili{Daragözü} \citep{Jastrow1973}; \ili{Ḥapəs} \citep{Talay2007}; \ili{Hasköy} \citep{Talay2001,Talay2002}; \ili{Kinderib} \citep{Jastrow1978};  \ili{Mardin}  \citep{Jastrow2006,Grigore2007article,GrigoreBituna2012}; \ili{Mutki-Sason} \citep{Akkus2016,Akkus2017,Isaksson2005}; \ili{Siirt} \citep{Bituna2016,GrigoreBituna2012}; \ili{Tillo} \citep{Lahdo2009}.

\section{Contact languages}

\subsection{Overview}
{Anatolia}, especially the (south)eastern part, has been home to many distinct linguistic groups (as well as ethnic and religious groups). Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, speakers of the largest Anatolian languages -- \ili{Kurdish}, \ili{Zazaki}, \ili{Armenian}, \ili{Aramaic} and \ili{Arabic} -- had been co-existing for almost a thousand years. This has naturally resulted in extensive contact among these languages.

Contact influence on Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has arisen mainly through long-term bi- and multi-lingualism rather than through {language shift} (in which speakers of other languages shifted to \ili{Arabic}; \citealt{Thomason2001}).\footnote{But note also the case of the Mhallamiye near Midyat, who most likely were \ili{Aramaic} speakers and shifted to \ili{Arabic} after adopting Islam as their religion (thanks to Stephan Procházka for bringing this to my attention).} As a result, when applicable, the changes seem to be primarily through borrowing, rather than {imposition} (in the sense of \citealt{VanCoetsem1988,VanCoetsem2000}).


\subsection{Turkish}\largerpage[2]
\ili{Turkish}, as the official language of Turkey, currently dominates public life in most \ili{Arabic}-speaking areas. However, as noted by Haig (\citeyear[14]{Haig2014}), ``the current omnipresent influence of \ili{Turkish} in the region is in fact a relatively recent phenomenon,
fueled by compulsory \ili{Turkish}-language state education, the mass-media, and large-scale military operations carried out by the Turkish army in the conflict against militant \ili{Kurdish} groups. But prior to the twentieth century, the influence of \ili{Turkish} in many parts of rural east {Anatolia} was negligible.''

Although \ili{Turkish} is the dominant language in the public sphere, there are still many people, particularly in rural parts of (south-)eastern Turkey, who do not speak \ili{Turkish}, including speakers of Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties. It is usually women over forty years old that fall into this category. They tend to speak the local \ili{Arabic} variety along with the dominant language in that geographic area.


Moreover, the amount of \ili{Turkish} influence is greater on the \ili{Arabic} speakers who have migrated to bigger cities such as Istanbul, compared to those who still speak their dialects \textit{in situ}.

\subsection{Kurdish and Zazaki}
Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has been in {intensive} contact with two Western \ili{Iranian} languages: \ili{Kurmanji} \ili{Kurdish} and \ili{Zazaki}. These languages have influenced each other on different levels. As noted by Proch\'{a}zka (this volume)\ia{Procházka, Stephan@Procházka, Stephan} and Öpengin (this volume), \ili{Kurdish} and \ili{Arabic}, including the region of south-eastern {Anatolia}, have experienced extensive contact since at least the tenth century.\ia{Öpengin, Ergin@Öpengin, Ergin}


Due to the multi-ethnic (and to a lesser extent multi-religious) nature of the regions, {bilingualism} between \ili{Arabic} and \ili{Kurdish} (or \ili{Zazaki}) is very widespread. The speakers of the non-dominant languages tend to have a stronger command of the dominant languages than the reverse situation. For instance, in Mutki, Bitlis province, where \ili{Kurdish} is the dominant regional language, \ili{Arabic} speakers have a native-like command of \ili{Kurdish}, whereas not many \ili{Kurdish} speakers speak the local \ili{Arabic} variety. In some parts of Sason, Batman province, on the other hand, \ili{Arabic} is the dominant language, and \ili{Kurdish} speakers learn \ili{Arabic} as a second language.

\subsection{Aramaic}
\ili{Aramaic} and \ili{Arabic} have for centuries lived side by side, so that it is possible to speak of both substrates (from \ili{Syriac}/\ili{Neo-Aramaic} to \ili{Arabic}), and of adstrates, or rather, of superstrates (from \ili{Arabic} to \ili{Aramaic}). In the context of Anatolian \ili{Arabic}, \ili{Aramaic} has been in contact mainly with the \ili{Mardin} dialect group.


These two languages have influenced each other in many ways. For instance, the many dialects constituting Modern \ili{Eastern Aramaic} show considerable diversity as to choice of verbal particles. Some dialects use particles similar in form and function to those of the \textit{qəltu}-dialects (see e.g. \citealt{Jastrow1985}; as well as Coghill, this volume, for \ili{North-Eastern Neo-Aramaic} dialects).\ia{Coghill, Eleanor@Coghill, Eleanor}

Finally, it is worth mentioning that, given the existence of \ili{Arabic} speakers of \ili{Armenian} origin, \ili{Armenian} might have influenced certain Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties. However, the influence of \ili{Armenian} is hardly known, apart from the fact that many villages in the further eastern part of {Anatolia}, in which \ili{Arabic} was spoken or is still spoken, bear \ili{Armenian} names. This requires further investigation in its own right.

\section{Contact-induced changes in Anatolian Arabic}

Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects manifest considerable variation, and have also come to exhibit interesting patterns due to language contact in every linguistic aspect. This section surveys these changes and features in turn.

\subsection{Phonology}

Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has undergone significant changes in its consonant and vowel inventories due to language contact (as well as language internal developments). These changes include the introduction of new consonantal phonemes, loss or weakening of {emphatic consonants}, and introduction of new vowels. In addition to these changes, it is possible to count word-final {devoicing} as a contact-induced change.

This section first introduces the consonant inventory in varieties of Anatolian \ili{Arabic}. It should be noted that not all consonants are present in every variety, but the chart serves as the sum of consonants available across Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties. For instance, the phonology of \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} (and other varieties of the \ili{Kozluk–Sason–Muş} group) is characterized by the (near) absence of {pharyngeal} and {emphatic} ({pharyngealized}) consonants,\footnote{These sounds, whose {emphatic} quality is indicated in Table \ref{tab:1:consonants} and throughout with a subscript dot are only nearly absent for two reasons: (i) it is possible to detect them in the speech of elderly speakers in some lexical items, while the younger generations have lost them, (ii) \cite{Talay2001} reports their availability in \ili{Hasköy}, Muş province to a certain extent.} which have fused with their plain counterparts, e.g. \textit{pasal} `onions' in
\ili{Sason} < \ili{Old Arabic} (\ili{OA}) \textit{baṣal}.\footnote{Compare \ili{Cypriot Maronite} \ili{Arabic} (Walter, this volume), \ili{Maltese} (Lucas \& Čéplö, this volume) and \ili{Nigerian} \ili{Arabic} (Owens, this volume).}\ia{Walter, Mary Ann@Walter, Mary Ann}\ia{Lucas, Christopher@Lucas, Christopher}\ia{Čéplö, Slavomír@Čéplö, Slavomír}\ia{Owens, Jonathan@Owens, Jonathan}

\caption{Inventory of consonants. Marginal or doubtful phonemes within parentheses}
\label{tab:1:consonants}
\end{table}


Table \ref{tab:1:consonants}, with information largely taken from \cite{Jastrow2011anatolian}, demonstrates that Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has several consonants that were originally alien to \ili{Arabic} (see §\ref{newsounds} for discussion). With respect to the inventory of vowels, the noteworthy development is the introduction of /\={e}/ and /\={o}/ for some lexical items. Note that the \ili{Old} \ili{Arabic} {diphthongs} *ay and *aw have largely been preserved in these varieties: Jastrow (\citeyear[89]{Jastrow2011anatolian}) notes that one of the processes by means of which these mid long vowels entered the inventory of Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is via {loanwords} from \ili{Turkish} and \ili{Kurdish}, e.g. commonly used items, \textit{\v{c}\={o}l} `desert', \textit{t\={e}l} `wire' (\ili{Turkish}, probably through the intermediary of \ili{Kurdish}), \textit{ḫ\={o}rt} `young man' (\ili{Kurdish}).


\subsubsection{New phonemes /p, \v{c}, ž, g, v/}\label{newsounds}
The Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties, as well as the varieties in (northern) Syria and Iraq, have certain phonemes that were not originally familiar to these varieties of \ili{Arabic}. These phonemes include the voiceless bilabial stop /p/, the voiceless affricate /\v{c}/, the voiced post-alveolar fricative /ž/,\footnote{Cf. \cite{Jastrow2011anatolian} and \cite{GrigoreBituna2012} regarding the status of /ž/: this sound is largely restricted to borrowed words. The reflex of \ili{Arabic} 〈{\arabscript{ج}}〉 in Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is /\v{g}/.} the voiced velar stop /g/, and the voiced labiodental fricative /v/.\footnote{Blanc (\citeyear[6--7]{Blanc1964}) considers /p/ and /\v{c}/ as characteristic of \ili{Mesopotamian} varieties.} The emergence of these phonemes is most likely due to the massive contact with \ili{Turkish}, \ili{Kurdish} and \ili{Aramaic}. That is, the most likely scenario is that the centuries-long borrowing of words which contained these sounds ultimately resulted in them getting incorporated into the phonemic inventory.


With regard to /v/, it is likely that there are two paths of emergence: (i) as an internal evolution of the voiced interdental fricative /ð/ and (ii) via loan-words from \ili{Turkish} and \ili{Kurdish}. The forms \textit{vīp} and \textit{zīp} `wolf' (cf. \ili{OA} \textit{ðiʔb} `wolf') represent a language internal development, whereby the interdental fricatives have shifted to {sibilants} in \ili{Kozluk–Sason–Muş}, and to labiodental fricatives in Āzəx (Şırnak province, \citealt{Wittrich2001}), whereas they have been retained in most \ili{Mardin} group dialects.\footnote{For more discussion, see \citet{Wittrich2001}, \citet{Jastrow2011anatolian}, \citet{Grigore2007article}, \citet{Talay2011}, \citet{Akkus2017}, and \cite{Bituna2016} among others. }

In many cases, it is impossible to pinpoint which language these sounds were (initially) borrowed from. However, as also noted in Proch\'{a}zka (this volume),\ia{Procházka, Stephan@Procházka, Stephan} /p/ was probably introduced via contact with \ili{Kurdish}, followed by influence from \ili{Ottoman} and Modern \ili{Turkish}.\footnote{For further illustrations and discussion, see e.g. \citet{VockeWaldner1982}, \citet{Jastrow2011anatolian}, Talay (\citeyear{Talay2002,Talay2007}) and \citet{GrigoreBituna2012}.} Some illustrations are as follows:

\ea
\noindent \textit{p\={i}s} `dirty', cf. \ili{Kurdish}/\ili{Turkish} \textit{p\^{i}s, pis}\\
\textit{par\v{c}\={a}ye} `piece', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{par\c{c}a}\\
\textit{p\={u}z} `nose' (\ili{Ḥapəs}), cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{poz}\\
\textit{davare} `ramp', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{dever} fem. `place'\\
\textit{\v{c}uv\={a}le} `sack', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{\c{c}uval} \\
\textit{pēlāv} (\d{H}ask\"{o}y) `shoe', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{p\^{e}lav}\\
\textit{\v{c}\={a}y} `tea', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{\c{c}ay}\\
\textit{\v{c}aqm\={a}q} `lighter', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{\c{c}akmak}\\
\textit{rēnčbarī} (\ili{Hasköy}), \textit{rē\v{z}barī} (\ili{Sason}) `husbandry', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{rêncberî}\\
\textit{žīžo} (\ili{Āzəḫ}) `hedgehog', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{jîjo} \\
\textit{ṭāži} `greyhound', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{tajî} \\
\textit{g\={o}mlak} `shirt', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{g\"{o}mlek}\\
\textit{magz\={u}n}, \textit{mazg\={u}n} (in \ili{Sason}) `sickle', cf. \ili{Syriac} \textit{magz\={u}n\={a}}; \ili{Ṭuroyo} \textit{magz\={u}no}\\
\z

\cite{Talay2007} suggests that the loss of the phonemic status of the {emphatic consonants} and the weakness of the {pharyngeal} in \ili{Kozluk–Sason–Muş} group is likely due to the influence of \ili{Turkish}, which does not have them. Examples are from the \ili{Hasköy} dialect, and are taken from Talay (\citeyear{Talay2007}: 181):

\protectedex{
\ea
\noindent \textit{ata} `he gave' (< *ʔaʕ\d{t}ā), cf. \textit{ad\={a}} in \ili{Sason}\\
\textit{sēbi} `boy' (< *\d{s}abiyy)\\
\textit{zarab} `he hit' (< *\d{ð}arab < *\d{d}arab)\\
\z
}

Thus, changes of this kind can be seen as a quasi-adaptation of the consonant inventory to that of the {superstrate} and {adstrate} languages.

\subsubsection{Word-final devoicing}

Certain voiced stops in Anatolian \ili{Arabic} /b, d, ǧ, g/ have a tendency to become devoiced [p, t, č, k] when they occur word-finally, probably due to \ili{Turkish} influence, which is well-known for this property.

For instance, /b/ is mainly realized as the voiceless [p] in final pre-pausal position, e.g.: \textit{anep} `grape(s)',
cf. \ili{OA} \textit{ʕinab}; \textit{ɣarīp} `stranger', cf. \ili{OA} \textit{ɣarīb}. This might reflect a change in progress, as \cite{Lahdo2009} points out that the incidence of {devoicing} in other Anatolian dialects is also increasing over time. Note that the {devoicing} process does not take place in all instances, supporting the claim that the language is
undergoing a transition in this regard. Moreover, the lack of a written form removes a possible brake on this process. Further illustrations are as follows:

\ea
\noindent \textit{axa[θ]} `he took’\\
\textit{kata[p]} `he wrote’ (\ili{Mardin}; \citealt[90]{Jastrow2011anatolian})\\
\textit{kt\={e}[p]} `book' (\ili{Mardin}), cf. \ili{OA} \textit{kit\={a}b}\\
\textit{baʕī[t]} `far' (\ili{Āzəḫ}), cf. \ili{OA} \textit{baʕ\={i}d}\\
\textit{a\d{t}ya[p]} `nicer' (\ili{Tillo}), cf. \ili{OA} \textit{ʔa\d{t}yab} \\
\textit{azya[t]} `more', cf. \ili{OA} \textit{ʔazyad} (\citealt[106]{Lahdo2009})\\
\z

\noindent Devoicing is not limited to word-final position, however, but is also attested before voiceless consonants, e.g. \textit{haps} `prison', cf. \ili{OA} \textit{ḥabs}. %Other illustrations are \textit{təšreb} `you (\textsc{sg.m}) drink', \textit{šrəpt} `you (\textsc{sg.m}) drank' or \textit{təmseg} `you (\textsc{sg.m}) catch', \textit{masakt} `you (\textsc{sg.m}) caught', cf. \ili{OA} \textit{tamsiku} `you (\textsc{sg.m}) caught'.

\subsection{Morphology}
The influence of language contact is also observable in the domain of morphology.  For example, as discussed by Prochazka (\citeyear{Procházka2018Anatolian}: 182--183),  the {numerals} 11--19  in the \ili{Kozluk}--\ili{Sason} region show inversion of the unit and decimal positions, e.g. \textit{ʕašṛa sətte} (and not \textit{sətt ʕašra}) `sixteen'. See also Procházka (this volume) for discussion of the personal pronouns.

Some other cases of contact-induced changes such as {reduplication}, degree in adjectives and {compounds} are discussed below.



\subsubsection{Reduplication}

A type of {reduplication} due to contact with \ili{Turkish} produces doublets with /m/. The consonant /m/ may be added initially to vowel-initial words, as in \REF{redup1}, or replaces the initial consonants in consonant-initial words, as in \REF{redup2} (see \citealt{Akkus2017,Lahdo2009}). The {reduplication} conveys vagueness, with a meaning paraphrasable with `et cetera' or `something like that'.

\ea\label{redup} \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}
		\ea \label{redup1}\gll a\v{z}\={i}n m-a\v{z}\={i}n\\
        dough m-dough\\
        \glt `dough or something like that'


	\ex \label{redup2} \gll h\={a}s m-\={a}s l\={a} təso \\
        sound m-sound \textsc{neg} make.\textsc{impf.2pl}\\
        \glt `Don't make any noise!' (Lit. `Don't make sound or something like that.') %\hfill (\ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic})
\z
\z

\noindent Following the same restriction in \ili{Turkish}, if a word starts with /m/, this type of {reduplication} is disallowed, e.g. \textit{m\={a}se} `table' cannot be reduplicated in a way that would result in \textit{m\={a}se} \textit{m\={a}se}.


\subsubsection{Degree in adjectives}
Adjectives in Anatolian \ili{Arabic} follow the noun directly, agreeing with it in {gender}, number, and {definiteness}. In this respect, the situation is similar to most \ili{Arabic} varieties. Degree, on the other hand, is not an {inflectional} category in \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}. Instead, this dialect has adopted the \ili{Turkish} adverbs \textit{daha} `more' and \textit{en} `most' for {comparative} and {superlative}, respectively. Both these items precede the adjectival constituent, as shown in \REF{adj1} and \REF{adj2}.

\ea \label{adj} \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}
		\ea \label{adj1}\gll mənn-i daha koys-e ye\\
   from-\textsc{obl.1sg} more beautiful-\textsc{f} \textsc{cop.3sg} \\
        \glt `She is more beautiful than me.'


	\ex \label{adj2} \gll en gbīr  \\
        most big\\
        \glt `the biggest'
\z
\z

\noindent The \ili{Tillo} variety also uses the \ili{Turkish}-derived \textit{an} `most' in {superlative} forms, with both \ili{Arabic}-derived adjectives (in the {elative} form) and \ili{Turkish}-derived adjectives (which lack an {elative} form), as in \REF{adjt1} and \REF{adjt1} respectively.\largerpage

\z
\end{multicols}}
\footnotetext{\cite{Lahdo2009} describes this vowel as ``short front-to-back unrounded'' in \ili{Tillo}.}
\z
\clearpage

\noindent  On the other hand, the {comparative} in the \ili{Tillo} variety is formed through the {elative} alone (which functions in other \ili{Arabic} varieties as both {comparative} and {superlative}). The standard of comparison is introduced by the {preposition} \textit{mən} `from'.

\ea\label{adjt3} \langinfo{Tillo Arabic}{}{\citealt[162]{Lahdo2009}}\\
\gll təllo 	iyy 		aṭyap mən 	ə\d{s}ṭanbūl\\
     \ili{Tillo}	\textsc{cop.3sg}	good.\textsc{ela}	than	Istanbul \\
\glt `\ili{Tillo} is better than Istanbul.'
\z

%This {superlative} form in \ili{Sason} and \ili{Tillo} is most likely due to contact with \ili{Turkish}.


\subsubsection{Derivational affixes}

Through numerous {loanwords}, a few {derivational} suffixes have been introduced into Anatolian \ili{Arabic}. These suffixes include the agentive morpheme \textit{-\v{g}i/-\v{c}i}, and the abessive suffix \textit{-səz}, which translates as `without'. Ingham (\citeyear[178]{Ingham2011afg}) points out that these suffixes, especially the former, are also found in the dialects of Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere (see also \citealt{Procházka-Eisl2018} for further details).

\ea
\ea \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}
\\ \gll gahwa-\v{g}i \\
coffee-\textsc{agt}\\
\glt `coffee maker'

\ex \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} \\
\gll vi\v{g}dan-səz \\
conscience-\textsc{abess}\\
\glt `unconscientious'

\ex \ili{Tillo} \ili{Arabic} (\citealt[199]{Lahdo2009})\\
\gll kəlla k\={a}nu m\d{t}ahhər-\v{c}i-yye \\
all be.\textsc{prf.3pl} circumcizer-\textsc{agt-pl}\\
\glt  `They all were circumcizers.'
\z
\z


\noindent The presence of these suffixes on lexemes of the local \ili{Arabic} varieties, e.g. \textit{ḫ\={a}ser-\v{g}i} `yogurt maker, yogurt seller' (\ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}) or \textit{m\d{t}ahhər-\v{c}i} `circumsiser' (\ili{Tillo} \ili{Arabic}), suggests that the forms above are not necessarily adopted as a whole. Rather, \ili{Arabic} speakers may decompose the word and apply the suffix to other lexemes in some cases.

\subsubsection{Compounds}

Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has borrowed the N+N compounding strategy from \ili{Turkish}, where the right-hand member carries the compound linker morpheme \textit{-i}. This pattern is not generally found in other varieties of \ili{Arabic} and it is most likely due to contact with \ili{Turkish}. This type of compound is  often used with whole \ili{Turkish} phrases. The examples are as follows (note that the buffer consonant \textit{-s} appears between the linker morpheme and the noun when the noun ends in a vowel):

\ea \label{coms} \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} (\citealt[41]{AkkusBenmamoun2018})
		\ea \label{com1}\gll lisa		mudur-i\\
    high\_school director-\textsc{link} \\
        \glt `high school director'


	\ex \label{com2} \gll qurs 	oratman-i  \\
        course	teacher-\textsc{link}\\
        \glt `course teacher'
\z
      \ex \label{comt} \ili{Tillo} \ili{Arabic} (\citealt[199]{Lahdo2009})\\
      \gll fəstəq fabriqa-si \\
        pistachio factory-\textsc{link}\\
        \glt `pistachio factory'
\z

\noindent This compounding strategy is found in other \ili{Arabic} varieties spoken in Turkey as well, for instance, \textit{buz dolab-i} `refrigerator' (lit. `ice cupboard-\textsc{link}') in the Adana dialect. Whether compounding has been borrowed as a productive process as opposed to borrowing of the whole phrase requires further investigation.\footnote{Thanks to Stephan Proch\'{a}zka for the discussion and the example from the Adana dialect.}



\subsubsection{Vocative ending -\textit{o}}
Another morphological feature that Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has acquired is the {vocative} particle -\textit{o}. When addressing a person directly, \textit{-o} is commonly affixed to kinship terms and given names. This appears to be available in the whole area. Unlike the situation in Syria and Iraq (see Proch\'{a}zka, this volume), this form of address is not usually used hypocoristically. Some examples are below:\ia{Procházka, Stephan@Procházka, Stephan}

\ea
\noindent \textit{amm-o} `(paternal) uncle!'\\
\textit{ǧem\={a}l-o} `Cemal!'\\
\textit{ḫāl-o} `(maternal) uncle!'\\
\z

\noindent The corresponding forms of feminine nouns end in -\textit{\={e}}, as in \textit{ḥabībt-ē} `darling!'. Grigore (\citeyear[203]{Grigore2007book}) suggests that this {vocative} -\textit{o} is borrowing of a morphological form from \ili{Kurdish} (cf. \citealt{HaigÖpengin2018}), since the suffix, with masculine and feminine forms, is not historically available in \ili{Arabic}. Note, however, the existence of cognates in other \ili{Semitic} languages and \textit{-u} in the whole of North Africa, where \ili{Kurdish} influence is not likely (see Prochazka, this volume).


In brief, contact with \ili{Turkish} and other neighboring languages has led to various noticeable changes in the morphology of Anatolian \ili{Arabic}, particularly the more easterly varieties.

\subsection{Syntax}
Research on the syntax of Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties, let alone work on contact-induced syntactic changes, lags significantly behind the research conducted on other aspects of these languages. Several factors might have contributed to this situation. Researchers' tendency to focus on phonological or lexical aspects and the lack of sufficient data from which to draw conclusions  are two possible factors. Another possibility that \cite{Ingham2005} raises for contact-induced syntactic change is that since the languages in contact are so typologically different, it is difficult for them to adopt syntactic features from each other without extensive {language change} taking place.


This section introduces several syntactic phenomena that can be attributed to language contact, including copulas, marking of indefiniteness, {light verb} constructions and the {periphrastic causative}. Although the details are not elaborated on here, the conclusion we can arrive at is in line with \cite{Ingham2005}, in that the degree and intensity of contact with the neighboring languages leads to differences among Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects. The more easterly varieties, e.g. the \ili{Kozluk–Sason–Muş} group, appear to be the most innovative, and the dialect group(s) most influenced by the language contact, whereas the \ili{Mardin} group appears to be the most conservative (see \citealt{Akkus2017,Jastrow2011anatolian} for further discussion).

\subsubsection{Copula}

One of the most distinctive features of Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is the existence of the {copula} in nominal sentences, based on the independent pronouns. This {copula} is realized as an enclitic suffix in most Anatolian dialects. Although researchers seem to differ with respect to the degree of the influence, they converge on the view that it is a matter of language contact, and that at least the development and the proliferation of the obligatory {copula} is under the influence of the neighboring languages -- \ili{Turkish}, \ili{Kurdish}, \ili{Zazaki} and \ili{Aramaic} -- which all have copulas in nonverbal clauses (see \citealt{Lahdo2009,Grigore2007article,Palva2011,Talay2007,Jastrow2011anatolian,Akkus2016,Akkus2017,AkkusBenmamoun2018}, for more discussion and illustrations).

Although the {copula} forms themselves are not imported, the way they are used in Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is exactly the same as it is in \ili{Kurdish}, \ili{Turkish} and \ili{Ṭuroyo} (\ili{Aramaic}), which have {copula} in the present {tense}. The {copula} is placed after the predicate (examples from \citealt{Grigore2007article}).


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{cop}
		\begin{xlist}
		\ex \ili{Kurdish} \\\label{copkrm}\gll bav-ê min şivan-e		\\
    father-\textsc{ez} \textsc{poss.1sg}		shepherd-\textsc{cop.3sg} \\
       \glt `My father is a shepherd.'

	\ex \ili{Turkish} \\
	\label{coptk} \gll baba-m 		çoban-dır\\
	father-\textsc{poss.1sg}		shepherd-\textsc{3sg}\\
        \glt  `My father is a shepherd.'


		\ex \ili{Ṭuroyo}\\ \label{copara} \gll  bab-i		rəʕyo-yo\\
		father-\textsc{poss.1sg}		herder-\textsc{3sg}\\
      \glt  `My father is a herder.'
        \end{xlist}

\end{exe}


\noindent Some examples from Anatolian \ili{Arabic} are illustrated in \REF{copt}.\footnote{It should be noted that the {copula} is not necessarily realized as an enclitic in some dialects. For instance, in the dialect of \ili{Siirt} (\citealt{Jastrow2011anatolian}) the {copula} precedes the
predicate. Moreover, the {copula} is identical to the personal pronoun in \ili{Siirt}, whereas other Anatolian varieties use the shortened version of the pronoun in the 3\textsc{sg} and 3\textsc{pl}. See \cite{Akkus2016} for some discussion. }

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{copt}
		\begin{xlist}
		\ex \ili{Kinderib} \ili{Arabic} (\citealt[131]{Jastrow1978}) \\\label{copkr}\gll malī\d{h}-we		\\
    beautiful-\textsc{3sg.m} \\
       \glt `He is beautiful.'

	\ex \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} \\
	\label{copts} \gll raḫw-īn nen\\
	sick-\textsc{pl} \textsc{3pl}\\
        \glt  `They are sick.'

		\ex \ili{Daragözü} \ili{Arabic} (\citealt[40]{Jastrow1973})\\ \label{coparam} \gll  nā ḅāš-nā\\
		\textsc{1sg} good-\textsc{1sg}\\
      \glt  `I am good.'
        \end{xlist}

\end{exe}

%\noindent The paradigms from several dialects are given in \autoref{tab:1}. Some of the paradigms are not complete due to the original source (\ili{Siirt} from \textcite{jastrow2006anatolian}, \ili{Cypriot} \ili{Arabic} from \textcite{borg1985}, \ili{Mardin} data from \textcite{grigore2007} and \ili{Daragözü} from \textcite{jastrow1973}) .
%The {copula} has the form of the independent personal pronouns or derived from them. \ili{Siirt}, \ili{Mardin}, \ili{Daragözü}, Cyrpiot Maronite \ili{Arabic} are such dialects.

%\end{tabularx}
%\caption{Copula in some Anatolian Arabic varieties}
%\label{tab:copula}
%\end{table}

\noindent In negative sentences as well, the same order of morphemes is attested. The negative morpheme (and the {copula} if there is one) follows the predicate in the neighboring languages, as the sentences in \REF{copneg} show.


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{copneg}
		\begin{xlist}
		\ex \ili{Turkish} \\\label{copnegtk}\gll hasta 	değil-ler		\\
    sick	\textsc{neg.cop-3pl} \\
       \glt `They are not sick.'
	\ex \ili{Kurdish} \\\label{copnegkr}  \gll kemal	xwendekar  	nîn-e	 \\
    Kemal	student		\textsc{neg-cop.3sg}\\
    \glt    `Kemal is not a student.'

		\ex \ili{Zazaki} \\ \label{copnegza} \gll  cinya 	niwaş   ni-yo\\
        child	sick	\textsc{neg-cop.3sg} \\
        \glt `The child is not sick.'
        \end{xlist}

\end{exe}


\noindent  The same order is found in \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}, in that the \textsc{neg+cop} follows the predicate.\footnote{This is not the most common order in Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties, however. For more discussion, see \cite{Jastrow2011anatolian} and \cite{Akkus2016,Akkus2017}.}

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{copnegsa} \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}\\
\gll nihane me-nnen	\\
here 	\textsc{neg-cop.3pl} \\
        \glt `They are not here.'\footnote{In \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}, the 3\textsc{pl} personal pronoun can be \textit{innen} or \textit{iyen}. A shortened version of this pronoun is used both in affirmative, as in (\ref{copts}) and negative, as in (\ref{copnegsa}), non-verbal clauses. }
\end{exe}

\noindent Given that the {copula} is almost unknown in other \ili{Arabic} speaking areas (but see \citealt{Blanc1964}; also Lucas \& Čéplö, this volume; Walter, this volume), it is safe to assume that the development of a full morphological paradigm for the {copula} along with its syntactic function is at least facilitated by contact with the neighboring languages.\ia{Walter, Mary Ann@Walter, Mary Ann}\ia{Lucas, Christopher@Lucas, Christopher}\ia{Čéplö, Slavomír@Čéplö, Slavomír}


\subsubsection{Light verb construction}


Light verb constructions are another domain where the influence of contact is clearly manifested. In surrounding languages, particularly \ili{Turkish}, \ili{Kurdish} and \ili{Zazaki}, a {light verb} construction consists of a nominal part followed by the {light verb}, which is usually `to do' or `to be', e.g. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{pacî kirin} (lit. `kiss do') `to kiss', \ili{Turkish} \textit{motive etmek} (lit. `motivation do') `to motivate’.

There are a relatively large number of compound verbs constructed with \ili{Arabic} \textit{s\={a}wa} – \textit{ys\={a}wi} `to do' and a nominal borrowed from \ili{Turkish} or \ili{Kurdish}, as illustrated in \REF{light}. In the majority of the cases, the construction is a complete {calque} of its \ili{Turkish} or \ili{Kurdish} counterparts (see e.g. \citealt{Versteegh1997,Lahdo2009,Grigore2007article,Talay2007,Jastrow2011anatolian,Akkus2016,Akkus2017,AkkusBenmamoun2018} and \citealt{Bituna2016} for more examples).



\begin{exe}
\ex \label{light}
		\begin{xlist}
		\ex \ili{Āzəḫ}/\ili{Mardin} \ili{Arabic} \citep[184]{Talay2007}\\ \textit{s\={a}wa brīndār} `to injure',	cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{brîndar kirin}\\
\textit{s\={a}wa \v{g}āmērtīye} `to act generously', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{camêrtî kirin}\\
\textit{s\={a}wa ɣōt} `to mow', cf. \ili{Kurdish}  \textit{cot kirin}


	\ex \label{com3} \ili{Tillo} \ili{Arabic} \citep[202]{Lahdo2009}\\ \textit{s\={a}wa yārdəm} `to help', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{yardım etmek}\\
\textit{ys\={a}waw dawām} `they continue …', cf.  \ili{Turkish} \textit{devam etmek}\\
\textit{nsayy qa\d{h}waltə} `we have breakfast', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{kahvalt{\i} etmek}
		\end{xlist}

\end{exe}



\noindent In \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}, the default order in this construction has reversed, in that in most cases the nominal is followed by the {light verb}. Thus, \ili{Sason} manifests head-final order, undoubtedly due to contact with \ili{Turkish} and \ili{Kurdish}. Similarly, the nominal part of the construction can be borrowed from \ili{Turkish} as in \REF{l}, including instances of reborrowing of an originally \ili{Arabic} word, \REF{ltk1}, or \ili{Kurdish} as in \REF{l3}. In fact, the nominal part might also be \ili{Arabic}, as in \REF{lar}.

        \glt `We attacked.'
		\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

\noindent Anatolian \ili{Arabic} usually resorts to the same periphrastic construction when borrowing verbs from \ili{Turkish}; it creates a complex predicate, rather than adapting a foreign verb directly to \ili{Arabic} verbal morphology, a borrowing strategy seen also in the other languages in the region, such as \ili{Kurdish}, \ili{Zazaki}. In many cases, the complex predicate comprises of \textit{s\={a}wa} + the \ili{Turkish} verbal form of the indefinite past (i.e. \textit{mi\c{s}}-verb), rather than the bare form of the verb, as illustrated in \REF{turkverb}.

\ea \label{turkverb} Anatolian \ili{Arabic} \citep[184]{Talay2007}\\
\noindent \textit{sawa gačənməš} `to manage', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{geçinmiş}\\
\textit{ba\v{s}lamə\v{s} sawa} `to begin',  cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{başlamış} \\
\z

Despite the widespread use of this process for {loanwords}, some borrowed verbal forms have been totally assimilated to the \ili{Arabic}
verbal system; the majority of these verbs are formed according to verbal measures (stems) II or III, as can be seen in example \REF{azex}.

Stem III & \textit{\d{d}āyan – ī\d{d}āyən} `to be patient, to bear up' & cf. \ili{Tr.} \textit{dayanmak}\\
Stem III & \textit{tēlan} – \textit{ītēlən} `to rob' & cf. \ili{Kr.} \textit{talan kirin} \\
\end{tabular}
\z


 \subsubsection{Marking of (in)definiteness}


In \ili{Classical} \ili{Arabic} and in modern varieties spoken in the Arab world, the indefinite {noun phrase} is unmarked or is preceded by an independent indefinite particle, whereas an NP becomes {definite} by prefixing the {definite} {article} \textit{al-/əl-/l-} etc. (\citealt{Brustad2000}). However, \ili{Kozluk–Sason–Muş} group dialects have adopted the reverse pattern (see also \ili{Uzbekistan} \ili{Arabic}; \citealt{Jastrow2005}), which is found in the neighboring languages \ili{Turkish} and \ili{Kurdish}. That is, the {definite} NP is left unmarked, and the enclitic \textit{-ma} is used to mark the indefiniteness of an NP (\citealt{Talay2007,Akkus2016,Akkus2017,AkinJastrowTalay2017,AkkusBenmamoun2018}), as illustrated in \REF{ma}.

\ea \label{ma} \ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic}
\textit{mara} `the woman' > \textit{mara-ma} `a woman' \\
\textit{bayt} `the house' > \textit{bayt-ma} `a house'
\z

\noindent The parallel constructions in \ili{Kurdish} and \ili{Turkish} are illustrated in \REF{defkr} and \REF{deftk} respectively.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{defkr} \ili{Kurdish}\\	\textit{derɪ}̂ `the door' 	$>$ \textit{derɪ́-\textbf{yek}} `a door'
\ex \label{deftk} \ili{Turkish}\\	\textit{kadın} `the woman' $>$ \textit{\textbf{bir} kadın} `a woman' (\ili{Turkish})
\end{exe}


\subsubsection{Periphrastic causative}

\ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} resorts to {periphrastic causative} constructions rather than the {root and pattern} strategy found in other non-peripheral \ili{Arabic} varieties. In this respect it is on a par with \ili{Kurdish}, which uses the {light verb} \textit{bıdın} ‘to give’ to form the {causative}, as in \REF{perrk}.\largerpage

\ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} exhibits the same pattern for {causative} and applicative {formation}, as shown in \REF{persa}, which is most likely as a result of extensive contact with \ili{Kurdish}.\footnote{\ili{Sason} \ili{Arabic} also has another periphrastic construction that is formed with the verb \textit{sa} `to do/make', which may embed a finite clause \REF{makefin} or a verbal-{noun phrase} \REF{makeinf}.

\subsection{Lexicon}

Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects have borrowed single words and whole phrases or expressions mainly from (\ili{Ottoman} and Modern) \ili{Turkish} and \ili{Kurdish}. The influence of these two languages on the \ili{Arabic} lexicon is enormous. \ili{Aramaic} words also survive in Anatolian \ili{Arabic} to a lesser degree. A few illustrations are given in \REF{lex}.\footnote{See Vocke \& Waldner (\citeyear{VockeWaldner1982}: xxxix--li) for detailed statistics on \ili{Kurdish}/\ili{Turkish}/\ili{Aramaic} {loanwords}. See also Lahdo (\citeyear{Lahdo2009}: 207--223) for a comprehensive glossary of \ili{Turkish} and \ili{Kurdish} {loanwords} in \ili{Tillo} \ili{Arabic}, most of which are found in other Anatolian \ili{Arabic} varieties as well.}


\ea \label{lex}
\noindent \textit{b\={o}\v{s}} `much', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{bo\c{s}}\\
\textit{b\={o}\v{s}qa} `different', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{ba\c{s}ka}\\
\textit{\d{r}\={u}vi} `fox', cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{rûvî}\\
\textit{hi\v{c}} `none, whatsoever', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{hī\c{c}}\\
\textit{səpor} `sport', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{spor}\\

\noindent As Jastrow (\citeyear[95]{Jastrow2011anatolian}) mentions, while more \ili{Turkish} borrowings are found in bigger cities such as \ili{Mardin}, \ili{Diyarbakır} or \ili{Siirt}, \ili{Kurdish} borrowings constitute a bigger part of the lexicon of rural dialects. Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects which have preserved the emphatics, {pharyngeals} or interdentals adapt borrowings into their phonology. For instance, \ili{Turkish} \textit{halbuki} `however' is borrowed as \textit{\d{h}\={a}lb\={u}ki}. In most cases, the velar \textit{k} is turned into the uvular \textit{q}, e.g. \textit{\v{c}aqm\={a}q} `lighter', cf. \ili{Turkish} \textit{\c{c}akmak}. Also, \ili{Kurdish} feminine nouns (and even some \ili{Turkish} nouns) are suffixed with the \ili{Arabic} feminine morpheme \textit{-e/-a}, e.g. \textit{t\={u}re} `shoulder' (cf. \ili{Kurdish} \textit{t\^{u}r}).


There are several function words that are copied from \ili{Turkish} into \ili{Arabic}, e.g. \ili{Turkish} \textit{ama} `but' is realized as \textit{hama} in \ili{Sason}, and as \textit{a\d{m}a} in \ili{Tillo} \ili{Arabic}. The conjunction \textit{\c{c}\"{u}nk\"{u}} `because' from \ili{Turkish} is attested in many Anatolian varieties, with the same function. Lahdo (\citeyear[179]{Lahdo2009}) notes that it expresses causal clauses in \ili{Tillo}, as in (\ref{cunku}), and Biţună  (\citeyear[213]{Bituna2016}) reports the same role for \ili{Siirt}. Jastrow (\citeyear[278]{Jastrow1981}) and Grigore (\citeyear[261]{Grigore2007book}) also confirm its existence in Ḥalanze and \ili{Mardin}, respectively.

\begin{exe}

\textsc{neg} give.\textsc{prf.3pl}-\textsc{1sg} permission because come.\textsc{prf.1sg} to-Ankara\\
\glt `They did not give me permission because I had come to Ankara.'
\end{exe}


\noindent \cite{Procházka2005} notes that particles such as \textit{b\={i}le} < \textit{bile} `even', or \textit{z\={a}tan} < \textit{zaten} `already' in the Adana region are also borrowed from \ili{Turkish} (see also \citealt{Isaksson2005}).

\section{Conclusion}

This chapter has dealt with contact-induced changes in the Anatolian \ili{Arabic} dialects. We have seen that Anatolian \ili{Arabic} has been primarily in contact with \ili{Turkish}, \ili{Kurdish} and \ili{Aramaic}, and the influence of these neighboring languages on Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is evident. We have surveyed some contact-induced changes at the phonological, morphological, syntactic and lexical level. %In particular, the influence of \ili{Kurdish} (and to some extent \ili{Turkish}) on Anatolian \ili{Arabic} is clear in terms of changes at the syntax level.


\ili{Mardin} and \ili{Siirt} dialects have been covered much more comprehensively than other dialects in the literature. It is desirable to have more comprehensive investigations carried out for the dialects around the \ili{Bitlis}, ili{Muş} and \ili{Diyarbakır} areas. This research has the potential to fill the gaps in our current state of knowledge about these dialects.


Similarly, in terms of the linguistic features investigated, phonological and morphological properties (along with lexicon) have received more attention in the literature, whereas syntax, in particular, has been understudied. This situation, however, might change once we are at a point where we have enough recordings and transcriptions to investigate syntactic properties of the dialects.
