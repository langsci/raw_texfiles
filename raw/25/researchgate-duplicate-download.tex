Thanks for your interest in my document! Research Gate keeps asking me whether publications where
authored by me although they are already in my profile. I add these publications to my profile, but there is no userfriendly way to merge duplicates. The
only way to do this is by making all the details of the two publications identical. This is tedious
and I will not do this but wait for RG to implement the handling of duplicates in the way it is done in Google Scholar.

All my publications are online. You may use RG to find the correct item or visit my web site or
google scholar.

Thanks!
