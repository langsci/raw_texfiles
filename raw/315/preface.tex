\addchap{\lsPrefaceTitle}
This book is a revised version of my doctoral dissertation which I defended at the University of Helsinki in November 2020 \citep{bahrt:2020}. While all chapters have undergone some changes, the most notable differences between this book and the original doctoral dissertation can be seen in the introduction (Chapter \ref{introduction}), in the descriptions of previous research on voice syncretism (\sectref{geniusiene-syncretism} and \sectref{haspelmath-syncretism}), and in the discussions of voice syncretism and its distribution (Chapter \ref{sect:distribution}). The introductory chapter has been entirely rewritten to provide a more comprehensive introduction to the study of voice syncretism, and now also introduces an important distinction between minimal and maximal syncretism not maintained in the dissertation. This distinction is intended to make the discussion of voice syncretism, its previous research and its distribution more transparent. Furthermore, most tables and figures have been reworked -- and some have been merged -- to provide a better reading experience. Finally, several typographical errors have been corrected, accidentally omitted sources have been duly added to the list of references, and disarranged data in Appendices B and C have been fixed.

I am particularly thankful to the series editor, Martin Haspelmath, for giving me the opportunity to publish this revised version of my doctoral dissertation at Language Science Press and for his insightful comments that helped enhance the manuscript for this book in numerous ways. I am also grateful to all the proofreaders and anonymous reviewers who took their time to carefully read the manuscript and provide valuable suggestions on how it could be further improved. Finally, I want to thank Sebastian Nordhoff for all his help in preparing and typesetting the manuscript for publication.
