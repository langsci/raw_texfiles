\addchap{\lsAcknowledgementTitle} 
I wish to offer my special thanks to the primary supervisor of my original doctoral dissertation, Seppo Kittilä, for his mentorship and support through the years. I also extend my sincere thanks to the secondary supervisors of the dissertation, Matti Miestamo and Kaius Sinnemäki, for their guidance and counsel. Additionally, I would like to express my gratitude to Andrej Malchukov -- whose work has served as an inspiration for my exploration of voice syncretism -- for his willingness to serve as the opponent at my doctoral defence and for all his valuable advice.
