\chapter{Explanation of statistical measures}\label{s}
In the following, we provide the explanation of statistical measures  and significance codes used in Tables \ref{T15:r} and \ref{T16.7a}--\ref{T16.11}

\begin{description}[font=\normalfont]
\item[Var.:] Estimated variance of the random effects.
\item[SD:]  Standard deviation corresponding to the estimated variance of the random effects.
\item[Est.:] Estimated value of the coefficient for the fixed effects.
\item[SE:] Standard error of the coefficient for the fixed effects.
\item[$z$:] The value of the z statistic corresponding to the estimated value of the fixed-effect coefficient.
\item[$\text{Pr}(>|z|)$:] Probability of obtaining the given value of the z statistic or a value greater than the one which was obtained, assuming that the null hypothesis is true; statistical significance is marked as follows: $p<0.001$ (***), $p<0.01$ (**), $p<0.05$ (*), $p<0.1$.
