\title{Parametric variation: The case of Brazilian Portuguese null subjects}

\abstract{This chapter revisits comparative and diachronic studies of linguists
    analysing Brazilian Portuguese (BP) with regard to the NSP, especially in view
    of recent debates on the existence of the so-called partial null subject
    languages. It will be shown that BP is losing the properties of a
    prototypical NSL like European Portuguese (EP), with a rich inflectional
    paradigm, but, as the change is very recent, there is still not a consensus
    regarding the target of the change. Our question is whether BP classifies
    as a PNS language like Finnish, Hebrew or Marathi, as was recently claimed
    in \textcite{Holmberg2010}, and \textcite{HolShee2010}. Methodologically,
    it is our purpose to observe the overt and null subjects in real data so as
    to check whether eventual optionality of null and overt pronouns can be
    attributed to a grammatical competition from a diachronic perspective
    \parencite{Kroch1994} or to some licensing possibility within a single type
    of grammar, which is normally a view taken by formal linguists analyzing
    synchronic data. Using acquisition\is{language acquisition} data we will show that while null
    non-referential subjects are part of Brazilian \isi{core grammar}, null
    referential subjects are not, and their existence in the production of
    Brazilian literate adults results from instruction through schooling. The
    chapter suggests that from a typological view BP is a semi-NS language like
    Icelandic.}

\section{The null subject parameter: A background}

Since the advent of the principles and parameters model within the government
and binding theory (\citealt{Chomsky1981,Rizzi:1982}, a.o), the \gls{NSP} has
received the widest range of discussions and refinements.  Not only did its
formal formulation deserve a lot of attention, but its typological binary
concept (\citealt{Chomsky1981}, based on \citealt{Taraldsen1978}) gave rise to
a new way to do comparative and historical linguistics.  But
\citet[144]{Rizzi:1982} soon pointed to the fact that what was considered a
single parameter should be decomposed into two sub-parameters,\is{parameters} distinguishing
languages allowing both null referential and expletive\is{expletives} subjects from those
licensing only null expletives (what he calls \emph{semi-pro-drop}
languages)\footnote{Which we will later call semi-[non-NS] languages, after
\citet{Biberauer2010}.} (e.g.\ \ili{Italian} vs.\ \ili{German}).

Further studies in the 1980s and 1990s would show that morphological
richness\footnote{“The intuitive idea is that where there is overt agreement,
the subject can be dropped, since the deletion is recoverable”
\parencite[241]{Chomsky1981}.} was not sufficient to explain licensing and
identification of null subjects. \citegen{Huang1984} classic article showed
that null subjects were also licensed in systems like Chinese, without any
inflection for mood, tense, number and person, which led to a new hypothesis
\parencite{JaeggliSafir1989}, according to which what licenses null subjects is
not a “rich” inflectional verbal paradigm but its morphological uniformity.  In
the case of a paradigm consisting of different affixes, identification would
occur through agreement markers; in the case of a paradigm consisting of a
single stem, identification would be possible through a discursive topic. In
the first case the NS would be a pronominal category; in the second, a
variable. If, however, a paradigm is mixed, the NS would not be licensed.

\citet{Roberts1993} would bring new contributions to the discussion based on
diachronic evidence from medieval \ili{French}. He argued that a “functionally”
rich paradigm, i.e.\ with a zero ending and two identical forms for different
grammatical persons, could act as a “formally” rich one.
\citeauthor{Roberts1993}, however, pointed out the fact that the limit of
syncretic forms could not be exceeded. This proposal has been used to explain
licensing of null subjects in European Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese
before the latter underwent a change in its inflectional paradigm, as we will
show in \Cref{sec:26.2.2}.

The cluster of properties, which has been crucially related to the \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages}
since the classical formulation of the \gls{NSP}, has not been thoroughly
confirmed in more than thirty years of research, which has led to negative
conclusions and certain scepticism with respect to the principles and
parameters theory, according to \citet{RobHol2010}.

\glsunset{PNS} In recent years, in the light of new theoretical and empirical
evidence, the notion of “partially” null subject (\gls{PNS}) languages has been
introduced (cf.\ \citealt{Holmberg2005}; works in
\citealt{Biberauer2008,BibHolRobShee2010}, a.o.), which draws a much more
complex picture, leading to a proposal of \isi{parameter hierarchies}, able to
accommodate different parametric values. The representation in \figref{fig:ex:26.1},
still covering languages with some sort of agreement, includes such \gls{PNS}\is{null subject languages!partial null subject languages}
systems (cf.\ \citealt{HolShee2010}; \citealt[6]{Sheehan2014b}, a.o.).\largerpage[2]

Based on evidence coming from a number of languages of different families,
\citeauthor{RobHol2010} list, beside non-null subject languages,\footnote{We
    must keep in mind that non-null subject languages do not admit null
    subjects in neutral contexts. We do not ignore the fact that such
systems can exhibit null subjects, pragmatically identified in non-neutral
contexts (see, for instance, null first person subjects in \ili{English} diaries,
\citealt{Haegeman1990}).} the following types of \glspl{NSL}: consistent
\glspl{NSL}, such as \ili{Italian}, \ili{Greek} and \ili{Turkish}, with “rich”
inflection; null expletive\is{expletives} languages (also referred as \emph{semi}
\emph{pro-drop}), which do not allow referential NSs, among which we can find
\ili{German} and some varieties of \ili{Dutch} and many creoles, such as
\ili{Capeverdian}, \ili{Haitian}, and \ili{Jamaican}; radical null
subject\is{null subject languages!radical null subject languages}
languages (\emph{discourse pro-drop}), such as Chinese, \ili{Japanese} and
\ili{Thai}, with no agreement marker, which allow null subjects and objects in
appropriate discursive conditions; and finally, partial null subject languages,
including \ili{Finnish}, \ili{Hebrew}, \ili{Icelandic}, \ili{Russian},
\ili{Marathi} (a variety spoken in western India) and \ili{Brazilian
Portuguese}.  According to the authors, they constitute a more difficult type
to define because the languages under this label may show a very diverse range
of characteristics. \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}, on the contrary, instead
of creating a lexical expletive\is{expletives} like \ili{French}, shows a
competition between a null subject, and a prominent constituent moved to the
structural subject position, resembling constructions of discourse
configurational languages.

The proposal of \isi{parameter hierarchies} can be related to the notion of
\emph{micro}-parameters\is{parameters} \citep{Kayne1996}, which could explain small
differences among similar systems. According to \citet{Roberts2012}, each
formal feature defines a distinct parameter, and he also argues that parameters
move from “macro” to “micro” levels; thus, it would be natural to expect lower
layers in the hierarchy to become more marked, showing a more complex behaviour
than upper layers. The relevance of the parameter hierarchy\is{parameter
hierarchies} for acquisition\is{language acquisition}
should be the prediction that higher options would be preferred as they are
less marked; as more marked options appear in the primary data, the learner
moves to lower levels, until the definition of a parametric setting compatible
with the data is accomplished. The distinction between \emph{micro-} and
\emph{macro}-parameters\is{parameters} would not be, according to \citet[310]{Roberts2012},
part of \gls{UG}\is{Universal Grammar}, but a property that emerges as a result of the interaction of the
learner with the primary data and \gls{UG}\is{Universal Grammar}. These hierarchies also include some
predictions about diachronic changes: they should happen in the direction of
upper hierarchies, less marked, driven by functional pressures or linguistic
contact.

Finally, refining \figref{fig:ex:26.1}, \textcite{RobHol2010} proposed the \gls{NSP}
hierarchy in \figref{fig:ex:26.2}, suggesting that each functional head\is{functional items} defines its
parametric hierarchy.

\begin{figure}

                        ]

            {Are uφ-features fully specified on T?};
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

In sum, the attempt to accommodate different hierarchies, keeping the binary
values of each parameter,\is{parameters} is in itself evidence that it is not an easy
enterprise. As for the label \gls{NSP} in the interpretation it has in the
theory of principles and parameters today, it seems to include several
sub-types of languages, as argued by \citet{Biberauer2010}.  We will see that
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} exhibits a very peculiar behaviour in this
regard.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:26.2}

\subsection{Our aims}\label{sec:26.2.1}

The aim of this chapter is to revisit the comparative and diachronic studies of
linguists analysing \gls{BP} with regard to the \gls{NSP}, especially in view
of recent debates on the existence of the so-called \gls{PNS}\is{null subject languages!partial null subject languages} languages.  It is
a well known fact that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is losing the
properties of a prototypical \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages}, like \gls{EP}, with a rich
inflectional paradigm, but, as the change is very recent, there is still not a
consensus regarding the target of the change. Our question is whether
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} classifies as a \gls{PNS}\is{null subject languages!partial null subject languages} language like
\ili{Finnish}, \ili{Hebrew} or \ili{Marathi}, as was recently claimed in
\citet{Holmberg2010} and \citet{HolShee2010}. Methodologically, it is our
purpose to observe the overt and null subjects in real data so as to check
whether eventual optionality of null and overt pronominals can be attributed to
a grammatical competition from a diachronic perspective \citep{Kroch1994} or to
some licensing possibility within a single type of grammar, which is normally a
view taken by formal linguists analysing synchronic data. Using
acquisition\is{language acquisition} data (\citealt{Magalhaes2003} and
\citealt{Kato2011}), we will try to see how the Brazilian child selects their
grammar, and will follow the hypothesis that null referential subjects in the
Brazilian literate adult are not residues of the old grammar, but the result of
instruction through schooling.

Our  upcoming sections are organized as follows:  \Cref{sec:26.2.2}.
describes the \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} diachronic facts;
\Cref{sec:26.2.3} brings some considerations on acquisition\is{language acquisition} data;
\Cref{sec:26.3} contains a comparative analysis of \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} with four types of languages: \Cref{sec:26.3.1} with
\gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese}, a consistent \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages}, with rich Agr
inflection; \Cref{sec:26.3.2} with Japanese, a radical type,\is{null subject languages!radical null subject languages} or a discourse
configurational language type, with no Agr inflection; \Cref{sec:26.3.3}
with Finnish, a partial \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages}; \Cref{sec:26.3.4} with \ili{English}, a
[$-$NS] language; and \Cref{sec:26.3.5} with \ili{Icelandic}, the so-called
\emph{semi[NS]} language.

In the conclusions we will summarize the findings of the article, namely that
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} \isi{core grammar} is set to a [$-$NS] language
with referential subjects and to a [+NS] language with regard to
non-referential ones.  With regard to the literate Brazilians' \isi{E-language}
it will be shown to exhibit a competition with regard to referential subjects,
between   overt pronominal subjects  of the \ili{English} type, and  NSs, of
the radical type.\is{null subject languages!radical null subject languages}
With regard to non-referential subjects, the  literate adult maintains the same
types of NSs exhibited by the child.

\subsection{From Old Portuguese to Modern Brazilian
Portuguese}\label{sec:26.2.2}

As is well known among Romanists, \gls{OFr}\il{Old French} was “a sort of
V2\is{V2 word order} type of language”  (cf.\ (\ref{ex:26.3}a)) and also a
\gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages} (cf.\ \ref{ex:26.4}a)
(\citealt{Adams1987}, \citealt{Roberts1993}, a.o.). The latter property was
lost when \gls{OFr} lost this characteristic. According to \citet{Ribeiro1995},
\gls{OP} was also a \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages} and a “sort of
V2\is{V2 word order} type of language”\footnote{Cf.\ \textcite{Ribeiro1995} for
    OP and \textcite{TorresMoraes1993} for the Classic period.  Brazilian
    authors acknowledge that \ili{Romance} V2\is{V2 word order} is not exactly
    like the \ili{Germanic} V2\is{V2 word order}.  See also \citet{Kaiser1999}
    and \citet{Rinke2009} against Old Portuguese as a V2\is{V2 word order}
language.}  (cf.\ \ref{ex:26.3}b).  \gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese} retained
both properties, while \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} lost both the same way
\gls{OFr} did.

\ea%3
\label{ex:26.3}
\ea     \ili{Old French} V2\is{V2 word order}\\
    \gll    Eisint revindrent li mesage     en la ville.\\
            then  returned     the messenger to the town\\
    \glt    ‘Then the messenger returned to town.'
    \ex \ili{Old Portuguese} V2\is{V2 word order}\\
    \gll    Maravilhosas \textbf{son} estas cousas que co’ntas, padre\dots\\
            beautiful    are these things   that tell.\Ssg{}, father\\
    \glt    ‘Beautiful are the things that you tell us, father.’
    \z
\z

However, contrary to \ili{Germanic} languages, \gls{OFr} and OP could both exhibit
the V1 pattern (cf.\ \citealt{Kaiser1999}; \citealt{Ribeiro1995}), which in
French was restricted to VS, while in Portuguese it exhibited a null subject:

\ea\label{ex:26.4}
\ea     \ili{Old French} V1\\
    \gll    \textbf{Respundi} li evesches.\\
            answered the bishop\\
    \glt    \enquote*{The bishop answered.}
    \ex     \ili{Old Portuguese} V1\\
    \gll    \textbf{Quero} que m’o     digas        e     desejo mui   de coraçon a saber\dots{}\\
            want.\Fsg{} that  me=it tell.\Ssg{} and wish.\Fsg{} much of heart      to know\\
    \glt    \enquote*{I want you to tell me, and I  strongly wish to know...}
    \z
\z

If we take fronted Focus\is{focus} structures (FocusVS) as a diagnostic of
V2\is{V2 word order} structures in older periods of Portuguese, we can say that
these started to disappear in the 18th century in the \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} variety \parencite{KatoRibeiro2009}. On the other hand, the
optionality between NS and overt pronominal subjects in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} started to appear by the end of the 19th century
(\citealt{Tarallo1985,Duarte1993}). It is clear, therefore, that V2\is{V2 word
order} structures started to disappear one century before the NS began to
decline, suggesting that the two changes were independent in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}, contrary to what has been observed in
\ili{French}.

\begin{sloppypar}
A number of investigations on the morphosyntax of Brazilian Portuguese point to
the conclusion that variable phenomena have a very regular distribution in the
country. In fact, the polarization to which \citet{Lucchesi2009b} refers should
be related particularly to variation in the use of agreement markers. The
author, in a recent overview of sociolinguistic polarization in Brazil
\parencite{Lucchesi2015}, distinguishes those processes of variation and change
that reach all sectors of Brazilian society \emph{in the same direction} from
those processes which take opposite directions, setting apart high and middle
sectors from those at the base of the social pyramid. In spite of that, the
author recognizes a sort of “leveling” towards non-standard variants.
\end{sloppypar}

In fact, the alleged contrast may be valid when we consider the rural--urban
\emph{continuum}. Results for contemporary Brazilian morphosyntax show that,
when we take into account Brazilian Portuguese spoken in the cities, many
so-called “non-standard” variants have reached all sectors of society, in such
a way that it has become inappropriate to use the distinction
standard/non-standard to refer to spontaneous speech produced by people with
fewer or more years of school attendance. A possible explanation for that could
be in the successive migration flows from 1940, which would give rise to
intense contact among a wide range of linguistic varieties from all over the
country and might, thus, be among the causes of the implementation of
non-standard variants in the city, moving towards a new concept of the
“standard norm”.\footnote{The rural exodus, with data from the Brazilian
    Institute of Geography and Statistics, shows the deep transformation
related to those intense migration flows. Brazil, an eminently rural country in
1940, reached the year of 2000 with 80\% of its population in the cities.}  The
fact is that, as far as the cities are concerned, descriptions of
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} morphosyntax do not allow us to set a
boundary to separate varieties.

In an attempt to trace the expression of referential subjects,
\citeauthor{Duarte1993}’s (\citeyear{Duarte1993,Duarte2012}) diachronic
analysis shows the loss of the “\isi{avoid pronoun principle}” \citep{Chomsky1981} in
popular theatre plays, written in Rio de Janeiro in the 19th and the 20th
centuries. The results for referential subjects can be seen
in~\Cref{fig:26.1}.

The rates of null subjects across the periods analysed suggest three stages in
the process of change, which coincide with changes in the inflectional paradigm
triggered by apocope in the second person singular, a very common phenomenon,
and third person plural, a socially constrained phenomenon, as well as by two
important changes in the set of nominative\is{nominative case} pronouns, shown in
\Cref{tab:26.1}.\footnote{Considering that the first author was born in
    1815 and the fourth in 1884, we could assume that the change took place at
    the turn of the century. We are aware of the fact that tracing linguistic
    change over long periods of time implies using documents that do not
    capture the vernacular of their writers. Quoting
    \parencite[11]{Labov1994}, “historical linguistics can then be thought of
    as the art of making the best use of bad data”.}

    \emph{cantar} \enquote*{to sing} (adapted
from~\citealt{Duarte1993})}\label{tab:26.1}
\end{table}

The plays written in the first three periods, exhibit six  and sometimes
five different forms, with a syncretism, represented by the address forms
\emph{o(a) senhor(a)} \enquote*{the lord}, \enquote*{the lady} and \emph{Vossa
Mercê} \enquote*{Your Grace}, which all combine with third person unmarked form
for singular.  This is what we attest for European Portuguese. The reduction of
null subjects in the 1930s and the 1950s is triggered by the
\isi{grammaticalization}
of \emph{Vossa Mercê} as \emph{você}, which is fully inserted in the pronominal
system as second person reference, while the pronoun \emph{tu} is abandoned by
some authors.\footnote{For some reason to be investigated, the most popular
    authors of this type of “light” plays written in Rio de Janeiro made a
    choice in favor of \emph{você}. The city population has not abandoned the
use of \emph{tu} but it was more restricted to the suburban areas, with a
number of new textile industries, where people born in the city were
concentrated.} Those who insist in keeping \emph{tu} and \emph{você} in the
paradigm usually mix both forms to address the same person, not only in
nominative\is{nominative case} function but in accusative and dative\is{dative
    case} functions as well.\footnote{This is real evidence of the
    \isi{grammaticalization} of \emph{você}; the loss of courtesy, originally
    distinguishing \emph{você}, is kept in European Portuguese, which maintains
    the complementary distribution between \emph{tu}, for family and close
    friends, and \emph{você}, usually null, for other social relations.
    Explicit \emph{você} coming from a stranger is not well accepted by older
    Portuguese. See \citet{LopesBrocardo2016} with respect to current
\isi{grammaticalization} processes in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}.} This
change was further aggravated by the entry of \emph{a gente} (\enquote*{the
folks}, \enquote*{the people}, similar in meaning to \ili{French}
\enquote*{on}), in Paradigm 3, replacing first person plural \emph{nós} (we),
also requiring the unmarked third person singular agreement, due to its nominal
origin.

We have enough evidence from diachronic research, according to which both
processes started before the 19th century. With respect to \emph{a gente},
\citet{Lopes2003} shows that after a transitory period of ambiguity between a
nominal reading or its interpretation as a pronoun, it is at the end of the
19th century that its full implementation is attested in variation with the
conservative pronoun \emph{nós} (we), which has an exclusive ending
\tuple{\text{-mos}}.  With respect to \emph{você} (you), \citet{Lopes2003}
claims that its variation with \emph{tu} (you) in letters, very sporadic in the
19th century, enters the system slowly in the 20th century. A side  effect of
this pronominalization is attested in the mixture of oblique and possessive
pronouns of second and third persons in letters and plays written from the
1930s on. Today, \emph{você} (in variation with \emph{tu}) and \emph{a gente}
are preferred not only for definite reference but for generic reference as
well, in which case the former may or may not include the speaker and the
addressee, the latter must include the speaker.

Such changes have been the most significant trigger for the “impoverishment” of
BP’s paradigm. Differently from the variable use of \tuple{\text{-s}} and \tuple{\text{-m}}, related to a
phonological process (apocope) and constrained by social factors, there is no
variation in the use of the unmarked verb form with the new pronouns derived
from DPs. The consequence was the loss of the \emph{functional richness}
of the inflectional paradigm, in \citegen{Roberts1993} terms. For
\citet{Galves1993}, this reduction entails the loss of the semantic feature in
the category \emph{person.} Associated with the feature \emph{number}, the
paradigm was reduced to four possible combinations:\newpage

\ea%5
    \label{ex:26.5}\leavevmode\\[-1\baselineskip]%
    \begin{tabular}{lllll}
    $+$person & / & $-$plural & $>$ & \emph{-o} \\
    $+$person & / & $+$plural & $>$ & \emph{-mos} \\
    $-$person & / & $+$plural & $>$ & \emph{-m} \\
    $-$person & / & $-$plural & $>$ & \emph{-}$\varnothing$ \\
    \end{tabular}
\z

Such an \emph{impoverished} or \emph{weakened} paradigm would certainly affect
the identification of an empty category.

The empirical evidence of the late implementation of the two new pronouns does
not sustain the claim that it could actually be the case that the set of
pronouns changed as a consequence of the changes in the inflectional paradigm.
The cases of apocope shown in the chart above were certainly a consequence of
contact. However, additional evidence that African slaves and their descendants
did not reduce the verbal paradigm drastically comes from important written
documents produced by Africans, who learned Portuguese as a second language in
the State of Bahia. Such documents, written in the 19th
century – along the decades of 1830 and 1840 – consist of 53 Acts of the
\emph{Sociedade Protetora dos Desvalidos} (Protecting
Society of the Helpless), a fraternity founded by Africans to protect one
another, who kept minutes (memoranda) of their regular meetings, written by
five members. \citet{AlmeidaCarneiro2009} analysed the expression of pronominal
subjects and their results show the preference for null subjects with rates of
68\% for \Fsg{}, 89\% \Fpl{}, 89\% for \Tsg{}, and 93\% for \Tpl{}. The
paradigm used in the memoranda includes the pronoun \emph{nós} for \Fpl{}
reference, with the canonical inflection \tuple{\text{-mos}}. The cases of non-agreement are
restricted to the apocope of \Tpl{} inflection \tuple{\text{-m}}. This discursive tradition
does not favour the use of second person. All the constraints pointed out as
favoring null subjects, such as co-reference and non-animate antecedents, are
confirmed. The only oscillation attested in the data is related to individual
performances – only one of the five authors shows a low rate of null subjects
(33\%); the other four exhibit overall rates above 77\%.

The analyses of spoken Portuguese acquired by  African descendants are not
different from those obtained by Brazilians. \citegen{Lucchesi2009b} analysis
of the expression of subjects based on the vernacular speech of four isolated
rural Afro-Brazilian communities in the state of Bahia, with different
historical and socio-economic backgrounds, shows the same rates attested by
\citet{Duarte1995} for contemporary Portuguese spoken in the city of Rio de
Janeiro.

Returning to the results in \Cref{fig:26.1}, Duarte shows that the course
of change is different with respect to first and  second person on one hand and
to third person on the other. In the last quarter of the 20th century null
first and second person subjects reach a mean of 20\%. Third person, thanks to
the interaction of [+human] and [$-$human/$-$animate] referents, exhibits a slow
descending curve (see \citealt{CyrinoEtAl2000}). Such results would be
confirmed by \citegen{Duarte1995} analysis of spoken variety of Rio de Janeiro.
Referential pronominal subjects in root clauses are preferentially overt
\parencite{Duarte1995}.\footnote{In short answers we can have an apparent NS
    with third person, but we analyse this sort of structure as resulting from
    the fronting/focalization\is{focalisation} of the inflected verb eventually
    accompanied by its adjuncts, followed by the remnant \isi{movement} of the
    TP (cf.\ \citealt{Kato2016}).} Second person singular, which triggered and
    led the change, reveals 10\% of null subjects, usually pragmatically
    identified (\ref{ex:26.6}a); first person singular null subjects reach
    25\%, particularly when preceded by a functional category, such as a NegP,
    and AspP (\ref{ex:26.6}b):

\ea\label{ex:26.6}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
    \gll	$\varnothing$\tss{\Ssg} sabe {o que} é pinho de riga?\\
            {} know what is pine of riga\\
	\glt	‘Do you know what riga pine is?’
    \ex
	\gll	$\varnothing$\tss{\Fsg} não gosto de boxe.\\
            {} not like    of boxing\\
	\glt	‘I don´t like boxing’
    \z
\z

Third person subjects, as mentioned, are constrained by \isi{animacy} and structural
patterns. In root clauses \citet{Duarte1995} attested 36\% of null subjects,
usually identified by an antecedent bearing the same function in the adjacent
clause or by an antecedent with discursive prominence (cf.\
\citealt{BarbosaDuarteKato2005,KatoDuarte2014b}):

\ea%7
    \label{ex:26.7}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
	\gll	Ela\tss{i} gosta de cozinhar. $\varnothing$\tss{\Tsg\tss{i}} Aprende com as amigas.\\
    she likes of to.cook.      {}    learns    with the friends.\\

    \ex
	\gll	[ O meu irmão ]\tss{i}? $\varnothing$\tss{\Tsg\tss{i}}  Mudou pros Estados Unidos.\\
    {} the my brother?  {} {}     moved to.the United States.\\
	\glt	\enquote*{My brother? He's moved to the United States}
    \z
\z

In embedded clauses, co-reference still plays an important role
(\citealt{Modesto2000,FigueiredoSilva2000,DuarteSoaresdaSilva2016}, a.o.), with
a regular distribution between overt and null subjects. \citegen{Duarte1995}
data show 32\% of null subjects in this \isi{control} pattern with [+human] and 44\%
with [$-$animate] referents:\largerpage[-1]

\ea%8
    \label{ex:26.8}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
	\gll	mas \textbf{ele}\textbf{\tss{i}}  sentiu [ que
    $\varnothing$\tss{\Tsg\tss{i}}  era  o    único novo    ali,
    recém-casado \dots{}]\\
            but  he\tss{i}  felt   {} that {} was the only   young there, newly-married \\
	\glt	\enquote*{But he felt he was the only young guy there, newly married….}
    \ex

            {} That film\tss{i} {} touched many  people  when \hphantom{(}he  was ready\\
	\glt	\enquote*{That film touched many  people when it was shown}
    \z
\z

A null subject in a subordinate clause without co-reference with the subject of
the main clause is still attested if the verb of the main clause has an
epistemic verb. In such contexts, which have the antecedent in an
A$'$-position, overt subjects are also far more frequent:
(\citealt{MoreiradaSilva1983};
\citealt{FigueiredoSilva1996,FigueiredoSilva2000}, a.o.):

\ea\label{ex:26.9}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
    \gll	{}[ \textbf{O} \textbf{armazém} ]\tss{i} (\dots{}) {quer dizer,} \underline{acho} [ que $\varnothing$\tss{\Tsg\tss{i}} já é extinto ] né?\\
    {} the grocery-store {} {} {I mean} think.\Fsg{} {} that {}  already is extinct, {} see?\\
    \glt	\enquote*{The grocery store\dots{} I think it's now extinct}
\z

One significant difference between \ili{French} and Brazilian Portuguese noted
by \citet{Duarte1995} was the fact that, although the two \ili{Romance} languages
have lost null referential subjects, \ili{French} also lost the null expletive\is{expletives}
with the development of the expletives \emph{ce}  and \emph{il} while
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} retained it:

\ea%11
    \label{ex:26.11}
    \ea \ili{French}\\
    \gll    Il fait froid.\\
            it is  cold\\
    \ex \ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
    \gll    \textbf{$\varnothing$}\tss{\Expl} Faz frio./ $\varnothing$\tss{\Expl} Está frio.\\
            {} does cold {} is cold\\
    \z
\z

\ea%12
    \label{ex:26.12}
    \ea Middle \ili{French} (apud \citealt[151]{Roberts1993})\\
    \gll    {\textbf{Il} i} avoit bien .xxiiij.M.   archiers {a piet}\\
            there were about 24.000 archers marching\\
    \ex \ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
    \gll    $\varnothing$\tss{\Expl} havia {bem uns} 24.000    arqueiros {a pé}\\
            {}  was about 24.000 archers marching\\
    \z
\z

With the loss of the generic clitic \emph{se}, BP shows a NS in
generic constructions,\footnote{Since the arbitrary clitic \emph{se} is also
    extinct in speech, \gls{BP} also exhibits a null arbitrary subject
    \parencite{Rodrigues2004}, at very modest rates, attested in variation
with the use of a third person plural verb with a null or an overt pronoun
\emph{eles} (they).} while \ili{French} has the indefinite pronoun \emph{on}.

\ea%13
    \label{ex:26.13}
    \ea \ili{French}\\
        \textbf{On} ne voit plus de rémouleurs.
    \ex \ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
        $\varnothing$ Não vê mais amolador-de-faca.\\
        ‘One doesn’t see knife sharpeners any more.’
    \z
\z

However, in both languages, these constructions have nominative\is{nominative case} pronouns as
variants, largely preferred in \gls{BP}:

\ea\label{ex:26.14}
    \ea \ili{French}\\
        Vous / On ne voyez  plus de rémouleurs. Nous ne voyons plus de rémouleurs.
    \ex\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
        Você / A gente não vê  mais amolador-de-faca\\
        ‘You / we don't see knife sharpeners anymore.’
    \z
\z

There are even contexts, as illustrated in \eqref{ex:26.15}, where a null
generic is ungrammatical in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}:

\ea%15
    \label{ex:26.15}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
    \gll	Quando \textbf{a} \textbf{gente} / \textbf{você} / *$\varnothing$\textbf{\tss{\Genc}} é  menor, \textbf{a} \textbf{gente} / \textbf{você} não dá muito valor a essas coisas.\\
            when the people {} you {} {} are little, the people {} you not  give much value to these things\\
	\glt	\enquote*{When we /you are young, we / you do not value such things}
\z

Summarizing, our empirical analysis reveals that null referential subjects are
much less frequent than overt pronominals. Furthermore, the null generic
subject is not the most productive strategy to represent this type of
indeterminate subject; in addition, recent research does not show any sign of
increasing use of it among younger generations (see~\citealt{MarinsEtAlta}).
This might support the hypothesis that null subjects in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} could be residual cases still reflecting the replaced null subject
system, as far as referential (definite and indeterminate -- either arbitrary
or generic) uses are concerned. We will return to this matter in the following
section.

\section{Core grammar and I-language}\label{sec:26.2.3}

The theory of \glsunset{UG}\gls{UG}\is{Universal Grammar} tries to account for the acquisition\is{language acquisition} of
\emph{core} grammars through parameter\is{parameters} setting in a context of poverty of
stimulus \citep{Chomsky1986}, which can be understood partly as data containing
competing forms due to different values of the same parameter\is{parameters} coexisting in the
input that children receive. This is exactly the situation that a child faces
when there is a recent change or a change in progress as shown by the
well-studied case of the null subject (NS) in Brazilian Portuguese (BP).

As we saw above, in the \isi{I-language} of most literate Brazilian adults, a range
of referential NSs are possible, competing with the innovative pronominal
subjects. It is the case of the optionality of NSs and pronouns in complement
clauses as in example \REF{ex:15/2}:

\ea%15
    \label{ex:15/2}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
	\gll	O Pedr\textbf{o}\tss{i} disse que (\textbf{ele}\tss{i}) fala bem     espanhol.\\
            the Peter said that \hphantom{(}he speaks well  Spanish\\
	\glt	\enquote*{Peter said that  he speaks Spanish well.}
\z

Assuming, with \citet{Kato2011},\footnote{See also \citeauthor{Dresher1999}'s
(\citeyear{Dresher1999}, a.o.) theory according to which children do not reset
parameters.\is{parameters}} that \emph{core} grammars do not admit morphological “doublets”,
and that children have only the innovative variant, we will see that pre-school
children do not have pronouns competing with referential null subjects as in
the above context. \citeauthor{Kato2011} borrows data from
\textcite{Magalhaes2003}, who argues that referential NSs in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} are learned in school, where old forms are
provided through instruction.\largerpage[1]

\begin{table}[htpb]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lXXX}
    \lsptoprule
                         & Pre-school & 3rd/4th grades & 7th/8th grades\\
    \midrule
    Pronominal subjects & 97.89\%    & 78.0\%         & 50.38\%\\
    Null subjects       & 2.11\%     & 22.0\%         & 49.62\%\\

    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Pronominal and null subjects in complement clauses (adapted
    from~\citealt{Magalhaes2003})}\label{tab:26.2}
\end{table}

When the child masters complex clauses in pre-school, the NS is still almost
nonexistent in his/her oral production of complement clauses. NSs start to
increase very quickly in their written performance, achieving the status of an
equal variant of the overt pronoun at the end of 8th
grade.\footnote{\citet{KatoEtAl2009} arrive at a similar conclusion
    with regard to null objects,\is{null objects} but in the opposite direction. Children have
    only null objects\is{null objects} in their \isi{core grammar}, and acquire
    the lost third person
clitic at school.}

Several studies try to analyse the nature of the NS in such constructions,
where optionality is found in the adult’s \isi{E-language}, but what we are actually
studying is a variant learned at school, and one may ask whether these NSs are
an object of \gls{UG}. We will return to this problem in the following
sections.

The conclusion is that the only type of null subject licensed in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} \emph{core} grammar are the non-referential
NSs, namely the null expletive\is{expletives} and the generic subjects without the clitic
\emph{se}, as they are attested during language acquisition\is{language acquisition}.

\ea%16
    \label{ex:26.16}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea \textcite{Simoes2000}\\

    \gll    $\varnothing$\tss{\Genc} pode chupar o dedo?\\
            {} can  suck the finger\\
    \z
\z

As for the \isi{E-language} exhibited by the literate adult, it will be shown that
the non-referential null subjects are the same as those of the Brazilian child,
but the null referential ones are in variation with the overt pronominal ones.

\section{Comparing the NS in BP with different types of
languages}\label{sec:26.3}

\subsection{BP vs.\ EP, a consistent NS language}\label{sec:26.3.1}

\citet{CarSta1994} distinguish three types of pronouns: strong, weak and
clitic.  Following \citet{Kato1999} we will make an initial split between
strong and weak forms, and will assume that weak pronominals can be one of
three types: i) free pronouns, like in \ili{English}, ii) \isi{clitics} as in
Trentino, a Northern \ili{Italian} dialect or iii) agreement affixes, or
pronominal Agr as in \ili{Italian} and \gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese} (cf.\
Fig 2). The weak pronominals are Agreement affixes in the so-called consistent
\emph{pro-drop} languages. All languages, on the other hand, have strong
pronouns, which exhibit a “default” case
(\citealt{Kato2000,Schutze2001}).\footnote{Moreover, strong pronouns are always
    deictic, or referential, while weak pronouns can be deictic or
    referentially dependent.  Strong pronouns are always [+human] while weak
pronouns can be [+human] or [$-$human].}

\citegen{Salvi1997} conclusions on what happened in the beginning of \ili{Romance}
seem to partially support what is being proposed here. Studying the changes
from \ili{Latin} to Old \ili{Romance} and from Old \ili{Romance} to \ili{French} and the Northern
\ili{Italian} dialects, he concludes that: (a) \ili{Latin} had only one form of
nominative pronouns, which, he assumes, were used as strong or weak pronouns,
(b) in Old \ili{Romance} pronominal anaphora was not obligatory since subject \isi{clitics}
did not exist; (c) in \ili{French} and in some \ili{Italian} dialects zero
anaphora  (NS) ceases to exist when subject \isi{clitics} appear (see also
\citealt{Roberts1993}).

For \citet{Kato1999},\footnote{See also similar views in
\citet{Barbosa1995,AleAna1998,OrdonezTrevino1999}.} pronominal Agr, understood
as the \isi{grammaticalization}/in\-cor\-poration of personal pronouns in verbal
Inflection, is claimed to be in crosslinguistic complementary distribution with
weak pronouns and subject \isi{clitics}. Thus, the loss of one implies the
introduction of the other type of weak pronouns.\footnote{Studying the loss of
    NSs in \ili{Dominican Spanish} and \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese},
\textcite[28]{Camacho2016} proposes, in line with \citet{Kato1999}, that the
change has to do with “modification in the lexical entries for inflection”,
namely the introduction of weak pronouns.}

In \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} the great innovation was the introduction
of an English-like paradigm of weak pronouns partially homophonous with the
strong ones \parencite{Nunes1990,Kato1999} in place of the old pronominal Agr
system.\footnote{In written language the new paradigm is represented as
homophonous to the strong pronouns.}

\ea\label{ex:26.17}\leavevmode\\[-1\baselineskip]
    \begin{tabular}{llll}

    VOCÊ (you) & [cê      & VOCÊS (you) & [cêis] \\
    ELE (he)   & [ele/ei] & ELES (they) & [eles/eis] \\
    \end{tabular}
\z\largerpage

Pronominal Agr is syntactically defined by \citet{Kato1999} as a D-category
that appears in the numeration as an independent item from the verb, being
first merged as an external argument of \emph{v}, with interpretable
φ-features.\footnote{\citegen{Kato1999} analysis above eliminated \emph{pro},
    and its problems in a Minimalist frame: (a) the position of \emph{pro}
    ceases to be a problem, (b) its presence in the numeration is eliminated
    and (c) it will give a coherent explanation on why there is free inversion
    since it will be moving a maximal projection. Brazilian Portuguese, on the
other hand, cannot move T’, the reason why it lost free inversion.}  There is
no Spec of T/INFL projected, as the pronominal agreement satisfies the
\glsunset{EPP}\gls{EPP} morphologically. In \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}
with Agr no longer pronominal, free weak pronouns are introduced, and Spec of
T/INFL has to be projected. In \gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese}, on the other
hand, pronominal Agr remained and, therefore, no weak free pronouns were
created.

Strong pronouns are in a higher projection than weak pronouns. This higher
projection can be ΣP, as in \citet{Martins1994}, or the SubjP in
\citet{Cardinaletti:2004a}. When the pronoun is overt in \gls{NSL}s, it always
has an emphatic or contrastive interpretation. If a non-NS language has an
overt pronoun, the sentence exhibits subject doubling, as in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} (cf.\ the examples in \eqref{ex:26.18},
apud \citealt{Kato2012}). But in either case, strong pronouns have a “default”
case and are always referential and  [+animate] (\citealt{Kato1999},
\citealt{Schutze2001}).

Taking into consideration that the referential NS of the literate Brazilian
adult has been acquired through schooling, we can bring some interesting
results from \citeauthor{BarbosaDuarteKato2005}’s study as to what extent
instruction recovers the “\isi{avoid pronoun principle}”, which seems to rule the
speakers of a consistent \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages}.
\Cref{fig:26.2} shows null subjects in spoken \gls{EP}\il{European
Portuguese} and \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}.

Despite the fact that schools in Brazil try to
provide the students with the old NS grammar, Brazilians produce a much higher
proportion of overt pronouns than Portuguese speakers, following the same
hierarchy (see examples (\ref{ex:26.6}--\ref{ex:26.9}) in
\Cref{sec:26.2.2}). As we mentioned in \Cref{sec:26.2.2}, this has
been related to (a) the neutralization of \emph{tu} and \emph{você} (second PS)
for second person reference, (b) the replacement of \emph{vós} by \emph{vocês}
(second PP), and (c) the introduction of \emph{a} \emph{gente}  in competition
with \emph{nós}, which reduced the inflectional paradigm (see
\tabref{tab:26.1}), requiring the overt pronoun for identification
reasons.\footnote{Most regions of the country that keep the pronoun \emph{tu}
    combine it, in colloquial speech, with the same unmarked third person verb
    form used with \emph{você} (\emph{tu}/\emph{você} \emph{fala} – you speak).
    Evidence for the neutralization of both pronouns is in the fact that they
    are used without any distinction as regards courtesy, contrary to what
happens in Portugal.}

As for qualitative distinctions \citeauthor{BarbosaDuarteKato2005}
(\citeyear[19]{BarbosaDuarteKato2005}, BDK) listed the following observations:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item A significant difference between the two varieties is in the
fact that overt pronouns in \gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese} are almost
invariably [+animate], which shows that they are generally strong pronouns,
while in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} they can be [+animate] or
[$-$animate], indicating that they can be strong or weak.

\ea\label{ex:26.19}
    \ea\ili{European Portuguese}\\
	\gll	Os miúdos  vão pra     escola e     ela vai    pro      escritório.\\

	\glt	\enquote*{I think that  a task should have to start from here.}
    \z
\z

\item The \isi{control} relation between the antecedent and the null
subject is the most favourable context for NSs in both varieties, even though
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} prefers overt subjects; in
\gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese}, on the other hand, a null subject is
categorical, as in (\ref{ex:26.20}), the exceptional cases having to do with
emphatic/contrastive strong ones.\largerpage[-1]

\ea%20
    \label{ex:26.20}\ili{European Portuguese}\\
	\gll	Ela\tss{i} disse logo que \textbf{$\varnothing$}\tss{i} tava em
    férias e que \textbf{$\varnothing$}\tss{i} morava ali {ao pé} do liceu.\\

            near of.the liceum\\
	\glt	\enquote*{She soon said that she was on vacation and that she lived there near the school.}
\z

\item The real variation domain of null and expressed subjects in
both varieties is where no \isi{control} relation obtains. It seems to be correlated
with a functional factor, namely topic maintenance, which favours the NS, vs.
topic shift, favouring overt pronouns (cf.\ also \citealt{DeOliveira2000} and
\citealt{Marins2009} with respect to Italian). However, a consistent NSL will
prefer a null subject even in anaphoric contexts.

\ea%21
    \label{ex:26.21}\ili{European Portuguese}
    \ea
	\gll	Quando eu estava a trabalhar com ele\tss{i} \textbf{$\varnothing$}\tss{i} nunca me     queria ver na cozinha\\

	\glt	\enquote*{When I was at work with him, he never wanted to see me in the kitchen.}

			seems   that in.a   trip of.her to.the England,    she made with that  the queen ordered our products\\
	\glt	\enquote*{It seems that in one of her trips to England she made the queen order our products.}
    \z
\z
\end{enumerate}

To account for the finding that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} still
licenses NSs, as opposed to a language like \ili{English}, we have had two
lines of explanation:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item they result from the fact that we have a change in progress,
with two grammars in competition (\citealt{Duarte1993,Duarte1995};
\citealt{Kato2000}), the NSs being residual occurrences of the  same NS of the
old grammar;

\item the NS in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is not a
pronominal Agr,  but (b1) a variable bound by a quantifier
\parencite{NegraoMuller1996}; (b2) a variable or an anaphor
\parencite{FigueiredoSilva2000}; (b3) a variable bound by a Topic, the subject
in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} being in A$'$-position \citep{Modesto2000};
(b4) the trace of A-movement
\parencite{Ferreira2004,Rodrigues2004,MartinsNunes2010}.
\end{enumerate}

However, according to the data in \textcite{BarbosaDuarteKato2005} and in
\citet{Kato2009}, the theories in (b) do not explain the optionality in real
data, namely the presence of overt pronouns, where the NS would be the only
option.

Working with the \isi{raising} phenomenon in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese},
\citet{MartinsNunes2005} show that standard raising, very rare in spoken
\gls{BP}, gave rise to a structure such as (\ref{ex:26.25}a), initially
treated by the authors as a case of hyper-raising, explained by the possibility
of an optional defective T in the embedded clause, incapable of checking the
features of a raised subject. However, the optionality of a null or overt
pronoun from the embedded clause led \textcite{MartinsNunes2010} to propose
that what raises to SpecTP of the main clause is a dislocated topic inside
the embedded clause, and both the raised constituent and the subject of the
embedded clause can check the features properly. According to
\citeauthor{MartinsNunes2010}, in view of the input of literate speakers,
children can acquire, much later along with standard raising, the structure in
(\ref{ex:26.25}b), another possibility in European Portuguese, which exhibits a
dislocated topic, and the problem of case checking no longer applies:

\ea%25
    \label{ex:26.25}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
    \gll	[\tss{CP}~[ Os vizinhos {]\tss{i}} parec\textbf{em} [ que [~\emph{t}~]\tss{i} (eles)\tss{i} comprar\textbf{am} um carro ].\\

	\glt	\enquote*{The neighbours seem to have bought a car.}
    \z
\z

As in \citet{MartinsNunes2010} and \citet{Kato2011}, the hypothesis that we
will be considering is that the Brazilian child has set the \gls{NSP} to its
negative value, and that the referential NSs in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} adult data result from the imperfect learning of a “second
grammar”.

\subsection{BP vs.\ Japanese, a radical NS language}\label{sec:26.3.2}\largerpage

A radical\is{null subject languages!radical null subject languages} null subject (NS) language has been defined as one without rich
agreement, like, for instance, Chinese and \ili{Japanese}, also referred
to as \emph{discourse configurational} (DC) languages
\parencite{EKiss1995,Miyagawa2010} or Topic-prominent languages
\parencite{LiThompson1976}.\footnote{The first author of the paper is a speaker
of Japanese as L1, and of \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} as L2, but more
fluent in the latter.} Three reasons lead Brazilian linguists to hypothesize
that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is changing towards a DC type of
language:\footnote{See the first  proposals in \citet{Pontes1987} and
    \citet{Kato1989}.  Actually they propose that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} is a Topic and Subject prominent language in
\citegen{LiThompson1976} terminology.   More recently, see
\citet{NegraoViotti2000,Modesto2008} with a similar view.} (a)
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} lost rich agreement,  (b) like other DC type
of language, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} not only has NSs, but also null
objects and bare nouns, and (c) like other DC types of language,
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} does not dispose of lexical expletives, in
accordance with \citegen{LiThompson1976} assumption for Topic prominent
languages.\footnote{\textcite{KatoDuarte2014a} proposed the \isi{movement} of an
    internal constituent to SpecTP in \gls{BP}, instead of the direct merging
    of the null expletive\is{expletives} (cf.\ \citealt{Chomsky2004}). But, in later work,
\textcite{KatoDuarte2014b} show that the two resulting constructions co-exist,
one in categorical constructions and the other in the thetic one.}

With existential sentences, what we have in Japanese, instead of the expletive\is{expletives},
is the morpheme  \emph{-ga} marking the subject. For the locative raised ones,
we have \emph{-wa}, the topic marker.  A sentence with \emph{-ga} is
interpreted as a thetic, or a presentational, sentence, while a sentence with
\emph{-wa} is interpreted as a categorical (or predicational) one.\footnote{See
    \citet{Kuroda1972} for this terminology.  Existential sentences are typical
    thetic sentences. In \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} the subject is a
null expletive\is{expletives} when it is a thetic sentence, but if the locative raises to
subject position it is a categorical sentence like sentences with \emph{-wa} in
Japanese.}

Weather constructions in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} have (a) the verb
denoting the climatic event with a null expletive\is{expletives} as the subject
(cf.\ (\ref{ex:26.28}a)), or  (b) like Japanese, the subject denoting  the
event with a general verb of motion \emph{cair} \enquote*{fall} as in
(\ref{ex:26.28}b).  The third possibility is locative \isi{raising} to the
subject position (\ref{ex:26.28}c).  Moreover, in this case the sentence is
categorical and the subject triggers agreement in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese}, but not in Japanese.

But besides the existential and the weather verb sentences,
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} has another NS similar to Japanese, namely
the null generic and arbitrary sentences.

\ea%30
    \label{ex:26.30}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
	\gll	$\varnothing$ conserta sapato.\\

    \ex

            {}  shoes-\Acc{}   repair-do\\
	\glt	\enquote*{One repairs shoes.}
    \z
\z

In order to analyse the NS of generic and arbitrary sentences, \citet{Kato2000}
made use of PRO for finite contexts, adapting \citegen{Huang1989} idea of
\emph{generalized \isi{control} theory}.  We can support this view as, with the
deterioration of inflection, finite sentences tend to behave as infinitive or
gerundive clauses. Kato also assumes that PRO is the strong null third person
pronoun and we are assuming with \citet{Tomioka2003} that the weak pronoun in
Japanese is a null noun. We would have the following representation in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} for a non-referential generic sentence with
the NS.  The nominal [\tss{NP} $\varnothing$] in \eqref{ex:26.31} would
correspond to the \ili{English} nominal \emph{one}, or the \ili{French}
\emph{on.}

\ea%31
    \label{ex:26.31}
    {}[ PRO\tss{i} [ [\tss{NP} $\varnothing$ ]\tss{i} conserta sapato ]]
\z

Just like with existentials, we can have \isi{raising} of a locative, both in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}  and Japanese, with the same categorical
reading

\ea%36
    \label{ex:26.36bp}
    \ea\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}\\
        Aqui conserta sapato.

        ‘Here one repairs shoes.’

This parallel behaviour between agreement and a Discourse feature can be
explained in terms of \citet{HolNik2002}, for whom Topic\is{topic} and
Focus\is{focus} are
formal features, equivalent to \is{phi-features@φ-features}φ-features. \citegen{Miyagawa2010} implements
this idea in an interesting way to derive agreement languages vs.\ discourse
configurational languages.  In his analysis, discourse features forces \isi{movement}
in the same fashion as does agreement. In the spirit of
\citeauthor{Chomsky2007}’s (\citeyear{Chomsky2007,Chomsky2008})
proposal of merging \is{phi-features@φ-features}φ-features in C, with their subsequent percolation to
T,\footnote{Miyagawa uses φ-probes, instead of \is{phi-features@φ-features}φ-features.} Miyagawa’s proposal
is to merge the discourse-features (\is{delta-features@δ-features}δ-features) in C as an  alternative  to the
φ{}-features, which would also trigger
movement.\footnote{\textcite{NavesEtAl2013} provide the first attempt to analyse
    \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} using Miyagawa’s theory.  Though  it is
    similar in approach, the purpose of the present analysis  is to compare
Japanese and \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} using the same theoretical
frame.} He admits, moreover, that there are also mixed types of languages,
such as \ili{Turkish}, which can percolate both types of features.

We may say that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is this mixed kind of
language as \isi{raising} is triggered if the DP is a topic, but, at the same time, T
inherits agreement features, as can be seen in (\ref{ex:26.28}c).

\subsection{BP: A PNS language?}\label{sec:26.3.3}

This section brings some support to Biberauer’s comment, presented at the
beginning of this chapter, namely to the fact that this group seems
to include several sub-types of languages.

According to \citegen{HolNik2002} well-known article on Finnish, this language
has the following properties related to the subject position: (a) it has a rich
agreement system; (b) but, contrary to consistent \gls{NSL}s, the NS is
\emph{optional} (even though extremely rare in speech) with first and second
persons (36a,b) while third person subjects, animate or inanimate, must be
\emph{overt} in matrix clauses (\ref{ex:26.36}c), with null subjects
allowed only in embedded clauses under the requirement that they be bound by
the closest controller (see similar examples for \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} in \eqref{ex:26.8} and \eqref{ex:26.9} in
\Cref{sec:26.2.2}); (c) expletives can be optional with weather-verbs and
extraposed sentences (\ref{ex:26.36}d); (d) but are obligatory with
existential type of predicates  (\ref{ex:26.36}e), and (e) it is a topic
prominent language in the sense that the \gls{EPP} can be satisfied only by
referential categories, such as temporal adverbials and locatives or even DPs,
apparently to avoid V1 (\ref{ex:26.36}e), (\ref{ex:26.37}a,b).


\ea%36
    \label{ex:26.36}\ili{Finnish}
    \ea
	\gll    (Minä) ol-i-n       väsynyt.\\
            \hphantom{(}I        be-\Pst-\Fsg{}   tired\\
    \ex
    \gll    (Sinä) ol-i-t           väsynyt.\\
            \hphantom{(}thou be-\Pst-\Ssg{}    tired\\
    \ex \gll    Hän ol-i väsynyt.\\
    {he / she} be-\Pst{}.\Tsg{} tired\\
    \ex
    \gll    Nyt (se) taas sataa.\\
    now \hphantom{(}it again rains\\
    \ex
    \gll	Sitä leikkii lapsia kadulla.\\

    \ex
	\gll	Tanään   leikkii  lapsia     kadulla.\\

    \z
\z

\citet{HolmbergNayuduSheehan2009} and \citet{HolShee2010} account for the data
above assuming that (a) the NSs in \gls{PNS}\is{null subject languages!partial
    null subject languages} languages are full pronouns, deleted at
    \glsunset{PF}\gls{PF},\footnote{The authors who propose this
        \gls{PNS}\is{null subject languages!partial null subject languages}
        type of language follow \citegen{Perlmutter1971} old thesis of NSs as
        deleted pronouns.  See also \citet{Roberts2010c} with an analysis of
        NSs along the same lines.} and (b) that the non-referential cases can
        be explained as the lack of a D-feature in T.\footnote{A different
            analysis is provided by \citet{Barbosa2013}, who follows
            \citet{Tomioka2003}. The NS in discourse pro-drop languages for the
        author is a null NP anaphora.}

Moreover, according to the authors, subjects and non-subject topics occupy the
same position in Finnish: SpecFP. In generic sentences the expletive\is{expletives}
\emph{sitä}, which is not nominative\is{nominative case}, also occupies SpecFP.

\ea%38
    \label{ex:26.38}\ili{Finnish}\\
	\gll	Sitä väsyy          nykyään helpommin kuin ennen.\\
            \Expl{} gets-tired  nowadays easier       than before\\
	\glt	\enquote*{One gets tired these days easier than before.}
\z

\citet{Holmberg2005} later includes generic subjects in the list where the
subject can be null:

\ea%39
\label{ex:26.39}\ili{Finnish}\\
	\gll	Täällä  ei saa polttaa\\
			here   not may smoke\\
	\glt	\enquote*{One can't smoke here.}
\z

As was shown in \Cref{sec:26.3.1}, the weakened \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} agreement morphemes have developed into a system of weak free
pronouns, but without developing a lexical expletive\is{expletives}. This is the opposite of
Finnish, with its rich pronominal agreement paradigm, but which, surprisingly,
displays a lexical expletive\is{expletives}, a property of [$-$NS] languages, except that it is
not nominative\is{nominative case}.   The creation of weak pronouns in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
    Portuguese}, like in \ili{French}, also explains why \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} null generic subjects occur in variation with overt weak pronouns,
which may include either the speaker, \emph{a gente} \enquote*{the people} (=
\enquote*{we folks}) or the speaker, \emph{você} \enquote*{you}, both with
third person agreement.  Although the null generic subject in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} (\ref{ex:26.39}a) shares characteristics of
the Japanese null noun, in the latter, the generic, or indefinite, subject
cannot be encoded by weak pronouns as in (\ref{ex:26.40}b,c).  The same
seems to be the case in Finnish, as according to \citet[540]{Holmberg2005}:
“\dots, in partial null-subject languages generic pronouns can, and must, be
null”.

\ea%40
    \label{ex:26.40}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
	\gll	\textbf{$\varnothing$}  Pode comer a pizza agora.\\
    {} can eat     the pizza now\\
    \ex
	\gll	\textbf{Você} pode comer a pizza agora\\
			you can     eat the pizza  now\\
    \ex
	\gll	\textbf{A gente} pode comer a pizza agora.\\
			we-folks can eat      the pizza now\\
	\glt	\enquote*{One can eat the pizza now.}
    \z
\z

As for referential NSs, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} differs significantly
from \ili{Finnish} in that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} null second person is
almost completely absent, restricted to questions, whose subject is
pragmatically identified. First person null subjects are also on the way to
obsolescence, in matrix and in embedded clauses. Third person subjects, as
illustrated in \Cref{sec:26.2.2}, are allowed but not frequent either in
matrix or in embedded clauses, obeying the same requirement of an accessible
prominent antecedent (see \citealt{KatoDuarte2014a,KatoDuarte2014b}).

\Cref{sec:26.3.2} revealed, additionally, that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} is a sort of discourse configurational language. There is a
difference, however, between topic sentences in \ili{Finnish} and topic ones in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}. In the latter the topic--subjects are in
A-position, triggering agreement, while in the former, it is proposed to be
located in SpecFP.\is{agreement!topic agreement}

The Brazilian system also allows merging of a non-argument in existentials,
instead of the null expletive\is{expletives}, usually a demonstrative or the very pronoun
\emph{você}, which, besides its definite second person reference, has developed
a generic one, to finally appear inserted in an existential or any impersonal
sentence. This brings support to \citegen{AvelarGalves2011} claim that SpecTP
in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is φ-in\-de\-pen\-dent, or we can say,
following \citet{Miyagawa2010}, that T in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} can
inherit both φ- and \is{delta-features@δ-features}δ-features.\is{phi-features@φ-features}

\ea%40
    \label{ex:26.40bp}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
    \gll	\textbf{$\varnothing$\tss{\Expl}} era {em torno de}  mil pessoas.\\
			{} was  around {a thousand} people\\
    \ex
    \gll	{\textbf{Aquilo} / \textbf{isso}} era  {em torno de} mil pessoas.\\
			that was around {a thousand} people\\
	\glt	\enquote*{It was around a thousand people}

			you   not have more commerce in.the center of.the city\\
	\glt	\enquote*{There is no commerce downtown anymore}
    \z
\z

Summarizing, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} has been included among
\gls{PNS} languages by \citet{HolShee2010}. However, if only its spoken
vernacular language is taken into consideration, it becomes clear that its
dissimilarities with other \gls{PNS}\is{null subject languages!partial null subject languages} languages are greater than  its
similarities.

\subsection{BP vs.\ English, a [$-$NS] language}\label{sec:26.3.4}

We have seen in \Cref{sec:26.2} that the deterioration of verbal pronominal
affixes led \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} to replace them with free weak
pronouns and quasi-homophonous strong ones, but without a “default”
case. The examples below show the substantial replacement of NSs with overt
pronouns in one century \parencite{Duarte1993,Duarte2012}.\newpage

\ea%42
    \label{ex:26.42}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea     Quando \textbf{$\varnothing$\tss{\Fsg}} te vi pela

    \textbf{$\varnothing$\tss{\Ssg}} eras viúva e rica.
    \textbf{$\varnothing$\tss{\Fsg}} Amei-te por simpatia.  (Martins
    Pena, 1845)\\ ‘When (I) saw you for the first time, (I) didn’t know that
    (you) were a widow and rich’
    \ex     Se \textbf{eu} ficasse aqui \textbf{eu} ia querer ser a madrinha.
    (M.\ Falabella, 1992)\\ ‘If  I   stayed here  I would want to be the
    god-mother.’

			pro céu \dots{} (M. Falabella, 1992) \\
	        \enquote*{You don't understand my heart because  you are always looking at-the sky.}
    \z
\z

Moreover, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} underwent two changes with regard
to generic “\emph{se}” constructions seen above:  first it lost the clitic
“\emph{se}” resulting in the NS; second, as seen above, impersonal
\emph{se} is being preferably replaced by the personal form with
\emph{você} or \emph{a gente} (see~\Cref{fig:26.3}).

\end{figure}

Further evidence that \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} has become a [$-$NS]
language is in the fact that subject doubling (or \isi{left dislocation}) is
frequent in daily speech.\footnote{See \citet{Britto2000}, for whom
    the loss of VS order in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} made thetic
sentences exhibit the SV order, and the categorical sentence exhibit a Left
Dislocation structure.}\largerpage[2]

\ea%45
    \label{ex:26.45}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea Eu acho que \textbf{um} \textbf{trabalho}\textbf{\tss{i}}, \textbf{ele}\textbf{\tss{i}} teria que começar por ai.\\
    \enquote*{I think that a work it would have to start from there.}
    \ex \dots{} é porque    existe uma filosofia que \textbf{o preço}\textbf{\tss{i}}\textbf{ele}\textbf{\tss{i}} tem uma paridade.\\
    \enquote*{(It)’s because (there) exists a belief     that the price (it) has a parity.}
    \z
\z

Though doubling is possible in \gls{NSL}s like \ili{Spanish}, it is inaudible because
the subject is the pronominal agreement. \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}, on
the other hand, pairs up with  \ili{English}, a non-NS language, with null
non-referential subjects, and their doubling is similar.\largerpage

\ea%46
    \label{ex:26.46}
    \ea \textbf{YO\tss{i}},  com-\textbf{o}\tss{i}  pizza.
    \ex \textbf{ME}\tss{i}, \textbf{I} eat  pizza.
    \ex \textbf{EU}, [\textbf{ô}] como pizza.
    \z
\z

\citet{Roberts1993b} shows that, when \ili{French} became a [$-$]NS language, it
also started having subject doubling. A further subsequent change in
\ili{French} was that the “default” case of its strong pronouns changed from
nominative to dative\is{dative case}. \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} retained the same case
of the old strong pronouns.

\ea%47
    \label{ex:26.47}\ili{French}
    \ea Renars respond: \textbf{Jou, je} n’irai.
    \ex Et \textbf{jou je} cuit.
    \ex \textbf{Moi}, je le cuit.
    \z
\z

Another similarity to [$-$]NS languages is present in complement contexts. When
the embedded subject is a pronoun, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is exactly
like \ili{English} (EN) in anaphoric interpretation. However, its NS is
distinct in interpretation from the NS in \gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese}, a
prototypical \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages}, and similar to the NS in
Japanese, a radical type.\is{null subject languages!radical null subject
languages}

\ea%48
    \label{ex:26.48}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese} = \ili{English}
    \ea {}[ John’s\tss{i} father\tss{k} ]\tss{j} said that he\tss{i/k/j} was stupid.

\z

Recall that (\ref{ex:26.48}b) is the form that a pre-school child would
produce, while \eqref{ex:26.49} is the one that may be produced  by some
Brazilians after schooling in formal settings.

\subsection{BP vs.\ Icelandic, a semi [$-$NS] language}\label{sec:26.3.5}

Up to now, we have been considering three types of \gls{NSL}s: the consistent,
like \gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese}, the radical\is{null subject languages!radical null subject languages} like \ili{Japanese}, and the
partial \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages} like Finnish. We also saw a prototypical example of a [$-$NS]
language, namely \ili{English}.

We have now to consider the \emph{semi pro-drop type}, like \ili{German},
namely languages that were defined as having only null expletives.
\citet{Biberauer2010} prefers to call these languages \emph{semi null subject
(semi-NS) languages.} The author considers that \emph{semi NSLs} deserve a
further division between languages like \ili{German} and \ili{Dutch}, which
have only true null expletives,\is{expletives} and the \ili{Icelandic} and \ili{Yiddish} type, which also
dispose of the NS with weather verbs (cf.\ also \citealt{Huang2000}).

If we consider that referential NSs in Brazilian \isi{core grammar} are [–NS]
and that it disposes of null expletives, we might propose that
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is actually a \textit{semi [$-$NS]}
language, as was defended in \citet{Saab2016}, with both
\emph{quasi}-argumental  (weather verbs) and true expletive\is{expletives} NSs.

What we should point out, however, is the fact that in both types of
\emph{semi NS} language, the expletive\is{expletives} can be overt or
null \citep{Biberauer2010}, while in Brazil there are no overt expletives, like
in consistent \gls{NSL}s.

\ea%50
    \label{ex:26.50ice}\ili{Icelandic}
    \ea Overt expletive\is{expletives}\\
    \gll    það rigndi í  gaer.\\
            it rains on morning\\
    \ex Null expletive\is{expletives}\\
        Í gaer rigndi  (*það).
    \z
\z

However, concerning generic null subjects, \ili{Icelandic} is exactly like
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}. According to \citet{SigurdssonEgerland2009},
this language has null expletives and, in addition, the following generic types
of sentences: (a) \emph{generic}, like generic \ili{English} \emph{you;} (b)
\emph{arbitrary}, like \ili{English} \emph{they;} and \emph{Specific} often
referring to the speaker or a group including the speaker.

	\gll	Í þessari      fjölskyldu drekkur þú bara ekki áfengi\\

\gls{BP} can have exactly the same type of generic/arbitrary NSs:

\ea%51
    \label{ex:26.51}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
    \gll    Ali $\varnothing$ não chega  em 30 minutos\\
            there {} not arrives in 30 minutes\\
    \ex
    \gll    Na nossa familia $\varnothing$ não bebe pinga.\\
            in   our family {}       not drinks brandy\\
    \ex
    \gll    Eles dizem que $\varnothing$  vai  chover  amanhã.\\
            they say  that {} goes to.rain   tomorrow\\
    \ex
    \gll    $\varnothing$ Pegaram o culpado ontem à noite.\\
            (they) caught   the culprit  yesterday evening\\
    \z
\z\largerpage[2]

What is different with respect to \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is the
variation allowed between the NS and the weak pronouns (\emph{você} and \emph{a
    gente}), a possibility nonexistent in \ili{Icelandic}.\footnote{As shown
    before, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} allows personal sentences with
    climate verbs:

\begin{exe}
    \exi{(i)} Essas florestas tropicais chovem muito.\\
            \enquote*{These rain forests rain.\Tpl{} a lot.}
    \exi{(ii)} Todos os meus aniversários chovem, porque  eu faço aniversário em novembro.\\
            \enquote*{All the my birthdays rain.\Tpl{}, because my birthday is
            in November.}, lit. \enquote*{\dots{} I do birthday in November}
\end{exe}}

\ea%52
    \label{ex:26.52}\ili{Brazilian Portuguese}
    \ea
    \gll    Ali    \textbf{você} não chega em 30 minutos\\
            there you  not  arrive in 30 minutes\\
    \ex
    \gll    Na nossa familia \textbf{a gente }              não bebe pinga.\\
            in   our family {we (the folks)}  not drinks brandy\\
    \ex     \textbf{Eles} pegaram o culpado ontem à noite.

It seems, therefore, that \emph{semi} \emph{NS} languages should be split in
three types, the last of which has referential overt pronouns, Null expletives
and null generic subjects.

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:26.4}

After examining several empirical and theoretical works related to syntactic
phenomena in Brazilian Portuguese, \citet[411]{Roberts1993b} considered that
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} was in fact undergoing a series of deep
changes along the past century, which suggested parametric changes in progress.
He added that the authors’ privileged patrimony was mainly in the rich “raw
material” they worked with, combining quantitative evidence and theoretically
inspired hypotheses.

The present chapter reports on work done on the NS conducted after
\citegen{RobKat1993} edited volume, and contains a reflection about the nature
of the NS phenomenon in \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} in light of recent
theoretical hypotheses on the NS parameter.

We compared \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} with five language types: (a) the
consistent [NS] type; (b) the radical\is{null subject languages!radical null
subject languages} [NS] type; (c) the partial [NS] type,\is{null subject languages!partial null subject languages} (d)
the [$-$NS] type and the semi [$-$NS] type.\is{null subject languages!semi null subject languages}  The comparison has led to the
following summary:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item except for the expletive\is{expletives} NS, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese}
\textit{core} grammar has almost entirely lost any similarities with
\gls{EP}\il{European Portuguese}, a consistent \gls{NSL}\is{null subject languages};

\item (i) generic sentences with NSs are similar to the Japanese NSs
ones, but \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} generic sentences resort more
frequently to personal constructions with \emph{você} and \emph{a}
\emph{gente;} (ii) Japanese \isi{raising} structures are superficially similar to the
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} ones,  as in the latter they trigger
agreement, whereas in Japanese the subject gets the topic marker \emph{-wa}.

\item (i)  \ili{Finnish} is similar to \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian
Portuguese} \textit{written language}, in the optionality between referential
NS and overt pronouns; (ii) even  though \ili{Finnish} and
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} often resort to topicalization, in
\gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} topics are in SpecTP, triggering agreement,
while in \ili{Finnish} they seem to be in SpecFP, an A$'$-position;

\item (i) \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} has no lexical
expletives or indefinite  pronouns like \emph{one}  in \ili{English}; (ii) but,
in its referential NSs, \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is exactly like
\ili{English} in production and comprehension: a [$-$NS] language.
\end{enumerate}

In conclusion, the \isi{core grammar} of \gls{BP}\il{Brazilian Portuguese} is
(i) a [$-$NS] language with regard to referential subjects, and (ii) a [+NS] of
the consistent type regarding null expletives; and (iii) a [+NS] of the
radical\is{null subject languages!radical null subject languages}
type concerning the null generic subjects. As for the system of the literate
adult, it maintains the null expletives and null generic subjects of the core
grammar, while, with regard to referential expressions, they are partly
pronominal (DP), like in the child \isi{core grammar}, and [$-$NS] like
\ili{English}.
