\title{Echoes of the past: Hewramî narratives}
\BackBody{%
This book is a collection of 15 narratives in Hewramî. It offers a unique window into the life of Hewramî speakers, including their oral and social history, social relations, recollections of past life, and storytelling traditions. The stories were told by five narrators. All the stories have been transcribed, translated, annotated, and analysed.\\

The volume contains an introduction that provides an overview of the language and speech community. The texts are presented in two formats: as parallel column texts (Hewramî/English) and as interlinearised glossed texts, containing detailed linguistic analysis. Many of the narratives contain elements of hagiographies, focusing on moral lessons.
