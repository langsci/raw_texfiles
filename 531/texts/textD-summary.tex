A swarm of grasshoppers approached Sharazour. Their head sent a delegate to Sheikh Aladin to ask him to let them stay one day around the city. The sheikh gave them permission on the condition that they remain on his lands. The next day, the sheikh’s farm labourers noticed that the grasshoppers had damaged all the crops. When they asked the Sheikh why he let the grasshoppers attack his lands, he replied that his products were not that good that year, and had he not let them stay on his lands, the grasshoppers would have done more harm to the people of Sharazour.
