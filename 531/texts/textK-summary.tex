Once, a king went to the forest to hunt some birds. He ran into a fortune teller who said the king’s daughter was destined to marry a shepherd’s son. To avoid this destiny, the king ordered the killing of pregnant women in his kingdom. The shepherd’s wife, who was pregnant, ran away and gave birth to a boy. The boy grew up and was recruited as a servant in the king’s palace. A few years later, the king was informed that the servant was indeed the shepherd’s son and ordered his killing in a letter to his relatives. The king’s daughter, who had fallen in love with the shepherd’s son, changed the letter’s content so that she could marry the shepherd’s son while the king was still away.
