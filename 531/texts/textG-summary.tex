In earlier times, there was a ruler in Hewraman called Sibhan Agha. Once, a person called Jamsher Shah came to Hewraman with his forces and resided in the castle of Hewraman. He stayed in Hewraman for seven years and claimed power over it. Sibham Agha did not consent to that and instead cut off Jamsher Shah’s water supply. Later, Jamsher Shah played a trick on Sibhan Agha, pretending to make peace, and seized power in the Hewraman region.
