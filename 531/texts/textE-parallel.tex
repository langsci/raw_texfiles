May God grant him glory; may God forgive him; We were under their rule, that is, Sheikh Osman, well rather Sheikh Aladin, in this region and far beyond until Sanandaj and, eh, Baghdad. If we happened to be ill, there was no doctor. We would go to them and they would bless us, and God would protect us from illness. For a long time, let's say from the period of Sheikh Ghayasadin until today, they have been the Sheikhs in our region. Imagine there has been a large area of land under their control, then, let me tell you that the Sheikhs have ruled this region with piousness as far as Sanandaj and Turkmen Sahra.}
