The water had risen to the level of the flour sacks that they had. There was some sugar and tea, well then, there was neither bread, nor water, nor anything else, there was nothing left.

He took one of the baby boys, and put him in a hole in a valley, a thingummy, in the hollow of a tree. I have heard this tale from -- it is the Sheikh's words -- Sheikh Aladin.
