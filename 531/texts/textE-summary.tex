The inhabitants of a village expelled a man who suffered from leprosy. His brother took him to a cave and took care of him. At last, he was advised to take his brother to Biyare and Sheikh Aladin for treatment. Sheikh Aladin told him that the medicine for his brother’s treatment comes from tortoise blood, which he should rub on his body. A representative of the tortoises went to the Sheikh and asked him not to injure them. The Sheikh accepted and asked the man to go to his village and harm a tortoise from there. After a month, the man returned to the Sheikh with his brother, who was now healed.
