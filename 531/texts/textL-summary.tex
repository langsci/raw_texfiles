Once, Sultan Mahmoud and his advisor, Heyas the Wise, quarrelled. Heyas left the palace and went to Hewraman. He married a girl there and returned to the court. The Sultan had learned that Heyas had married a beautiful woman. Therefore, he sent Heyas to Kurdistan for a mission so that he wouldn’t return that night. Sultan Mahmud then went to Heyas’s house and was welcomed by his beautiful wife. He expressed his interest in her. However, she declined and made him take back his proposal by colouring some eggs and showing him that although the eggs were different in colour, they all tasted the same. The sultan, who had learned a good lesson from Heyas’s wife, accepted her as his close relative.
