    \ParallelRText{\noindent Let me tell you. I have even heard this. It is well known that a swarm of grasshoppers came to Sharazour one night. They came from the south. They came from every direction. They came from God. They came to Sharazour. The head of the grasshoppers said, ``Without permission from this person, we cannot stay here and do harm to this region.'' He, i.e., the head of the grasshoppers, sent a representative to Sheikh Aladin. He sent a messenger to Biyare, and said, ``Go into his presence! See if he lets us stay here for lunch or not.''}

The property might have been filled with crops, and they might have been ripe. He meant the crops which were ready to be harvested. He said, ``Go!
