This book is a collection of 15 narratives from the Tekht variety of Hewramî. The material for this book was mainly gathered in August 2022 in the Hewraman region of Iranian Kurdistan while I was conducting fieldwork for my grammar of Hewramî. I owe a great debt of gratitude to the following narrators in Hewraman Tekht: Mohammad, Amin, Saleh, Hanifa, and Moʿmen. The book wouldn't have been possible without their openness to share stories about their lives and different socio-historical aspects of the region. It is my hope that this work does justice to their language and heritage.

I would also like to thank my colleague Katherine Hodgson for offering help with checking the English translation of the texts. Katherine patiently looked into the English with me on multiple rounds to ensure that the English translation reflected the Hewramî structures as closely as possible. I am equally grateful to Shuan Osman Karim for converting the glossed texts in FLEX into the specific formatting required for linguistic examples by Language Science Press using a Python script. 

Special thanks to Christian Döhler for accepting the book for inclusion in the Open Text Collections series. Christian went out of his way to offer help with typesetting the book and provided valuable insights about the structure and formatting of texts. Thanks are due to Sebastian Nordhoff for his technical support and Matthew Korte for proofreading the monograph. Matthew carefully identified inconsistences in the punctuation and alignment issues in the glosses.
