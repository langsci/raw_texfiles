\addchap{\lsAcknowledgementTitle} 

 
This book is a matured and reworked version of my PhD dissertation. Among all the people who inspired me, encouraged me and asked me hard questions during my graduate years, my PhD advisor Eva-Maria Remberger deserves a special mention here and, of course, my most sincere gratitude.  I also thank my editors, in particular Anne Wolfsgruber, for their support, and the  reviewers for their insightful comments. I furthermore thank Felix Kopecky, Sebastian Nordhoff and the community proofreaders at Language Science Press for their excellent and thorough work.
Finally, I thank António Variações and Leonard Cohen who kept me company and, without knowing it, wrote the soundtrack for this book.
