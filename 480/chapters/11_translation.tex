    \ParallelRText{\noindent At this time, there was a feast in \textit{Forzitho}. There was a dance and people from here went there. They had also invited people from \textit{Smärki}. There was one man from \textit{Forzitho}. He had exchanged wives with those ones. He might have been from whatchamacallit, a man from \textit{Koréth}. Another name for that place is \textit{Méngte}. Well, so they came for the pig dance. It is customary to raise a pig and kill it for the dance. This is the way. As they came to \textit{Forzitho}, they brought the dance into the village and they danced until midnight. The whole night passed and it was almost dawn. That was when they burned the bark. When they burned the bark it was the \textit{Forzitho} man, his exchange man, who was talking. He burned the torch. They were talking angrily. He got into an argument with his exchange man.}

    \ParallelRText{\noindent He had previously put a box of mat-ches in his pocket, in his clothes, in the bag. As he talked himself into a rage, this man from \textit{Forzitho}, he took out the matchbox. He pulled it out and got one match. It wasn't one of these lighters. Nowadays, there are cigarette lighters, not this type or lighter. These were real matches. These were match sticks. So the man from \textit{Forzitho} took one match out. He held up the matchbox on one side with his hand. He held the match stick in his other hand. He was talking angrily ``When I take this out, it will start the real fire, the Kidn fire!'' They used to call the mythical fire sometimes Kidn. When people saw this, they got scared. They were thinking like this: This Kidn is from long time ago, when the earth was created, when god made the earth. This Kidn fire was hidden at the time. There was a bird named tütü. That tütü bird that was calling out today. She was hiding the Kidn fire.}

As he took out the matches, the people ran off in all directions. They were afraid of this small matchbox. All the people who had come to the dance ran away. They forgot about the pig, the food and everything else. They all were really scared. He continued ``When I light this up, when it strikes, all the people will burn here.'' They were afraid and said: ``Get him, hold him! He could start the fire and we'll all burn.'' A few men came and tied up his hands. They took the fire from him, the matchbox really. He said: ``Now you're feeling it! This is what will happen if you make fun of me.'' Others almost broke their feathers on their headdresses and smashed their drums. They ran away in fear because of these matches. Then they took the matchbox away from him and they sat him down. They said ``Why are you doing this? We all could have burned, all the little children and the old women. Who shall live from now on?'' They sat him down properly. They poured him some kava to calm his anger. They bottled him with kava. He was lying there drunk out of his mind. They put an end to his angry thoughts.}

But in the past, people were afraid. They were really scared wondering ``Is it a bomb or could it be a bomb?'' That's how it was. The old people did not really know about those things at the time. Our fathers did not know and they did not go to school. There was no knowledge about this. Nothing was known about this. They did not know about it, so they were afraid of it. It was their first time to see matches.}
