As for my mother, this old woman here, she went hunting. She killed animals. She hunted cassowaries. She hunted deer. She hunted wallabies. Okay, so the two of us went hunting. We were making our way, when the dogs started chasing a pig. There is a funny part in this story. Then we walked and walked and the dogs started chasing the pig. The late mother said to us: ``You climb up!'' My big sister lifted me up on the tree. I couldn't climb then. So she put me up, maybe up to this height. She put me up on the Zürémb tree. There stood some Zürémb trees on the side. At my place there were some Zürémb trees on the side of that paperbark grove. Then my big sister put me on top because she was afraid. She put me up because she was afraid that the pig might bite me. So she put me up, and she climbed up herself. But the old woman went for it.}

She still had a white scar, where it wounded her. When she came back, she was limping. She had killed the cassowary with the help of the dogs, but she had to leave it there. She was walking back slowly. She said to the other mother ``The cassowary is lying there. I killed it already! It has pierced my leg and I almost stepped on these sharp bamboos.'' The poor mother was wounded on the leg by the cassowary. This is how mother has provided for us, only the two mothers, no one else was helping us.}

So we came to \textit{Kanathér} and crossed river there, where that one lives, where Ben was living. There used to be these canteen houses. It was accommodation for the workers there. We went across the river and we slept there. Then they enrolled us in school. I went to school on some days, but on other days I didn't. Sometimes my mother carried me there on her shoulders. She would always drop me off at \textit{Morehead} station, at the school. I wasn't very interested in school. I was like a ``wild'' girl, or whatever they call those who live in the forest. We used to live in the bush. We did not live in a proper house. My mothers lived in the bush. They took me out of school. Only my big sister went and she did well in school. But it was different with me. Some days, she really had to carry me to the school. Then she waited there for me and brought me back. We returned to \textit{Kanathér}.
