I thank the Farem people for welcoming me into their community, for safeguarding me and for teaching me their beautiful language. In the context of this book, I thank them especially for sharing their stories with me. I was only able to include a few of these wonderful narratives in this book.

I pay tribute to the nine narrators here, who are the rightful authors and owners of the texts prepared for this collection: Ruth Abia, Lucy Abia, Daure Kaumb, Maembu Kwozi, Kurai Tawéth, Maraga Kwozi, Abia Bai, Kaumb Bai, the late Marua Bai.

I would like to thank Sebastian Nordhoff and Mandana Seyfeddinipur for their patience with my progress, and Kilu von Prince for organising the review of this book. The two reviewers were Karolin Obert and Kate L. Lindsey. Other comments came from Jeff Good, Andreas Hölzl and Carolyn O'Meara. Sebastian Nordhoff proofread the entire manuscript. I have benefited greatly from the suggestions of all those involved and am very grateful for their help.
