    \ParallelRText{\noindent Before the revenge attack, they discussed their plans. Ote and Yasi did that. They planned it in \textit{Tamnzüfi}. \textit{Tamnzüfi} lies on the other side of the river in \textit{Fothér} forest. They agreed on a plan to take revenge on them, to avenge their clan members, who were killed at \textit{Firra}, against those who had killed Srank. They allied themselves with the people of \textit{Mogarkam}. Some of their elders were living there. Likewise with \textit{Fethkakar}, they also became allies. Some of their elders were from the \textit{Farem} people. So they had formed an alliance at that time. All these headhunters gathered at whatchamacallit, at \textit{Tämnzüfi}. They discussed how they would attack the people of \textit{Téndöfi}. A few people living in \textit{Téndöfi} were from \textit{Safés}. It was them who had formed an alliance in the attack on \textit{Firra}. That is reason why they took revenge at \textit{Téndöfi}.}

From \textit{Sazäthi}, they took a shortcut to \textit{Térén Zäre}. From \textit{Térén Zäre} they walked to \textit{Käs}. They gathered in \textit{Käs} and sat closely together collecting the names of their victims. They were breaking small twigs. They broke the twigs like this. They put a name to each twig. For this man's name they broke one twig, and for that man's name they broke another twig. They did this for as many people as lived on the other side of the river in \textit{Téndöfi}, for every woman, for the children and the men.}

    \ParallelRText{\noindent There was one man amongst the headhunters who was from our clan, from this village here, from the \textit{Farem} people. He had exchanged wives with the people from \textit{Safés}, and this family was also there in \textit{Téndöfi}. So he told the others: ``My exchange man is staying there. My exchange woman is there. I will go ahead. I will tell my exchange man what is going to happen.'' He followed the riverbank for a short distance. Not far from \textit{Käs}, he called out for the canoe. His exchange man heard him and said ``Oh, someone is calling for the canoe.'' Well, he was already dressed up wearing his headdress. He was carrying his bow and arrow. His exchange man came and he looked at him. He gave his exchange man tobacco, really strong tobacco. He was smoking it first, the one who went from here, the headhunter. It was really strong tobacco. He gave him the tobacco. He puffed it, but he did not understand the sign, and thought ``He gave me this strong tobacco. Why did he give me the strong tobacco?'' Later he was biting his tongue towards his exchange man. He bit on his tongue in an aggressive way. That's when his exchange man got the message ``This is a headhunter.''}

So he told his wife ``We are going to leave!'' The exchange man told him: ``You go ahead. I will take the old canoe across and I will come back the day after tomorrow.'' They said goodbye to each other. He went across to meet the other headhunters. He told them ``It is like this and like this. There are lots of men, women and children.

The whole group of \textit{Farem} headhunters went across. They surrounded the village and sealed it off. Then the attack began. They shot their arrows and started fighting.

They tried to break this neck bone here. They didn't succeed and the poor girl was struggling to free herself. Meanwhile, the other headhunters had killed all the other villagers. They started to cross the river again. Only that girl was still fighting with the two men. They threw her to the ground trying to break her neck, when one of them realized ``Oh brother, everyone's gone! They've left us behind.'' They let go of the girl. She was bleeding badly and gurgling from her throat. The two ran away. ``Hey!'' They gave a signal and the others answered them. They were on the other side of the river with the canoe.
