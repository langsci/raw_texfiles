The story is set in the time when the Morehead people had just been contacted by the colonial administrators and were exposed to ``modern technology''. More specifically, the story is about the introduction of the matchbox as a means of making fire.

In the story, a feast was celebrated in the nearby village of \textit{Forzitho}, to which many people travelled from villages further west. The guests sang and danced all night long, interrupted only by breaks to sit down and take a rest. During this time, it is customary that respected elders stand up and give a speech, and there is a special genre for these speeches called \textit{se zokwasi} `bark torch speech'. The story is about an argument between two men who have exchanged sisters, a man from \textit{Forzitho} and a man from \textit{Kor√©th}.

The man from \textit{Forzitho} talked himself into a rage during his \textit{se zokwasi}. In the midst of this rage, he pulled out a box of matches and announced to the crowd that he can make fire with this little thing. He claimed that he can use it to light the primordial fire, which is called \textit{kidn} in Komnzo. This was the fire that destroyed the mythical tree from which all humans descend. The audience was deeply shocked by his speech. They threw everything away, hid or ran away. A few brave ones pinned down the man and took the matchbox from him. They gave him kava to dampen his anger and also his physical movements. Finally, the dance continued until the early hours of the morning, when the people slaughtered a pig and distributed the food.
