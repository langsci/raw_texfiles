The story is about a headhunt that took place in the village of \textit{Téndöfi}. The raid was revenge for an earlier attack on the village of \textit{Firra}, in which most of the inhabitants of \textit{Firra} were killed. Some of the survivors of the Mayawa clan joined forces with the inhabitants of \textit{Masu}, \textit{Mongarkam} and \textit{Fethkakar} and led the revenge campaign. The protagonists are Yasi and Ote.

The headhunters travel to \textit{Tämnzüfi}, which is located on the opposite side of the Morehead River. They perform a ritual to ensure that their victims are unaware of the impending attack and go to sleep.

One of the headhunters has relatives in \textit{Téndöfi}. He goes to the village and warns his exchange man and his family. After his return, the attackers wait until nightfall, then cross the river and surround the village. They enter the village and kill most of the inhabitants. Yasi and Ote fight with a young woman who is trying to free herself. Suddenly they realise that the other headhunters have finished their work and have already left the village. They leave the woman behind and follow the others.

On their return, the headhunters are welcomed back to their village by the women, who dance and sing for them. They celebrate the successful raid.
