This Nzürna story is set at \textit{Wataya} forest, about 5km East of \textit{Rouku}. In the plot of the story, a young girl is tricked by the Nzürna, who pretends to be one of her mothers. Realising what is going on, the young girl runs back to the village and meets her father. The father alarms the other villagers. They hide two girls in the yam house covering them with mats and yams. They try to protect them by dancing and drumming around the yam house. During the evening, the Nzürna sneaks around the yam house and makes everyone sleepy by throwing dust in their eyes. Once they sleep, she opens the yam house, kills and eats the girl. The next day, the villagers take revenge. Two sorcerers find the Wäsü tree and block the entrance. They pile firewood on the door, set it on fire, and kill the Nzürna.
