In this story, the Nzürna was on good terms with the people of \textit{Firra}. During the day, when people were out in their gardens, she would come to the village looking after the houses. One day, a stranger comes to the village. The Nzürna welcomes him pretending to be a friendly host. She realises that the man is not from \textit{Firra}, and seizes the opportunity. During the night, she kills and eats him. Then she returns to her Wäsü tree. When the villagers realise what has happened, they go after her and kill her. As in all Nzürna stories, she is burned in her Wäsü tree.
