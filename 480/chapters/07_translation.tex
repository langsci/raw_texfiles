When the villagers left the village to attend their gardens or to go hunting, or when they stayed overnight somewhere, that Nzürna took over their place. She came to the village. When she saw rubbish lying around, when the people had left their belongings scattered around and there was rubbish everywhere, that's when she would grab the broom and sweep the place. She cleared their house yards. She put everything back in the right order. She put those things back in the house for them, for example small pieces of firewood. Then she returned to her own place. When they returned, the house owners said: ``Oh, this woman was here. She has swept the house yard here.'' Back then, the villagers were aware of their ties to the Nzürna. Only the people of that particular village were on good terms with the Nzürna. She did not attack them, because they were her friends. They knew about each other. They were like her children.
