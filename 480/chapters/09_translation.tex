Kukufia lived in \textit{Masu}. He had two wives. There was another man who lived here in \textit{Rouku}. He had one wife. He set off to cut down a sago palm. The name of that place is \textit{Karesa Zfth}. While he was there at \textit{Karesa Zfth}, he left his two children here, the older girl and younger boy.}

    \ParallelRText{\noindent One day, Kukufia set off to go fishing. He went down to the river to paddle his canoe and look for fish. He had his harpoon to spear fish. He put the things in the canoe. He got into the canoe and set off. He paddled all the way to the \textit{Mnzärfr}. This is a place on the riverbank. Then he left the canoe there and started to walk up here. When he came up, he shouted. He called his name ``Kukufia Kukufia Kukufia''. In the absence of their father, the little children heard this. ``Little brother, there's a man shouting!'' The two were there in the house, in the sleeping house, in the big house. Then Kukufia approached. He asked them, ``Hey, who are you in the house? Who are you in there?'' The little ones didn't answer. They gave no answer. He approached the house and knocked hard. He knocked on the other side. The little children came out. The big girl and the small boy.}

Kukufia stood there with his harpoon, looking for fish. Then he speared a kwazür fish. With the kwazür spines, he pricked the little boy. With those three spines on the kwazür, he poked him with those. From there they paddled a little further and he shot a catfish. They paddled until \textit{Kaftfr} and then returned from there. The boy must have cried because of the pain. But Kukufia wasn't paying attention. They paddled back to the canoe place at \textit{Mnzärfr}. From there, he brought them back. He sent the little children away and he returned to \textit{Masu} by canoe. He came up from the river and showed his wives the fish. He continued this over the course of three days.}
