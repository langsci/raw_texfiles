    \ParallelRText{\noindent The Nzürna lived in the big forest of \textit{Wataya} on the \textit{Masu} side. She came this way with her fish net catching fish at the creek, small fish, the ŋarufay fish. She was catching those ones. The small girl was walking past, when they saw each other. The Nzürna called out to her: ``Come over! Come here! The others are already far ahead. Let's stay here. We will poison this creek right here.'' She was deceiving her badly, pretending to be one of her mothers. She said to her ``You go over there! Try to chase the fish this way!'' The Nzürna caught small fish with her net. She caught them until the fish net was full. The Nzürna ate them up quickly. She gulped down the whole fish. They walked to another bend in the creek. She caught them and again ``nom nom nom'' she swallowed them. The little girl looked at her and thought ``This is not my mother. This is a Nzürna.''}

She went and tore open the yam house. She went inside and looked at the two girls. ``Not this one'', she said, ``but this is the one.'' She untied their hair and carried one of the girls to the door. As for the other girl, she plucked out one of her eyes and then the other eye. Next she pushed her hand into her arse and ripped out the intestines. Then she ate her intestines. This happened while the people were fast asleep. What are you laughing at? [to someone in the audience] While the people were sleeping, she ate her up. Then she hung the remaining guts on a post.

They chose their best sorcerers. They went after her until they found the tree. ``Oh, she's in here!'' Then they wrapped up the wäsi tree with their magic spells. They piled firewood at the base and set it on fire. It burned and burned. The Nzürna was looking outside ``Oh, there is fire!'' She tried to put out the fire by peeing on it, but that didn't work. She tried to spray the fire with her shit, but that didn't work either. She threw the girl's skull to extinguish the fire, but that didn't work. In the end, she burned with the tree and everything else. Eventually the tree fell over. Well, that Kukakuka bird was just about to call out and escape with her, but the sorcerers grabbed it and burned it too. They ground up the charcoal, the last remains of her, until everything was gone. The story is finished now. }
