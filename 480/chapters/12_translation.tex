    \ParallelRText{\noindent Father said to us ``I'll go hunting''. It was on Sunday. Father set off to go hunting. He went across the river to \textit{Kuf}. Some young girls were living there, bush girls. As father departed, he began hunting for pigs with his dogs. The dogs started barking at the pigs. This was a clear place without trees, only dödö bushes. These dödö that we use as a broom. Only those bushes were there. Then father aimed with his bow and arrow, and he shot it. He shot it and left it there. he heard these girls. These bush girls were shouting. Okay, they were doing this but father thought to himself ``This could be my aunt and my uncle.'' Phillip's mother, his sister really. ``It could be her.''}

As he arrived, father told us ``I just killed a pig, a huge one! But how can I carry it alone? There was also someone screaming there. Which girls were screaming there? Those bush girls?'' Then he took us there. We walked quickly. We burned the fur off the pig. Father didn't know how to cut it up. Only me, I was in charge of slaughtering pigs. Father told me: ``Cut up the pig quickly!'' I finished it and we packed it up.}

    \ParallelRText{\noindent Riley and Alice were staying here, where the old woman is living. She stayed in the house. She was looking after them. Father made a flute from the small bamboo. In those days we blew these flutes ``kuuuuu'' when we had hunting luck. When we got big animals like pigs or cassowaries, when we killed something big. That's when we blew the kufraru flute. Oh, it's not the kufraru. It's the other one made from the small bamboo, the turatura flute. That's the one we blew. It is similar to the kufraru flute. They cut the turatura flute from the small bamboo. That's the one we were blowing. We went back home. Riley was still very small, he was in the baby basket. Alice was running around saying ``Our father is making me happy.''}

Okay, that's the end of the story. These are small stories.}
