One wife was from \textit{Kanfok} and the other was from Masu. Neither of those two women had children. Bres was a hunter, a night hunter. He used to go this way, to \textit{Kwonä Trkr} and to \textit{Débäwéth}. Okay, there was a Nzürna living in \textit{Débäwéth}. One day he had set a thingamajig, a trap with a bamboo string. He went early in the morning. He caught wallaby, pig and cassowary. He carried them back to the house. The two wives cooked them in the oven.}

    \ParallelRText{\noindent One day all the Farem people went for a dance at \textit{Kanfok}. It was a nzürna dance. Bres' wives followed the others to that dancing place. They left Bres and the old woman behind. After they had left, Bres went and checked his traps. He took out a wallaby, a deer and a pig. He prepared the oven and piled up firewood. He made that oven in \textit{Débäwéth}. He stayed over there. He burned off the fur. That was when the Nzürna appeared. She called out to him ``My child, what are you doing?'' Bres saw her and thought ``Hey, my mother told me about this one, about this Nzürna who is moving around here. ``You be careful!'' is what she told me.''}

Bad thoughts arose in his mind. They closed up the oven. They threw out the little pieces of wood. They covered the wallaby meat. }

Then he told her: ``You go and fetch some water for me from \textit{Débäwéth}. Break some bamboos after that!'' ``Okay, I will do that.'' She pretended to walk away, but she hid behind a tree. She leaned against the tree and pissed in the container. She brought back the urine for him and said ``Here you go.'' He smelled it and said ``No, you just pissed into it. Go again and smash the bamboos too.'' She walked away and this time she really smashed the bamboo against her head.}

She gulped down the wallaby meat and the leaves, barks and even the stones from the oven. Then she began to follow him calling out ‘Bres, put down some wallaby meat for me!’ He left a leg of the wallaby on a branch for her. She gobbled it down and asked for more. Again he left some meat on the path and she swallowed it whole. They kept doing this until they approached the house.}

She sat down by the fire at the house door. Then the Nzürna arrived and said ``Oh dear friend!'' The old woman and the Nzürna began to fight. The old woman smacked her with the digging stick ``What pain are you giving me? Bring out my child! He is in here.'' The old woman replied ``I don't have any children.'' They fought and fought, until the Nzürna sent a centipede into the house. It bit Bres on the back and he yelled ``aaah''. The Nzürna cut the string and went inside. She said, ``You lead the way!''

Nzürna's husband, the old man, had already fled. Earlier when she had arrived with a full stomach, he had asked: ``Are you okay? What is with your stomach? There was a man walking along here. You might have killed him!'' She replied ``What? Did you get any meat for the children? You just go to sleep!'' Okay, she finally threw herself into the fire and burned to death.
