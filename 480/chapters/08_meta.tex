\textit{Nzürna trikasi bresanema} is narrative lasting roughly 10min. It was recorded by Christian Döhler on August 27\textsuperscript{th} 2012, in both audio and video formats.\footnote{The original recording session for this text is labelled tci20120827-03. It is archived at: \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11189856}{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11189856}} The story teller is Kurai Tawéth, and the recording took place in front of the yam house of one of his brothers in \textit{Rouku} village. Kurai grew up in a Wära speaking environment, and he feels embarrassed about the fact that he speaks a different dialect. Consequently, this story has already been adapted to the Komnzo dialect in the transcription, i.e. it differs from the original recording.
