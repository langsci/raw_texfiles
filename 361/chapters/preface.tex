\addchap{\lsPrefaceTitle} 

Over the past two and a half years, the History and Philosophy of the Language Sciences podcast (\url{https://hiphilangsci.net/category/podcast/}) has been exploring the history of modern linguistics, from its beginnings in the early nineteenth century up to the present. This volume brings together transcripts of ten interviews from the podcast on topics related to the history of European linguistics. 

The transcripts published here diverge in some ways from the broadcast interviews: the interviewees and I have edited the transcripts for clarity and completeness, and to insert all the witty repartee that we have thought of in the meantime. The original audio file of each interview can be found under the DOI link at the bottom of the first page in each chapter.

The podcast consists not only of interviews, but also episodes that take the form of short lectures. These episodes will be published in substantially revised and expanded form in the book \textit{A History of Modern Linguistics}, forthcoming with Edinburgh University Press.

The podcast is ongoing and is constantly branching out into new areas. Further monographs and collected volumes of interviews will appear in the near future.\bigskip\\
