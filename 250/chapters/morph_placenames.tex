\chapter{Place names and microtoponyms}\label{cpt:morph-placenames}\largerpage[2]

Tables \ref{tab:Names for villages, towns, and districts, and their inhabitants} and \ref{tab:Generic locations and their inhabitants} show names for the villages, towns, and districts that are relevant to the Sanzhi people. The tables first provide the citation form of the place name followed by the essive case, \tie\ the word form that needs to be used when answering the question \tit{Where are you?} The last two place names, Druzhba and Makahchkala, morphosyntactically differ from all the others because they represent recent borrowings. In order to form the essive case they need to employ the locational case suffix -\textit{le} (\refsec{sssec:spr-lative -le/-ja/-a, spr-essive -le-b/-ja-b/-a-b and spr-ablative -le-r/-ja-r/-a-r}). The other place names do not need such an additional \isi{spatial case} because the place names have by themselves spatial meaning just like spatial adverbials because this is their default use. With these older place names it might diachronically be possible to identify a root morpheme that represents the place name followed by a \isi{spatial case} suffix, but synchronically Sanzhi has no \is{spatial case}spatial cases that consist of a vowel \textit{i} (the most frequent word-final segment of the place names in Table \ref{tab:Names for villages, towns, and districts, and their inhabitants}).  Other Dargwa varieties such as Chirag \citep{GanenkovChiragSketch}, however, have a \isi{spatial case} expressed by a suffix \textit{-i} that functionally resemble the Sanzhi locational case.

The third column contains referential-attributive terms that are semantically related to the respective places. These terms are formed by adding \tit{-(a)n} to a root that can be the place name or some other root related to it. This suffix might be a cognate of the \isi{locative participle} suffix \textit{-an} (\refsec{sssec:The locative participle}) and/or the \is{interrogative clause}interrogative clauses -\textit{an} \refsec{sssec:The modal participle -an}. Another possible cognate is the \isi{adjectivizer} \textit{-(a)n}, which is used for the formation of a few \isi{adjectives} involving \isi{compounding} with numerals and mostly plural \isi{nouns} (\refsec{sec:Derivation of adjectives}). The same suffix seems to occur in the \isi{derivation} of the adjective \textit{b-urkːa-l-an} \sqt{middle} from the postposition \textit{b-urkːa} \sqt{between}. In the default case, these terms refer to the inhabitants of the respective places as the term \textit{the English} can refer to English people. They are also used as attributes of head \isi{nouns} that do not refer to human beings but to their language, customs, clothes, etc., just like the use of \textit{English} in the phrase \textit{the English language}.

Syntactically, the referential attributes in the third column function like other referential attributes formed by means of the two \is{cross-categorical suffix}cross-categorical suffixes -\textit{ce} and -\textit{il} (\refsec{ssec:The -ce / -te attributive} and \refsec{ssec:The -il attributive}). This means that they largely possess the syntactic properties of \isi{nouns}. They are used in argument position \refex{ex:The Urkarakh people complained and put him into prison} or as predicates \refex{ex:Was he Kumyk No (he) was Dargwa}. They can also modify \isi{nouns} as the last column `language' shows. The constructions in the last column, which resemble compound \isi{nouns} a bit (\refsec{ssec:AdjN}), can probably be analyzed as nominal appositions similar to the combination of proper names and kinship terms (\refsec{ssec:Lexical, phrasal, and clausal modifiers in noun phrases}). Just like with referential attributes that are marked with -\textit{ce}, plural formation occurs by means of the most common plural suffix \tit{-te} \refex{ex:The Urkarakh people complained and put him into prison}. 

The fourth column contains terms referring to the ethnic group. These terms are a kind of mass \isi{nouns} that trigger human plural agreement like the word \tit{χalq'} \sqt{people}. The last column contains the terms for the language. Language names contain the word \tit{ʁaj} \sqt{language}, which is preceded by either (i) the singular term for the inhabitants, (ii) the \isi{genitive} of the term for the ethnic group, or (iii) the \isi{genitive} of the place name.\pagebreak

As can be seen in Table \ref{tab:Generic locations and their inhabitants}, the noun \textit{qːatːa} forms the essive case by changing the pitch accent to the final vowel (this is an irregular way to form the locational case; it is also found with a few other \isi{nouns}). The noun \textit{šːi} `village' also has an irregular locational case form, whereas \textit{dubur} is regularly inflected for either the \textsc{loc}-series (suffix -\textit{le}, assimilated to -\textit{re}) or the \textsc{in}-series (suffix -\textit{cːe}). If not specified otherwise, \textit{šːi} `village' refers to the village of Sanzhi.

The place names only inflect for directional cases (essive, lative, \isi{ablative}). As can be seen when comparing the two columns in \reftab{tab:Names for villages, towns, and districts, and their inhabitants}, the place names mostly have directional meaning, \tie\ the lative is identical to the place names themselves. Examples are given in \refexrange{ex:I came to Urkarakh by call}{ex:one through the peak on which there is}. In the speech of a few younger speakers (age 30 or younger) I noticed the use of the  \textsc{loc}-series marker with the word \textit{sːanži}, i.e., they used the explicit marking \textit{sːanži-le} instead of \textit{sːanži} when talking about going to the village \refex{ex:He always told us}. This might be due to Russian influence because Russian place names do not have inherent locative meaning, but require explicit case marking (in Sanzhi and Russian) as the last two lines in Tables \ref{tab:Names for villages, towns, and districts, and their inhabitants} show.

The referential attributive terms and the terms for the ethnic groups (fourth and fifth column) inflect like standard \isi{nouns}, for example \textit{sungul} \sqt{Sanzhi people}, \isi{ergative} \textit{sungul-li}, \isi{genitive} \textit{sungul-la}\slash\textit{sungli-la}, \isi{dative} \textit{sungul-li-j}, and \textit{sunglante} \sqt{Sanzhi villagers}, \isi{ergative} \textit{sunglan-t-a-l}, \isi{genitive} \textit{sunglan-t-a-la}, and so on.

\reftab{tab:Ethnic groups} displays terms for referential attributes that mostly denotate ethnic groups of the Caucasus and the names of the respective languages. Many of the referential attributes are also formed by means of the suffix \textit{-an}. Some examples illustrating the usage are given in \refexrange{ex:This is called nature reserve in Russian}{ex:Was he Kumyk No (he) was Dargwa}. As example \refex{ex:This is called nature reserve in Russian} shows, the terms that contain \isi{genitive} suffixes can also be used without  head \isi{nouns} (e.g. \tit{ʁaj} \sqt{language} in this examples) if the reference is clear from context.

Some microtoponyms can be found in \reftab{tab:Microtoponyms}. The first column provides the citation form of the name and the second column the essive case form (all other \is{spatial case}spatial cases are formed accordingly). The second column shows that the essive forms are sometimes transparently built from the \tsc{loc}-series (-\textit{le}) and in one case from the \tsc{ad}-series (-\textit{šːu}) \refex{ex:They sent us to Shari it is probably one kilometer}. All terms for microtoponyms do not contain morphemes that synchronically can be identified as \isi{spatial case} suffixes \refex{ex:As I remember they were in Shike}. The third column provides explanations for those place names for which I was able to find one. Unfortunately not all place names are still remembered after more than 50 years since Sanzhi people resettled from their original village to the lowlands.\largerpage
