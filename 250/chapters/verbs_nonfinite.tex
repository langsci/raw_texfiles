\chapter{Non-finite verb forms}
\label{cpt:nonfiniteverbforms}

There are three types of verb forms that function as heads of subordinate clauses:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	plain non-finite verb forms (\refsec{sec:Plain non-finite verb forms})
	\item	verb forms functioning as specialized converbs (\refsec{cpt:specializedconverbssubordinatingenclitics})
		\item	\isi{conditional} and \isi{concessive} verb forms (\refsec{cpt:conditionalconcessiveclauses})
\end{itemize}

Plain non-finite verb forms are simple converbs, \is{participle}participles, the \isi{infinitive}, the \isi{subjunctive}, and the \isi{masdar}. The specialized converbs convey more specific temporal and causal relationships. Plain non-finite verb forms (except for the \isi{subjunctive}) and constructions with specialized converbs lack \isi{person agreement}. Only the plain non-finite verb forms are part of the inflectional paradigm of the verb and thus formed by suffixes. Some of them are also used for the formation of analytic TAM forms. By contrast, verb forms functioning as specialized converbs mostly employ enclitics, which can also be added to other parts of speech than verbs. Conditional and \isi{concessive} clauses have \isi{person agreement} expressed by suffixes that strongly resemble the suffixes used in synthetic verb forms of main clauses. They are treated here as non-finite verb forms because their basic use is restricted to dependent clauses that cannot syntactically function as  main clauses. All non-finite verb forms are normally negated by adding the negative prefix \tit{a-}.

Conditional and \isi{concessive} forms as well as specialized converbs and some of the plain non-finite verb forms occur in \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses (\refcpt{cpt:Syntactic properties of adverbial and conditional clauses}). Complement clauses (\refcpt{cpt:Complementation}) are mostly headed by plain non-finite forms such as the \isi{infinitive} and the \isi{masdar}, and \is{relative clause}relative clauses are formed with \is{participle}participles (\refcpt{cpt:Relative clauses}).

\section{Plain non-finite verb forms}
\label{sec:Plain non-finite verb forms}

The following verb forms are considered to be plain non-finite verb forms:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	simple converbs (imperfective and perfective) (\refsec{sssec:The imperfective converb} and \refsec{sssec:The perfective converb})
	\item	\is{participle}participles (preterite, modal and functionally related forms with \tit{-il} and \tit{-ce/-te}, and the \isi{locative participle}) (\refsec{ssec:Participles and functionally related verb forms})
	\item	\isi{infinitive} (\refsec{ssec:The infinitive})
	\item	\isi{subjunctive}, i.e., agreeing \isi{infinitive} (\refsec{ssec:The subjunctive (agreeing infinitive)})
	\item	\isi{masdar} (\refsec{ssec:The masdar})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simple converbs}
\label{ssec:Simple converbs}
Like all Dargwa languages, Sanzhi has two simple converbs, an \isi{imperfective converb} (\refsec{sssec:The imperfective converb}) and a \isi{perfective converb} (\refsec{sssec:The perfective converb}). For the syntax of \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses in which these converbs occur see \refcpt{cpt:Syntactic properties of adverbial and conditional clauses}.


\subsubsection{The imperfective converb}
\label{sssec:The imperfective converb}

The \isi{imperfective converb} has the suffix \tit{-ul} (occasionally also \tit{-ule}) or with a few verbs, which have -\textit{un} as the suffix for the \isi{perfective converb}, \tit{-un(ne)}. For other Dargwa varieties \tit{-ul} has been analyzed as diachronically composed of \tit{-u} (the stem augment that is used for the \isi{habitual present}) and a converb suffix \tit{-l} \citep{Sumbatova.Mutalov2003, BelyaevInPreparation}, and it is probable that this analysis can be applied to Sanzhi Dargwa as well. The suffix \tit{-unne} is also diachronically complex, consisting of \tit{-un-ne}. The second part -\textit{ne} is an allomorph of the converb suffix -\textit{le} that is also used for the formation of the \isi{perfective converb} (\refsec{sssec:The perfective converb}) and, more generally, as an \isi{adverbializer} (\refsec{ssec:The adverbializer -le}). However, synchronically the \isi{imperfective converb} is not complex anymore and I will therefore gloss it as one single morpheme.

The \isi{imperfective converb} can only be formed from imperfective stems and from stems of which the aspect is not specified.
%
The functional range of the \isi{imperfective converb} is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	formation of the compound present by adding the person enclitics \refex{I am going to sell sunflower seeds.} or the \isi{copula} (\refsec{ssec:Compound present}) and formation of the compound past by adding the past \isi{enclitic} (\refsec{ssec:Compound past}). In \is{interrogative clause}interrogative clauses the enclitics and copulas can be omitted under certain circumstances and only the interrogative enclitics occur \refex{ex:What is your wife saying, is she not coming} (\refsec{sec:Predicative particles}). There are also a \isi{number} of other auxiliaries that co-occur with imperfective converbs in \is{periphrastic verb form}periphrastic verb forms (\refcpt{cpt:Periphrastic verb forms}).
	%
	\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{I am going to sell sunflower seeds.}
	\gll žimiška	d-ic-ij			arg-ul=da\\
	sunflower.seeds \tsc{npl}-sell.\tsc{pfv-inf}	go.\tsc{ipfv-icvb}=1 \\
	\glt	\sqt{I am going to sell sunflower seeds.}

		\ex	\label{ex:What is your wife saying, is she not coming}
		\gll	ala	xːunul ce	r-ik'-ul=e?	saˁ-q'-unne=kːu=w?\\
			\tsc{2sg.gen}	woman what	\tsc{f-}say\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=q}	\tsc{hither}-go-\tsc{icvb=neg=q}\\
		\glt	\sqt{What is your wife saying? Is she not coming?}
	\end{exe}

	\item	formation of \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses expressing temporal simultaneity or precedence of the event in the \isi{adverbial clause} with the event expressed in the main clause \refex{ex:We were going there to the goat canyon, but did not arrive there}, \refex{ex:I did not do a difficult work, driving, bringing the workers (to the wine factory) and bringing them back}. This use is very frequent in texts and includes the use in manner clauses that denote the way in which an event is occurring or the manner in which an action is carried out \refex{ex:Then Patima appeared outside running}.
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:We were going there to the goat canyon, but did not arrive there}
		\gll	[q'aca-la	neqːe	hextːu	arg-ul],	či-a-ha-d-eʁ-ib=da\\
			he.goat\tsc{-gen}	canyon.\tsc{loc}	there.\tsc{up}	go\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{spr-neg-up}\tsc{-1/2pl-}go\tsc{.pfv-pret=1}\\
		\glt	\sqt{We were going there to the goat canyon, but did not arrive there.}
	
		\ex	\label{ex:I did not do a difficult work, driving, bringing the workers (to the wine factory) and bringing them back}
		\gll	guž	ʡaˁči	a-b-arq'-ib=da,	[w-ax-ul],	[raboči	b-ik-ul]	[sa-b-ik-ul]\\
			difficult	work	\tsc{neg-n-}do\tsc{.pfv-pret=1}	\tsc{m-}go\tsc{-icvb} workers	\tsc{hpl-}lead\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{hither}\tsc{-hpl-}lead\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}\\
		\glt	\sqt{I did not do difficult work, driving, bringing the workers (to the wine factory) and bringing them back.}
	
		\ex	\label{ex:Then Patima appeared outside running}
		\gll	c'il	hel-ka	[duc'	r-ik'-ul]	tːura-r-ič-ib	ca-r	Pat'ima\\
			then	that\tsc{-abl}	run	\tsc{f-}move\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{out}\tsc{-f-}occur\tsc{.pfv-pret}	\tsc{cop-f}	Patima\\
		\glt	\sqt{Then Patima appeared outside running. (i.e. ran outside)}
	\end{exe}
	
There are plenty of examples in which it is not easy or even impossible to unambiguously identify the main clause to which the converbal clause belongs such that it may seem that the converb can head independent main clauses. In fact, such usages have been reported for Mehweb Dargwa (\citet{Kustova2015}; see also \citet{Mithun2008} for a more general account of how and why non-finite verb forms develop into finite verb forms and the use of dependent clauses as independent sentences). However, in elicitation converb clauses are always judged as dependent clauses that need to be related to a superordinate clause in order to form a grammatical sentence. Thus, converb clauses that seem to occur on their own in independent utterances can probably be treated as a feature of colloquial language. In \refex{ex:‎There was bread one for everyone, whatever} only the first clause is morphosyntactically unambiguously an independent main clause followed by two expressions that indicate the lack of knowledge of the speaker (\textit{ce ca-d=de=l, aχːu}) and two clauses with imperfective converbs without accompanying main clauses.

For instance, the utterance in \refex{ex:‎‎hitting with the crook, disturbing, beating up} is part of a characterization of a person, but there is no preceding or following main clause that could serve as a syntactic anchor for the \isi{adverbial clause}.
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:‎There was bread one for everyone, whatever}
		\gll	ca	ca	t'ult'=de=w?	ce	ca-d=de=l,	aχːu,	[ču-la	le-b-il	sa-b-iqː-ul]	[lukː-unne]\\

		\glt	\sqt{‎There was one bread for everyone? Whatever, I don't know, what they had they were bringing (to the soldiers) and giving it to them.}
	
		\ex	\label{ex:‎‎hitting with the crook, disturbing, beating up}

		\glt	\sqt{‎‎hitting with the crook, disturbing, beating up, \ldots}
	\end{exe}

	\item	formation of certain complement clauses, for instance with the verb \sqt{begin}\linebreak (\refsec{ssec:The imperfective converb}), i.e. the verbal head in the complement clause bears the \isi{imperfective converb} suffix.

	\item	The \isi{imperfective converb} of the verb \tit{b-ik'ʷ-} \sqt{say} is used as a quotation marker and, more generally, as a marker of certain complement clauses (\refsec{ssec:The quotative particles}).

\subsubsection{The perfective converb}
\label{sssec:The perfective converb}

The \isi{perfective converb} is formed by adding the suffix \tit{-le} to the \isi{preterite participle}. The resulting complex suffixes are \tit{-ib-le, -ub-le, -un-ne,} and \tit{-ur-re} (or \tit{-ur-le}), and their distribution is lexicalized (see the tables in \refsec{sec:The structure underived verbal stems} for many example verbs). The suffix -\textit{le} is a \isi{cross-categorical suffix} that forms adverbials from various parts of speech (\refsec{ssec:The adverbializer -le}). The \isi{perfective converb} is mainly built from perfective verb stems. Thus, what is treated in this grammar under the label ``\isi{perfective converb}'' is a conflation of several components that come with their own properties. It is therefore not ideal to gloss only the suffix -\textit{le} as \isi{perfective converb} (\tsc{cvb}) because this suffix only contributes to the morphosyntax, but not to the semantics. The meaning of the \isi{perfective converb} originates from the combination of a (usually) perfective verb stem with the preterite suffix.

The functions of the \isi{perfective converb} are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Formation of \is{analytic verb form}analytic verb forms: \isi{resultative} (\refsec{ssec:The (perfective) resultative}), perfect (\refsec{ssec:The perfect}) and past perfect (\refsec{ssec:The past perfect (pluperfect)}). Furthermore, there are \is{periphrastic verb form}periphrastic verb forms with other auxiliaries that make use of the \isi{perfective converb} (\refcpt{cpt:Periphrastic verb forms}).

	\item	Formation of temporal \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses: The \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses refer to situations that take place before the situation expressed in the main clause or simultaneously with it \refex{ex:‎He got happy, caught his frog, and wants to go home}, \refex{ex:‎He went and complained}. Occasionally, the latter type of converb clauses, which express simultaneously occurring events, are semantically manner clauses \refex{ex:‎He himself run away}. It is common to have sequences of \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses containing perfective converbs that denote a sequence of events \refex{ex:‎He got happy, caught his frog, and wants to go home}. As with the \isi{imperfective converb}, it is not always easy to find an adjacent main clause that is the syntactic anchor for \isi{perfective converb} clauses. For instance, in \refex{ex:we plaster the house, hang the wallpaper, put the windows; the boards were already prepared} the \isi{copula} clause at the end refers to the same stretch of events that the preceding converbal clauses refer to, namely the building of a house. However, the converb clauses and the \isi{copula} clauses do not share any arguments. The sharing of arguments is not a syntactic requirement for the use of perfective converbs, but as the preceding examples \xxref{ex:‎He got happy, caught his frog, and wants to go home}{ex:‎He himself run away} show it is very common (see also \refsec{ssec:Co-reference and expression of shared arguments} for more information about the syntactic properties of converbal clauses with respect to argument sharing).

		\glt	\sqt{We plastered the house, hung the wallpaper, put the windows; the boards were already prepared.}
	\end{exe}

	\item	Formation of complement clauses: the \isi{perfective converb} occurs in a range of complement clauses of the fact and of the activity type with cognition, evaluation and emotion predicates and with the verb \sqt{finish} in the matrix clause \refex{ex:‎I remember that he came riding on a horsePFVCVB} (\refsec{ssec:The preterite converb}).

\subsection{Participles}
\label{ssec:Participles and functionally related verb forms}

Participles and functionally related forms occur in \is{relative clause}relative clauses and partially also in other constructions. Sanzhi has three \isi{participle}: (i) the \isi{preterite participle} (\refsec{sssec:The preterite participle}), (ii) the \isi{modal participle} (\refsec{sssec:The modal participle -an}), and (iii) the \isi{locative participle} (\refsec{sssec:The locative participle}). To the first two \is{participle}participles the cross-cateogorical suffixes -\textit{ce} and -\textit{il} can be added (\refsec{sssec:The attributive markers -il and -ce / -te in combination with the participles}). For the syntactic properties of \is{relative clause}relative clauses see \refcpt{cpt:Relative clauses}.

\subsubsection{The preterite participle}
\label{sssec:The preterite participle}

The preterite is used for a range of verb forms with past time reference that are used in main clauses. This includes the preterite itself (\refsec{ssec:The preterite}) but also many more analytic (\refsec{sec:Forms based on the preterite}) and \is{periphrastic verb form}periphrastic verb forms based on it (\refcpt{cpt:Periphrastic verb forms}). The preterite is also employed in \is{relative clause}relative clauses (\refcpt{cpt:Relative clauses}). Formally we deal with one and the same suffix, and I will therefore use only one single gloss for it (\tsc{pret}), although functionally and with respect to morphosyntactic properties the finite verb form `preterite' differs from the \isi{participle}. The finite verb form is used together with person enclitics, the past \isi{enclitic} or the \isi{copula}, which, by contrast, is impossible for the \isi{participle} in a \isi{relative clause}. The \isi{participle}, in turn, attaches further nominalizing suffixes \refex{ex:Give me the one that is hanging} and can then be case marked (\refsec{sec:Headless relative clauses}). Relative clauses that are formed with the \isi{preterite participle} obligatorily have a nominal head \refex{ex:These are clothes that have been hung up there}, \refex{ex:‎He is remembering his gone by, past life}. 


\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:These are clothes that have been hung up there}
	\gll	hex-tːi	[sa-r-ha-aq-ib]	paltar	ca-d\\
		\tsc{dem.up}\tsc{-pl}	\tsc{ante-abl-up}-hang\tsc{.pfv-pret}	clothes	\tsc{cop-npl}\\
	\glt	\sqt{These are clothes that have been hung up there.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎He is remembering his gone by, past life}
	\gll	han	d-irč-aq-ul	ca-d	cin-na	[b-it-ag-ur],	[ag-ur]	ʡuˁnru\\
		remember	\tsc{npl-}occur\tsc{.ipfv-caus-icvb}	\tsc{cop-npl}	\tsc{refl.sg-gen}	\tsc{n-thither}-go\tsc{.pfv-pret}	go\tsc{.pfv-pret}	life\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎He is remembering his gone by, past life.}
\end{exe}

The \isi{preterite participle} cannot directly take case suffixes or similar grammatical markers used with nominals \refex{ex:ungrammaticalGive me the one that is hanging}. In order to nominalize the \isi{preterite participle}, one of the cross-categorical \is{participle}participles \tit{-il} \refex{ex:Give me the one that is hanging} or \tit{-ce} needs to be added (see \refsec{sssec:The attributive markers -il and -ce / -te in combination with the participles} below for more details).

\begin{exe}
	\ex[*]{	\label{ex:ungrammaticalGive me the one that is hanging}
	\gll	dam	b-iqː-a	sa-r-ha-aq-ib!\\
		\tsc{1sg.dat}		\tsc{n-}take\tsc{.ipfv-imp}	\tsc{ante-abl-up}-hang\tsc{.pfv-pret}\\
	\glt	(Intended meaning: \sqt{Give me the one that is hanging!})}

	\ex[]{	\label{ex:Give me the one that is hanging}
	\gll	dam	b-iqː-a	sa-r-ha-aq-ib-il!\\
		\tsc{1sg.dat}		\tsc{n-}take\tsc{.ipfv-imp}	\tsc{ante-abl-up}-hang\tsc{.pfv-pret-ref}\\
	\glt	\sqt{Give me the one that is hanging!} (E)}
\end{exe}

The \isi{preterite participle} also attaches a \isi{number} of temporal enclitics, suffixes and other subordinating enclitics such as \tit{-er} \sqt{when},  \tit{-la} \sqt{since, after} \refex{ex:After that had happened their friendship did not finish.}, \tit{=qːel(la)} \sqt{when, because} and \tit{=xːar} \sqt{although} and is then used in \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses with various specialized converbs (\refsec{cpt:specializedconverbssubordinatingenclitics}).


\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:After that had happened their friendship did not finish.}
	\gll	il	ag-ur-ra	hitːi=ra	ʡaˁχuˁl-dex	taman	a-b-iχ-ub\\
		that	go.\tsc{pfv-pret-post}	after=\tsc{add} guest-\tsc{nmlz}	end	\tsc{neg-b}-happen.\tsc{pfv-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{After that had happened their friendship did not finish.}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{The modal participle \tit{-an}}
\label{sssec:The modal participle -an}

The \isi{modal participle} \tit{-an} is only added to imperfective stems. Its semantics covers modality (obligation, deontic necessity) and future time reference. However, in \is{relative clause}relative clauses the modal meaning is often absent. The \isi{modal participle} is used for the formation of a range of finite \is{analytic verb form}analytic verb forms, namely future (\refsec{ssec:Future analytic}), future in the past (\refsec{ssec:Future in the past}), obligative (\refsec{ssec:Obligative}), obligative present (\refsec{ssec:Obligative present}), and obligative past (\refsec{ssec:Obligative past}). The second functional domain of the \isi{modal participle} is the formation of \is{relative clause}relative clauses. They mostly have habitual semantics and refer to stable properties of the referent of the head noun \xxref{ex:We are people who were working}{ex:‎‎‎For the one who wants to quarrel there is always an option}. Thus, there are some \is{participle}participles that have been lexicalized into \isi{adjectives} expressing characteristic properties, e.g. \tit{b-uz b-ik'ʷ-an barcːik'ʷ} (\tsc{n-}tear \tsc{n-aux.ipfv-ptcp} chudu) \sqt{chudu filled with cheese that can be expanded and stretched when it is melted}, \textit{dircan} `trader, seller' \refex{ex:The one who is seated is probably selling (stuff)}.

		\glt	\sqt{We are people, people who work.} (i.e. we are worth to be respected)

		\ex	\label{ex:the boy called MahammadhazhiVerbs}
		\gll	hel	[Maħaˁmmadħaˁži	b-ik'ʷ-an]	durħuˁ\\

When the \isi{modal participle} is followed by the \isi{cross-categorical suffix} \tit{-ce} it also occurs in complement clauses \refex{ex:‎‎I know that he will come.PTCPAn} (\refsec{ssec:The attributive marker -ce (-te)COMPL}), in addition to the possible use in headless \is{relative clause}relative clauses (\refsec{sec:Headless relative clauses}). The second \isi{cross-categorical suffix} \tit{-il} also often co-occurs with the \isi{modal participle} in various \is{relative clause}relative clauses. 


\begin{exe}

\subsubsection{The cross-categorical suffixes \tit{-il} and \tit{-ce}\slash\tit{-te} in combination with the participles}
\label{sssec:The attributive markers -il and -ce / -te in combination with the participles}

The preterite and the \isi{modal participle} can combine with both types of \is{cross-categorical suffix}cross-categorical suffixes, \tit{-il} and \tit{-ce} (\tit{-te} in the plural). The general function of these suffixes can be described as the formation of referential attributes or definite descriptions that have the morphosyntactic properties of nominals (\refsec{ssec:The -ce / -te attributive} and \refsec{ssec:The -il attributive}). When the suffixes are added to the \is{participle}participles we can form \isi{relative clause} with heads and headless \is{relative clause}relative clauses. Two \is{participle}participles and two types of \is{cross-categorical suffix}cross-categorical suffixes yield four possible combinations that are not all equally common. There seem to be no semantic differences between the two \is{cross-categorical suffix}cross-categorical suffixes when occurring in headless \is{relative clause}relative clauses. But there is a morphosyntactic difference: the suffix \tit{-il} is only used with referents that are not morphologically overtly marked for plural, i.e., the \isi{relative clause} needs to refer to a singular object or a mass noun such as \tit{χalq'} \sqt{people} or \tit{sungul} \sqt{the community of the Sanzhi people} (even though both \isi{nouns} control human plural agreement) or something similar as in \refex{ex:the half (of the people) who were going with me}. The referent can be overtly expressed (\isi{relative clause} with a head) or not (headless \isi{relative clause}). For overtly marked plural referents or for headless \is{relative clause}relative clauses denoting a plurality of referents only \tit{-te} can be used \xxref{ex:the Sanzhi people who are sitting and drinking}{ex:the half (of the people) who were going with me}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:the Sanzhi people who are sitting and drinking}
	\gll	b-učː-ul	*ka-b-iž-ib-il	/	ka-b-iž-ib-te	sunglan-te\\
		\tsc{hpl-}drink\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{down-hpl-}be\tsc{.pfv-pret-ref} 	/	\tsc{down-hpl-}be\tsc{.pfv-pret-dd.pl}	Sanzhi.person\tsc{-pl}\\
	\glt	\sqt{the Sanzhi people who are sitting and drinking} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:the ones who are working PTCP}
	\gll	ʡaˁči-l	b-irq'-an-te	/	*b-irq'-an-il\\
		work\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{hpl-}do\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp-dd.pl}	/	\tsc{hpl-}do\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp-ref}\\
	\glt	\sqt{the ones who are working} (E)
	
		\ex	\label{ex:the half (of the people) who were going with me}
	\gll	il-tːi	[di-cːella	b-alli	b-ax-an-te]	b-abq'i\\
		that-\tsc{pl}	\tsc{1sg-comit}	\tsc{hpl-}together	\tsc{hpl-}go\tsc{-ptcp-dd.pl} 	\tsc{hpl-}half\\
	\glt	\sqt{the half (of the people) who were going with me}
\end{exe}


By far most common in the Sanzhi corpus are headless \is{relative clause}relative clauses in which the verb bears the \isi{preterite participle} suffix plus the suffix \tit{-il} \refex{ex:‎the one where they are sitting and drinking, I put this (picture) somewhere}. When the \isi{dative} case is used, the meaning of the nominalized \isi{relative clause} can be causal (due to the semantics of the \isi{dative} case) such that these clauses rather function as \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses expressing cause or reason \refex{ex:He became sad, in my opinion, he got very sad, because of what he did minor}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎the one where they are sitting and drinking, I put this (picture) somewhere}
	\gll	[b-učː-ul	ka-b-iž-ib-il]	ka-b-išː-ib=da	heltːu	čina=del\\
		\tsc{hpl-}drink\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{down-hpl-}be\tsc{.pfv-pret-ref}	\tsc{down-n-}put\tsc{.pfv-pret=1}	there	where\tsc{=indef}\\
	\glt	\sqt{The one where they are sitting and drinking, I put this (picture) somewhere.}
\end{exe}

\begin{exe}	
	\ex	\label{ex:He became sad, in my opinion, he got very sad, because of what he did minor}
	\gll	hej	pašman	∅-iχ-ub	ca-w	ʡaˁħ-le	hel	b-arq'-ib-il-li-j	\\
		this	sad	\tsc{m-}be\tsc{.pfv-pret}	\tsc{cop-m}	good\tsc{-advz}	that	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.pfv-pret-ref-obl-dat}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎He got very (lit. well) sad, because of what he had done.}

\end{exe}

The \isi{preterite participle} of the verb \sqt{say} to which \tit{-il} is added and which is used without the spatial \isi{preverb} \textit{ha}- (i.e. \tit{ʔ-ib-il}, also written as \tit{ibil}\footnote{The usual participial form of this verb is \tit{haʔ-ib-il} with the spatial \isi{preverb}.}) functions as marker for \isi{ordinal numerals} \refex{ex:in the year (19)59} (\refsec{sec:ordinalnumerals}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:in the year (19)59}
	\gll	xu-c'anu	urč'em-ra	ibil	dusːi-cːe-w\\
		five-\tsc{ten}	nine\tsc{-num}	\tsc{ord}	year\tsc{.obl-in-m}\\
	\glt	\sqt{in the year (19)59}
\end{exe}

The co-occurrence of both \is{participle}participles (preterite and modal) with \tit{-ce}\slash\tit{-te} is also common and it is easy to find examples with \refex{ex:‎‎‎The ones that gathered (the food) probably divided it among themselves} and without case suffixes \refex{ex:‎‎Foolish Sanzhi people, crazy Sаnzhi people, at night they eat three times, and during day they stay hungry they said}. There is a clear difference in meaning due to the \is{participle}participles and the aspectual properties of the verb stems. In \refex{ex:‎‎‎The ones that gathered (the food) probably divided it among themselves} the \isi{preterite participle} is used to refer to people who accomplished an action in the past (i.e. they gathered). The \isi{modal participle} in \refex{ex:‎‎Foolish Sanzhi people, crazy Sаnzhi people, at night they eat three times, and during day they stay hungry they said} refers to the Sanzhi people by means of a stative characterization as the ones who eat three times at night and stay hungry during the day, i.e., fulfilling the duties of Muslims during the month of Ramadan.\largerpage[-2]

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎The ones that gathered (the food) probably divided it among themselves}
	\gll	d-erč-ib-t-a-l	ču-j	d-ut'-ib	d-urkː-ar\\
		\tsc{npl-}collect\tsc{.pfv-pret-pl-obl-erg}	\tsc{refl.pl-dat}	\tsc{npl-}divide\tsc{-pret}	\tsc{npl-}find\tsc{.ipfv-prs}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎The ones that gathered (the food) probably divided it among themselves.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎Foolish Sanzhi people, crazy Sаnzhi people, at night they eat three times, and during day they stay hungry they said}
	\gll	``abdal	sungul,		baˁħ	sungul,		dučːe		ʡaˁj-na	b-uk-an-te, 					ari 		kːuš-le		b-ug-an-te'' 							b-ik'-ul\\
		fool	Sanzhi.people	crazy	Sanzhi.people	at.night	three-\tsc{time}	\tsc{hpl-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp-dd.pl} 	during.day	hungry\tsc{-adv}	\tsc{hpl-}stay\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp-dd.pl} 	\tsc{hpl-}say\tsc{.ipfv}\tsc{-icvb}\\
	\glt	\sqt{``‎‎Foolish Sanzhi people, crazy Sаnzhi people, at night they eat three times, and during day they stay hungry,'' they said.}
\end{exe}


The combination of the \isi{modal participle} with \tit{-il} is not particularly frequent; it occurs mostly together with case suffixes as in \refex{ex:‎now for the one who operates her 5000, 50000 rubles}. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎now for the one who operates her 5000, 50000 rubles}
	\gll	hana	cek'u	r-irq'-an-il-li-j	xujal	azir	xu-c'al	azir\\
		now	whatchamacallit	\tsc{f-}do\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp-ref-obl-dat}	five	thousand	five-\tsc{ten}	thousand\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎now for the one who operates her 5000, 50000 rubles (need to be given)}
\end{exe}

Finally, the suffix \tit{-il} can also be added to the existential copulas, which do not inflect for any of the \is{participle}participles, in order to form headed and headless \is{relative clause}relative clauses \refex{ex:‎There was bread one for everyone, whatever}. In \refex{ex:‎My dear, may on the place where you (fem.) are rain the rain of happiness} the \isi{existential copula} with its suffix -\textit{il} is inflected for a \isi{spatial case}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎My dear, may on the place where you (fem.) are rain the rain of happiness}
	\gll	durqa-ce,	u	le-r-il-le	taliħ-la	marka	b-arq'-ab\\
		dear\tsc{-dd.sg}	\tsc{2sg}	exist\tsc{-f-ref-loc}	happiness\tsc{-gen}	rain	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.pfv-opt.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{(‎My) dear, may onto the place where you (fem.) are rain the rain of happiness.}
\end{exe}

\subsubsection{The locative participle \textit{-na}}
\label{sssec:The locative participle}

The \isi{locative participle} has the suffix \tit{-an}. It is only available for imperfective verb stems. It has a spatial meaning that corresponds to the semantics of the lative case (\refsec{ssec:Functions of semantic cases}). Similar to \is{spatial adverb}spatial adverbs it can take further \isi{spatial case} suffixes, i.e. the essive and the \isi{ablative}. It most commonly functions as the head of spatial \is{relative clause}relative clauses \refex{ex:‎He wanted to go his way (where he is going)}, \refex{ex:‎‎I did not go through where the people (normally) go, but through where the hill is}, but it is also possible to add a head noun \refex{ex:‎‎‎The boys went to the place where cows are slaughtered}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎He wanted to go his way (where he is going)}
	\gll	∅-uq'-ij	b-ikː-ul=de	il-i-j	[cin-na	w-ax-na]\\
		\tsc{m-}go\tsc{-inf}	\tsc{n-}want\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=pst}	that\tsc{-obl-dat}	\tsc{refl.sg-gen}	\tsc{m-}go\tsc{-ptcp.loc}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎He wanted to go his way.} (lit. where he goes)

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎I did not go through where the people (normally) go, but through where the hill is}
	\gll	het	[χalq'	b-ax-na-r]	a-ag-ur-re,	c'il	tum-la	hetːu-r	ag-ur=da\\
		that	people	\tsc{hpl-}go\tsc{-ptcp.loc-abl}	\tsc{neg-}go\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb}	then	hill-\tsc{gen}	there\tsc{-abl}	go\tsc{.pfv-pret=1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎I did not go through where the people (normally) go, but through where the hill is.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎The boys went to the place where cows are slaughtered}
	\gll	durħ-ne	ag-ur	[q'ʷal	luχ-na]	musːa\\
		boy\tsc{-pl}	go\tsc{.pfv-pret}	cow	cut\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp.loc}	place.\tsc{loc}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎The boys went to the place where cows are slaughtered.} (this refers to a specific place in Sanzhi)
\end{exe}

In addition, the \isi{locative participle} can be fully case marked. In order to add case suffixes (other than the suffixes for the essive and the \isi{ablative}) the \isi{participle} appears in its oblique forms, just like any other nominal. After suffixing the oblique marker \tit{-l} (which is identical to the \isi{ergative}), case suffixes follow \refex{ex:‎‎‎Where Napisat was sleeping there was a snake}. But as \refex{ex:‎‎I did not go through where the people (normally) go, but through where the hill is} and the second variant in \refex{ex:‎‎‎Where Napisat was sleeping there was a snake} show, it is also allowed to directly suffix markers that express the \is{spatial case}spatial cases essive, lative and \isi{ablative}, because the \isi{locative participle} has inherent spatial meaning. In elicitation, the suffixation of other than \is{spatial case}spatial cases leads to a broader variety of \is{relative clause}relative clauses \refex{ex:‎ ‎‎There was the gossip that Maja was lying}. The case-marked \isi{participle} also occurs in \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses with \isi{causative} semantics \refex{ex:ecause Maja was sleeping I (masc.) could not come.}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎Where Napisat was sleeping there was a snake}
	\gll	[Napisat	ka-r-ils-na-l-le-b	/	ka-r-ils-na-b]	te-b=de	maˁlʡuˁn\\
		Napisat	\tsc{down-f-}sleep\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp.loc-obl-loc-n}	/ \tsc{down-f-}sleep\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp.loc-n}	exist\tsc{.away}-\tsc{n=pst}	snake\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎Where Napisat was sleeping there was a snake.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:‎ ‎‎There was the gossip that Maja was lying}
	\gll	[Maˁʡaˁ	ka-r-ils-na-l-la]	χabar	le-b=de\\
		Maja	\tsc{down-f-}sleep\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp.loc-obl-gen}	story	exist\tsc{-n=pst}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎There was the gossip that Maja was lying (in the hospital).} (E)
\end{exe}

\subsection{The infinitive}
\label{ssec:The infinitive}

The suffix for the \isi{infinitive} is \tit{-ij}. It is very likely that the final \tit{j} diachronically goes back to the \isi{dative} case, and the formal identity of infinite and \isi{dative} case is also attested in other Dargwa languages (e.g. Tanti, Icari) and other East Caucasian languages such as Hinuq. In principle, the \isi{infinitive} can be formed from imperfective and perfective stems \refex{ex:infinitiveexamples} but in natural texts it is almost exclusively used with perfective stems. There are a \isi{number} of imperfective verbs for which the \isi{infinitive} is at least very marginal if not ungrammatical (see the last two examples in \refex{ex:infinitiveexamples}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:infinitiveexamples}
	\begin{xlist}
		\TabPositions{8em,9em,17em}
		\ex	\tit{ha-b-ilq'-ij} (\tsc{ipfv}) 	\tab	/	\tab 	\tit{habiq'ij} (\tsc{pfv}) 		\tab	\sqt{raise, keep up}
		\ex	\tit{lukː-ij} (\tsc{ipfv}) 		\tab	/	\tab  	\tit{b-ičː-ij} (\tsc{pfv}) 		\tab	\sqt{give}

	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}\pagebreak

The functions of the bare \isi{infinitive} are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	formation of purpose clauses 
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:‎We put it (on the table) to eat}
		\gll	hel	sa-ka-b-iršː-id	b-erkʷ-ij\\
			that	\tsc{hither-down-n-}put\tsc{.ipfv-1.prs}	\tsc{n-}eat\tsc{.pfv-inf}\\
		\glt	\sqt{‎We put it (on the table) to eat.}
	\end{exe}

	\item	formation of complement clauses with different types of \is{complement-taking predicate}complement-taking predicates (volitional, modal, phasal, manipulative, etc.). The complement clauses have potential or activity meaning (\refsec{ssec:Infinitive and subjunctive}). In \refex{ex:There is what I want to say} the infinitival complement clause is embedded into a headless \isi{relative clause} formed with the \isi{modal participle} -\textit{an}.
	%
	\begin{exe}
	
				\ex	\label{ex:‎‎I was not able to move (lit. shake) (my legs)}
	\gll	[hak'	d-arq'-ij]	a-r-iχ-ub=da\\
		shake	\tsc{npl-}do\tsc{.pfv-inf}	\tsc{neg-f-}be.able\tsc{.pfv-pret=1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎I (fem.) was not able to move (lit. shake) (my legs).}
	
	
		\ex	\label{ex:There is what I want to say}
		\gll	le-b=q'al	[dam	[b-urs-ij]	b-ikː-an]\\
			exist\tsc{-n=prt}	\tsc{1sg.dat}	\tsc{n-}say\tsc{.pfv-inf}	\tsc{n-}want\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp}\\
		\glt	\sqt{There exists what I want to say.}
			
	\end{exe}
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the \isi{infinitive} can take a \isi{number} of suffixes and enclitics:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(i)]	the \isi{cross-categorical suffix} \tit{-ce}\slash\tit{-te} for the formation of complement clauses with potential meaning and purpose clauses \refex{ex:‎There is something to eat and to drink}. Note that in this function the suffix can also be omitted without any change in meaning (i.e. compare with \refex{ex:‎We put it (on the table) to eat}).
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:‎There is something to eat and to drink}
		\gll	na	d-erčː-ij-te	d-erkʷ-ij-te	li<d>il	cik'al	le-d\\
			now	\tsc{npl-}drink\tsc{.pfv-inf-dd.pl} 	\tsc{npl-}eat\tsc{.pfv-inf-dd.pl} 	all\tsc{<pl>}	something	exist\tsc{-npl}\\
		\glt	\sqt{‎There is something to eat and to drink.}
	\end{exe}

	\item[(ii)]	the complementizer\slash \isi{embedded question marker} \tit{=al} for the formation of embedded polar and content \isi{questions} \refex{ex:I do not remember how it is called} and very occasionally for rhetoric \isi{questions} for which the speaker does not expect an answer \refex{ex:‎How is this possible, they four and we also in one car}. The latter use is due to the ongoing grammaticalization of the embedded question \isi{enclitic} as a marker of epistemic modality (\refsec{sec:Subordinate questions}).
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:I do not remember how it is called}
		\gll	it-i-j	aχːu	han	b-el	akːu	[ce	b-ik'ʷ-ij=al]\\

		\glt	\sqt{I do not remember how to call it.}

		\ex	\label{ex:‎How is this possible, they four and we also in one car}
		\gll	cet'-le	b-iχʷ-ij=al,	aʁʷal	itːi=ra	nušːa=ra	mašin-ni-cːella\\

		\glt	\sqt{‎How is this possible, they four and we also in one car.}
	\end{exe}
	
	\item[(iii)]	subordinating enclitics for the formation of \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses, e.g. \tit{=sat}\slash\tit{=satːin}\slash\tit{= satːinna} \sqt{until}, \tit{=sar} \sqt{before, until} and \tit{bahandan} \sqt{because of} (\refsec{cpt:specializedconverbssubordinatingenclitics})

	\item[(iv)]	the suffix \tit{-li-j} (\tsc{-obl-dat}): the \isi{dative} is generally used to express causes (\refsec{sssec:Dative}), and it is the only case that the \isi{infinitive} can be inflected for \refex{ex:‎‎You tell him, I said silently like this, such that Kurban cannot hear it}. In the \isi{causative} function the \isi{dative} is also suffixed to other deverbal nominals such as abstracts \isi{nouns} with the suffix \tit{-dex} and the \isi{masdar} (\refsec{ssec:The masdar}).
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:‎‎You tell him, I said silently like this, such that Kurban cannot hear it}
		\gll	``u-l	b-urs-a!''		haʔ-ib=da	qːant'-le	caj-na	cara	daˁʡaˁn-ne		[Q'urban-ni	t'am	a-d-aq'-ij-li-j		heχ-itːe]\\

		\glt	\sqt{``‎‎You tell him!'' I said briefly once more such that Kurban could not hear it.}

\subsection{The subjunctive (i.e. agreeing infinitive)}
\label{ssec:The subjunctive (agreeing infinitive)}

Sanzhi Dargwa has another verb form that is functionally equivalent to the \isi{infinitive}, but shows \isi{person agreement}, and will be called ``\isi{subjunctive}'' in this grammar. Person agreement of the \isi{subjunctive} is reduced in comparison to other verb forms such as the \isi{habitual present} or the \isi{habitual past}. There is no suffix for the first person and instead the normal \isi{infinitive} is used. The suffixes for the second and the third person, which do not distinguish \isi{number}, are displayed in \reftab{tab:subjunctive}. The second person makes use of the same stem augment vowels (\textit{i}, \textit{u}) that occur with other verb forms such as the \isi{habitual present} or the \isi{prohibitive}.\footnote{The second person \isi{subjunctive} suffixes are identical in form with variants of the plural \isi{prohibitive}.} Diachronically, the suffixes \tit{-itːaj}\slash\tit{-utːaj} consist of the stem augment, followed by a second person suffix -\textit{tː}, and the last part -\textit{aj}, which represents the actual \isi{subjunctive} marker. This becomes clear when we compare the \isi{subjunctive} to other verb forms (\refsec{sec:Person agreement}). However, for the sake of understanding I treat the suffixes as units and use a single gloss.


\begin{table}
	\caption{The subjunctive}
	\label{tab:subjunctive}
	\small
	\begin{tabularx}{0.40\textwidth}[]{%
		>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{10pt}
		>{\centering\arraybackslash}X
		>{\centering\arraybackslash}X}
		
		\lsptoprule
			{}	&	singular	&	plural\\
		\midrule
			1	&	\tmd		&	\tmd\\

			3	&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\tit{-araj\slash -anaj}}\\
		\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

There is a strong correlation between the stem augment vowel and transitivity, i.e. \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs mostly take \tit{-u} \refex{ex:subjunctivecryeatgosleep} and transitive and \is{affective verb}affective verbs usually take \mbox{\tit{-i}} \refex{ex:subjunctivetellseebringlead}. Thus, the \isi{subjunctive} behaves as other verb forms that have \isi{person agreement} suffixes (\refsec{sec:Person agreement}). 



\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:subjunctivecryeatgosleep}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{r-isː-utːaj} \sqt{cry} 
		\ex	\tit{r-uk-utːaj} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{eat}
		\ex	\tit{r-uq'-uˁtːaj} \sqt{go}
		\ex	\tit{ka-r-isː-utːaj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{lie, sleep}
	\end{xlist}

	\ex	\label{ex:subjunctivetellseebringlead}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{b-urs-itːaj} \sqt{tell}
		\ex	\tit{či-b-až-itːaj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{see}
		\ex	\tit{r-ič-itːaj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{bring, lead}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

In the third person, the suffixes \tit{-ar-aj} and \tit{-an-aj} are used, which diachronically consist of \tit{-ar} (homophone to one allomorph of the the \isi{habitual present} and the realis \isi{conditional}), or \tit{-an} (homophone to the \isi{modal participle}) and \tit{-aj}. The choice between \tit{-araj} and \tit{-anaj} is mostly lexicalized \refex{ex:subjunctivecrydobekill}, \refex{ex:subjunctiveliewriteeatsupport} but there are a few verbs to which in elicitation both suffixes can be attached, e.g.  \tit{či-ha-b-uq-anaj}\slash\tit{či-ha-b-uq-araj} (\tsc{spr-up}\tsc{-n-}go\tsc{.pfv-subj.3}) \sqt{climb}. In general, \tit{-anaj} is more common both in terms of types (i.e. verb stems to which the suffix is added) as well as in terms of token frequency in my corpus.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:subjunctivecrydobekill}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{r-isː-araj} \sqt{cry}
		\ex	\tit{b-arq'-araj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{do}
		\ex	\tit{b-iχʷ-araj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{be, become, can}
		\ex	\tit{kaxʷ-araj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{kill}
	\end{xlist}

	\ex	\label{ex:subjunctiveliewriteeatsupport}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{ka-b-isː-anaj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{lie, sleep}
		\ex	\tit{b-elk'-anaj} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{write}
		\ex	\tit{b-uk-anaj} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{eat}
		\ex	\tit{ha-b-irq'-anaj} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{support, bring up, make high}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The \isi{subjunctive}, just like the \isi{infinitive}, is mainly obtained from perfective stems, though a \isi{number} of imperfective stems can also be inflected for it \refex{ex:subjunctiveexamples}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:subjunctiveexamples}
	\begin{xlist}
		\TabPositions{9em,10em,19em}
		\ex	\tit{ha-b-ilq'-araj} (\tsc{ipfv}) 	\tab	/	\tab 	\tit{habiq'-araj} (\tsc{pfv}) 	\tab	\sqt{raise, keep up}
		\ex	\tit{lukː-araj} (\tsc{ipfv}) 		\tab	/	\tab 	\tit{b-ikː-araj} (\tsc{pfv}) 		\tab	\sqt{give}

	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}


The functions of the \isi{subjunctive} are identical to the functions of the normal \isi{infinitive} and it is always possible to replace the \isi{subjunctive} with the \isi{infinitive}. Thus, the \isi{subjunctive} heads purpose and complement clauses:

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎Then there at the school, there is a place, if it still exists, for you to sleep}
	\gll	c'il	uškul-la		hextːu-b,		musːa=ra		k'e-b b-iχʷ-ar				ka-d-isː-utːaj	\\
		then	school\tsc{-gen}	there\tsc{.up-n}	place\tsc{=add}	exist\tsc{.up-n}		\tsc{n-}be\tsc{.pfv-cond.3}	\tsc{down-1/2.pl-}sleep\tsc{.pfv-subj.2}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎Then there at the school, there is a place, if it still exists, for you to sleep.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎The roads to go there were probably bad, for you to go}
	\gll	d-uq'-ij	xːun-be	wahi-l	d-určː-i=q'al	ixtːu	d-uq'-aˁtːaj\\
		\tsc{1/2.pl-}go\tsc{.pfv-inf}	way\tsc{-pl}	bad\tsc{-advz}	\tsc{npl-}be\tsc{.ipfv-hab.pst=mod}	there.\tsc{up}	\tsc{1/2.pl-}go\tsc{.pfv-subj.2}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎The roads to go there were probably bad, for you to go.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎The sister started to eat up the tree so it would come down}
	\gll	hel	rucːi-l	r-aʔ	r-išː-ib	ca-r	b-ukː-un-ne	kːalkːi	ka-b-ik-araj\\
		that	sister\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{f-}begin	\tsc{f-}become\tsc{.pfv-pret}	\tsc{cop-f}	\tsc{n-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	tree	\tsc{down-n-}occur\tsc{.pfv-subj.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎The sister started to eat up the tree so it would come down.}
\end{exe}

As with the \isi{infinitive} it is possible to suffix the \isi{cross-categorical suffix} \tit{-ce} to the \isi{subjunctive} \refex{ex:‎It would be better to build a hospital instead of building a school}. In this example, \tit{b-arq'-araj-ce} could be replaced by \tit{b-arq'-ij-ce} and the meaning would not change.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎It would be better to build a hospital instead of building a school}
	\gll	uškul	b-arq'-araj-ce	balnicːa	b-arq'-ib-le	b-iχʷ-ardel\\
		school	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.pfv-subj.3-dd.sg}	hospital	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb}	\tsc{n-}be\tsc{.pfv-cond.pst}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎It would be better to build a hospital instead of building a school.} (E)
\end{exe}

Furthermore, subordinating enclitics for the formation of \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses can be attached, in particular \tit{=sat}\slash\tit{=satːin}\slash\tit{=satːinna} \sqt{until} \refex{ex:‎‎‎He remained silent, until it became dark he did not tell}, \tit{=sar} \sqt{before, until} and \tit{bahandan} \sqt{because of} (\refsec{cpt:specializedconverbssubordinatingenclitics}):

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎He remained silent, until it became dark he did not tell}
	\gll	k'ʷah	∅-ič-ib-le,	ʁera	ag-araj=sat	a-b-urs-ib\\
		silent	\tsc{m-}occur\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb}	dusk	go\tsc{.pfv-subj.3=}until	\tsc{neg-n-}tell\tsc{.pfv-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎He remained silent, until it became dark he did not tell.}
\end{exe}

It seems that the \isi{subjunctive}, which is absent from the more innovative north Dargwa varieties (e.g. from Akusha\slash Standard Dargwa), is gradually disappearing from south Dargwa varieties. In Icari, it lacks a cell in the transitive paradigm that is replaced with \tit{-ij} (which is not the Icari \isi{infinitive}, but another suffix.). In Sanzhi, it entirely lacks first person forms. Verb forms similar to the Sanzhi \isi{subjunctive} are found in other south Dargwa varieties such as Qunqi, and Xuduc, but, e.g., not in Tanti \citep[136]{Sumbatova.Lander2014}. \citet[107]{Sumbatova.Mutalov2003} write that the Icari \isi{subjunctive} (-\textit{aj}\slash -\textit{j}), which is clearly cognate with the Sanzhi \isi{subjunctive}, is historically and structurally related to the Standard Dargwa \isi{infinitive} -\textit{es}. 




% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

\subsection{The masdar}\label{ssec:The masdar}

The suffix for the \isi{masdar} is \tit{-ni}. It has an allomorph -\textit{ri}, which is only used with a handful of verbs such as the negative form of the \isi{copula} (\tit{(b-)akʷ-ni} and \tit{akːʷ-ri}). The \isi{masdar} is available for imperfective and perfective stems as well as for the \isi{copula} (\tit{ca-b-ni}), and the locative copulas, e.g. \tit{le-b-ni}. The functions of the \isi{masdar} are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	formation of complement clauses, e.g. with matrix predicates such as \sqt{know} and \sqt{understand} \refex{ex:Only for you I sing this song; not knowing whether you got tired}
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:Only for you I sing this song; not knowing whether you got tired}
		\gll	il	at=cun	dalaj	w-ik'-ud,	[w-arc-ni=ra]	a-b-alχ-ul\\
			this	\tsc{2sg.dat=}only	song	\tsc{m-}say\tsc{.ipfv-1.prs}	\tsc{m-}get.tired\tsc{.pfv-msd=add}	\tsc{neg-n-}know\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Only for you I sing this song, not knowing whether you got tired.}
	\end{exe}
	
	If the \isi{masdar} is formed from a stem with \isi{imperfective aspect}, the temporal reference of the complement clause is non-past \refex{ex:I did not know that he dies}, and if it is formed from a stem with \isi{perfective aspect} the temporal reference is past time \refex{ex:I did not know that he died}.
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:I did not know that he dies}
		\gll	ubk'-ni dam a-b-alχ-ul=de\\
			die\tsc{.m.ipfv-msd}	\tsc{1sg.dat}		\tsc{neg-n-}know\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=pst}\\

		\glt	\sqt{I did not know that he died.} (E)
	\end{exe}

	\item	formation of deverbal \isi{nouns} that can be used like other nominals \refex{ex:‎‎‎There was skating on the ice. (referring to a woman skating)}, i.e. in the position of arguments or adjuncts. The \isi{masdar} can be inflected, e.g. for the \isi{dative}, which yields the expected \isi{causative} reading \refex{ex:‎‎‎These (gems) are for you, my friend, because you saved me, said the bear}, and for the \isi{genitive} when it expresses the topic of a speech act \refex{ex:‎‎‎I don't know if I should tell you the story about how we went somewhere} or other relations \refex{ex:What to do, this pasturing (lit. the work of going after the animals) is work}.

\section{Specialized converbs}
\label{cpt:specializedconverbssubordinatingenclitics}

Constructions with special converbs occur in \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses that express temporal or causal relationships. Formally, they mostly consist of an \isi{enclitic} or suffix bearing the specific temporal/causal meaning or of a postposition\slash adverb used to express temporal relationships. The converbial marker is attached either to the \isi{preterite participle} and the \isi{modal participle} or to the \isi{subjunctive} and the \isi{infinitive} (or follows the respective verb forms). Other ways of obtaining specialized \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses involve the \isi{locative participle} and the noun \tit{zamana} \sqt{time}. Sanzhi possesses the specialized converbs that are given in \refex{ex:Specialized converbs and subordinating enclitics}. There are two enclitics among them (=\textit{qːel(la)} and =\textit{sat}\slash =\textit{satːin}\slash =\textit{satːinna}), which are not only used with verbs in order to form \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses, but also with nominals. Their use with nominals is described in \refsec{sec:Temporal enclitics}. The syntax of \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses is analyzed in \refcpt{cpt:Syntactic properties of adverbial and conditional clauses}.

\subsection{The temporal/causal enclitic \tit{=qːel(la)} \sqt{when, while, because}}
\label{sec:enclitic =qella}

The temporal \tit{=qːel(la)}, which exists in a more commonly used short form and in a less frequently occurring long form, translates as \sqt{when, while, because}. As the other two temporal enclitics it can be hosted by verbs and other parts of speech (\refsec{sec:Temporal enclitics}). When used to form \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses it is added to the \isi{preterite participle} \refex{sssec:The preterite participle} or to the \isi{modal participle} \refex{sssec:The modal participle -an}, and also to forms of the negative \isi{copula} (usually the \isi{participle}, but also other forms) \refex{ex:Well because (they) were not Muslims}. It expresses the temporal simultaneity \refex{ex:‎When they went up there they were praying}, and rarely the temporal anteriority \refex{ex:‎When / after / because at that night} of the situation referred to in the \isi{adverbial clause} with respect to the situation described in the main clause. In many cases, this also implies a causal link between the two events \refex{ex:Well because (they) were not Muslims}.

\end{exe}

When the \isi{enclitic} is hosted by nominals (\isi{nouns}, \is{demonstrative pronoun}demonstrative pronouns, \isi{adjectives}) it also means `when'. Examples are provided in \refsec{sec:Temporal enclitics}.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The temporal marker \tit{-er} \sqt{when, as}}
\label{sec:enclitic =er}

The temporal meaning of simultaneity is also expressed by \tit{-er}, which is, just like \tit{=qːel(la)}, added to the \isi{preterite participle} or to the \isi{modal participle} \xxref{ex:When I moved to Druzhba, I worked in the sovkhoz in Druzhba}{ex:‎As you (masc.) say, they are walking around}. This suffix does not imply any causal relationships. In fact, in some examples there is no relationship whatsoever between the situations expressed in the two clauses \refex{ex:‎As you (masc.) say, they are walking around}. The suffix is only added to verbs, never to nominals or other parts of speech.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:When I moved to Druzhba, I worked in the sovkhoz in Druzhba}
	\gll	Družba-le	ka-jʁ-ib-er,	Družba-le	sowχoz-la	ʡaˁči	b-irq'-ul=de\\

\subsection{The temporal enclitic \tit{=sat}\slash\tit{=satːin}\slash\tit{=satːinna} \sqt{until, before as much\slash long as}}
\label{sec:enclitic =satin}

This \isi{enclitic}, which also belongs to the category of enclitics that can be used with nominals (\refsec{sec:Temporal enclitics}), occurs in three variants of different lengths that can be ordered according to their increasing frequency as  \tit{=satːin} < \tit{=satːinna} < \tit{=sat}. It is a cognate of the spatial/\isi{temporal adverb} \textit{satːi} \sqt{at\slash along the front, as soon as}, which, however, occurs before verbs rather than following them. The adverb can be further decomposed into the postposition \tit{sa} \sqt{in front, ago} and the \isi{adverbializer} \tit{-tːi}, which is part of a few spatial adverbials (\refsec{ssec:SpatialAdverbsDerivedFromPostpositions}).

The \isi{enclitic} follows the \isi{infinitive} and the \isi{subjunctive} and expresses the meaning of temporal posteriority of the situation denoted by the \isi{adverbial clause} with respect to the situation referred to in the main clause, i.e. \sqt{before, until}:

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Until you take your stick out, you have to stand there}
	\gll	u-l	dirxːa	gu-r-b-uqː-ij=sat	k-ercː-an=de	heštːu\\

	\glt	\sqt{Before (the turtle) came back from that place, ...}
\end{exe}

When the \isi{enclitic} is attached to the \isi{modal participle} the meaning is \sqt{as much as, as long as} \refex{ex:‎‎‎The woman was patient as long as she could}. Two more examples are given in \refsec{sec:Temporal enclitics}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎The woman was patient as long as she could}
	\gll	xːunul-li-j	r-irχʷ-an=satːin	jaˁħ	b-irq'-ul=de\\

	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎The woman was \isi{patient} as long as she could.}
\end{exe}

The same meaning is also attested when the \isi{enclitic} follows nominals \refex{ex:‎‎‎Around as much as 700 pictures I made when we went (there) now}, \refex{ex:‎‎‎The ones that I left in passion (i.e. that fell in love with me)}. Finally, the \isi{enclitic} can be attached to \is{demonstrative pronoun}demonstrative pronouns forming manner \is{demonstrative pronoun}demonstrative pronouns that are used in comparison \sqt{like this, like that, such} \refex{ex:‎[‎‎From her small finger he pulled out his parents], so big was his sister}.

\subsection{The temporal adverb/postposition \tit{sar(ka)} \sqt{until, before}}
\label{sec:enclitic =sarka}

The \isi{temporal adverb}/postposition \tit{sar(ka)} \sqt{before, until} (which also has the spatial meaning \sqt{in front}, \refsec{ssec:postposition sa} and \refsec{ssec:SpatialAdverbsDerivedFromPostpositions}) follows the \isi{infinitive} or the \isi{subjunctive}. The resulting meaning is purely one of temporal posteriority, i.e. \sqt{before, until} \refex{ex:‎I was a milkmaid until / before I got married} and occasionally more like an apprehensive \refex{ex:‎‎‎Stand there before / lest / otherwise I hit you with the crook on the head}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎I was a milkmaid until / before I got married}

\subsection{The temporal/causal postposition \tit{(h)itːi} \sqt{after, because}}
\label{sec:temporalcausal postposition hiti}

The postposition/adverb \tit{hitːi} \sqt{after, behind} (see \refsec{ssec:postposition hiti} for the use in postpositional\linebreak phrases) can occur in temporal \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses with the meaning \sqt{when, after}. In the majority of occurrences the postposition is shortened to its \isi{enclitic} variant \tit{=itːi} and directly attached to the \isi{preterite participle} \refex{ex:‎‎‎After we left from there, I did not return.}. However, it is always possible to replace the \isi{enclitic} with the full form \tit{hitːi}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎After we left from there, I did not return.}
	\gll	c'il	helka	ag-ur=itːi	c'il	a-ka-r-ač'-ib=da\\
		then	from.there	go\tsc{.pfv-pret=}after	then	\tsc{neg-down}\tsc{-f-}come\tsc{.pfv-pret=1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎After we left from there, I did not return.}
\end{exe}

Occasionally, the temporal relationship also implies a causal relation between the situation referred to in the \isi{adverbial clause} and the situation expressed in the main clause:

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:After drinking the heart opened}
	\gll	b-erčː-ib=itːi	urk'i	b-at	b-uq-un-ne,	\ldots\\
		\tsc{n-}drink\tsc{.pfv-pret=}after	heart	\tsc{n-}free	\tsc{n-}go\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb}\\
	\glt	\sqt{After drinking the heart opened, (and he molested his wife).}
\end{exe}

Instead of using the bare \isi{preterite participle} it is also possible to suffix another marker \tit{-la} to the \isi{participle}, which is, in turn, followed by the postposition \refex{ex:After the times of the war finished he married her}, \refex{ex:after he started drinking}. The suffix -\textit{la} goes most probably back to the \isi{genitive} case suffix since \tit{hitːi} governs the \isi{genitive}. The suffix -\textit{la} undergoes \isi{assimilation} after the sonorants /n/ and /r/ (> -\textit{na}, -\textit{ra}). It can also be employed on its own without the following postposition \textit{hitːi} (\refsec{sec:temporal marker -la}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:After the times of the war finished he married her}
	\gll	il-tːi	daˁwi	taman	d-iχ-ub-la	hitːi	xadi	ka-r-iž-ib	hel\\
		that-\tsc{pl}	war	end	\tsc{npl-}be\tsc{.pfv-pret-post}	after	married	down\tsc{-f-}sit\tsc{.pfv-pret}	that\\
	\glt	\sqt{After the times of the war finished he married her.}

	\ex	\label{ex:after he started drinking}
	\gll	deč-la	učː-ul	w-aʔ-ač'-ib-la	hitːi, \ldots\\
		drinking\tsc{-gen}	drink\tsc{.m.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{m-}begin-come\tsc{.pfv-pret-post}	after\\
	\glt	\sqt{after he started drinking, \ldots}
\end{exe}

In elicitation it is possible to place the postposition \textit{hitːi} after the \isi{modal participle} -\textit{an} to which again \tit{-la} (in its assimilated allomorphic form \tit{-na}) can be suffixed \refex{ex:‎‎‎If / because she comes, I will not go there.}. In this construction, however, the meaning diverges and instead of the sequential meaning we get a causal\slash \isi{conditional} meaning. Now the clause containing the postposition expresses a condition or cause for the situation that the main clause denotes.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎If / because she comes, I will not go there.}
	\gll	it	sa-r-irʁ-an-na	hitːi	du	itːu	a-ax-an=da\\
		that	\tsc{hither-f-}come\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp-post}	after	\tsc{1sg}	there	\tsc{neg-}go\tsc{.m-ptcp=1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎If\slash because she comes, I will not go there.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:Why should I go to Makhachkala, if / since I can will see the concert in Druzhba?}
	\gll	cellij	du	Maˁħaˁčqːala-le	w-ax-an=da=ja,	dam		Družba-le-b		kancert	či-b-ig-an=itːi?\\

	\glt	\sqt{Why should I go to Makhachkala, if\slash since I can will see the concert in Druzhba?} (E)
\end{exe}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The temporal marker \tit{-la} \sqt{since, after}}
\label{sec:temporal marker -la}

This marker is suffixed to the \isi{preterite participle}. As mentioned in \refsec{sec:temporalcausal postposition hiti}, it goes back to the \isi{genitive} and the construction most probably arose as a simplified variant of the use of the same marker followed by the postposition \tit{hitːi}. The meaning of both constructions is very similar expressing temporal posteriortity of the situation that the \isi{adverbial clause} refers to with respect to a second situation that is normally expressed by the main clause. However, the \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses that contain only \tit{-la} without a following postposition mean \sqt{since then, ever since, from then on, after that}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎In Sanzhi there was no (such plant), now there is, since we moved here}
	\gll	Sanži-b	b-akːʷ-i,	hana	ca-b	il	nušːa	ka-d-eʁ-ib-la\\
		Sanzhi\tsc{-n}	\tsc{n-cop.neg-hab.pst}	now	\tsc{cop-n}	that	\tsc{1pl}	\tsc{down-1/2pl-}go\tsc{.pfv-pret-post}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎In Sanzhi there was no (such plant), now there is, since we moved here.}
\end{exe}

The postposition can always be added and this results in a slight change of the meaning. In \refex{ex:Since the trial, after the trial was made, he is already sitting in prison} the speaker uses first the construction with \tit{-la} and then the construction containing the encliticized postposition, but lacking \tit{-la}. Both clauses have similar, but not completely identical, semantics. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Since the trial, after the trial was made, he is already sitting in prison}
	\gll	hej	sud	b-arq'-ib-la,	sud	b-arq'-ib=itːi,	hej	ka-jž-ib	ca-w	uže	tusnaq-le	hež\\
		this	trial	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.pfv-pret-post}	trial	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.pfv-pret=}after	this	\tsc{down}-remain\tsc{.m.pfv-pret}	\tsc{cop-m}	already	prison\tsc{-loc}	this\\
	\glt	\sqt{Since the trial, after the trial was made, he is already sitting in prison.}
\end{exe}

To sum up, in certain contexts the three options (only \tit{-la}, only \tit{=itːi}, or \tit{-la} + \textit{hitːi}) have very similar or even identical meaning (\sqt{after, when}). In other contexts when \tit{-la} is used alone it means rather \sqt{since}.

\subsection{The periphrastic adverbial construction with \tit{b-el-le} \sqt{while, as long as, as soon as, until, when}}
\label{sec:periphrastic adverbial construction belle}

The defective verb \tit{b-el} \sqt{remain, stay} when inflected as \isi{perfective converb} heads periphrastic \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses. The same type of \isi{periphrastic verb form} is attested in independent clauses (\refsec{sec:Verb forms with b-el remain, stay}), but the use in dependent clauses is far more common. The verb can occur together with a lexical verb that bears either the imperfective or the \isi{perfective converb} suffix. It does not assign case to any arguments and therefore shows the same \isi{gender}/\isi{number} agreement as the lexical verbs \refex{ex:‎While until / as long as he is not drinking, everything is good for them}. However, it can also be used in the invariant form \tit{b-el-le} \refex{ex:When / as soon as he went out from there, he mounted the horse} in which \isi{gender} agreement is lost in favor of the petrified prefix \tit{n-} (neuter singular).

When \tit{b-el} co-occurs with a lexical verb inflected for the \isi{imperfective converb} the meaning of the \isi{adverbial clause} is \sqt{while, until, as long as} \refex{ex:‎While until / as long as he is not drinking, everything is good for them}. In combination with the past perfect in the main clause the \isi{adverbial clause} refers to a situation that obtained at a reference point in the past (= the situation expressed in the main clause) and continued to a later point in time at which the other situation had finished \refex{ex:‎‎‎The poor man took the stone}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎While until / as long as he is not drinking, everything is good for them}
	\gll	a-w-čː-ul	w-el-le	[\ldots]	li<d>il	iš-tː-a-la	ʡaˁħ-le	ca-d\\

	\glt	\sqt{‎While until\slash as long as he is not drinking, everything is good for them.}

	\glt	\sqt{While\slash as long as he was looking at its beauty, all animals had already left.}
\end{exe}

If the lexical verb appears in the form of the \isi{perfective converb}, the \isi{adverbial clause} expresses immediate anteriority that can be translated with \sqt{as soon as, immediately when}. It refers to the point in time when an event is completed or was completed or to the moment when a state obtains or obtained rather than to an enduring situation. The relevant state or event immediately precedes the situation denoted by the main clause.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:When / as soon as the master saw the stone, he trembled (started to tremble)}

\subsection{The concessive enclitic \tit{=xːar(e)} \sqt{although, even if}}
\label{sec:concessive enclitic =xar}

The \isi{concessive} \isi{enclitic} \tit{=xːar(e)} is attached to the \isi{preterite participle} \refex{ex:Knowledgeable, he was educated even if he did not study}, \refex{ex:Although she eats, she does not get fat}, to the \isi{modal participle} \refex{ex:‎Although I want, I cannot}, \refex{ex:‎T‎hough they give here (stuff) for debts, there they do not give him (food) for debts}, or to the participial form of the negated \isi{copula}, and expresses concession \sqt{even if, although, though, even though}. In the main clause following a \isi{concessive} clause optionally the \isi{particle} \textit{ja} can occur \refex{ex:Although she eats, she does not get fat}, which is probably a cognate of the disjunctive \isi{particle} \textit{ja}.\largerpage[2]

\begin{exe}

	\glt	\sqt{‎‎Though here they give (food) for debts, there they do not give him (food) for debts.}
\end{exe}

Note that the last example in \refex{ex:‎T‎hough they give here (stuff) for debts, there they do not give him (food) for debts} is an independent clause with the \isi{modal participle} -\textit{an} suffixed to the verbal head of the main clause. Because of the use of the \isi{modal participle} the sentence has a habitual meaning without any specific temporal reference. If the suffix \tit{-ne} were added, we would obtain future tense (\refsec{ssec:Future analytic}) with a modal meaning and temporal reference to future events.

Frequently \isi{concessive} clauses are \isi{copula} constructions without a \isi{copula} item (`although X is Y'), in which case the temporal reference of the \isi{concessive} clause depends on the main clause. For instance, in \refex{ex:‎‎I argued, I quarreled with them, though I was guilty (myself).} the main clause refers to the past and therefore the \isi{concessive} clause also refers to a past event even though it does not contain any morpheme expressing temporal reference (i.e. no preterite or \isi{modal participle}). The host of the \isi{enclitic} in such \isi{concessive} phrases is the \isi{copula} predicate, which can for instance be an adjective \refex{ex:‎‎I argued, I quarreled with them, though I was guilty (myself).}, and adverbial, \refex{ex:‎‎Even though the heart is sorrowful (lit. `narrowly'), I sing my song loudly.}, or a noun \refex{ex:‎‎‎Every fourth or fifth night there was a circle (of people) in my mother's house though it was a small house}. 

\begin{exe}

\end{exe}

There is another way of formulating \isi{concessive} clauses in Sanzhi, namely the use of \isi{conditional} forms to which the \isi{additive} is encliticized (\refsec{sec:concessiveconditionals}).

\subsection{Constructions with \tit{zamana} \sqt{time}}\label{sec:constructions with zamana}
\largerpage

The noun \tit{zamana} \sqt{time}, ultimately an Arabic loan word, is used in temporal \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses that are \is{relative clause}relative clauses from a syntactic point of view (\refcpt{cpt:Relative clauses}). The noun \tit{zamana} is the head, and the \isi{relative clause} contains a verb in the form of the modal or the \isi{preterite participle}. Clauses with the \isi{modal participle} refer to events that were ongoing during a reference point in time or a reference period, which is expressed in the main clause (\sqt{while, when}) \refex{ex:‎While he came from Icari, he went with a torch at night home from work}, \refex{ex:‎‎‎When he was attentively listening he heard the sound of frogs}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎While he came from Icari, he went with a torch at night home from work}
	\gll	Uc'ari-r	haˁ-q'-aˁn	zamana,	lampučka	ca-w=ra	dučːi	ha-aš-i=q'al	qili	ʡaˁči-le-r\\

	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎When he was attentively listening he heard the sound of frogs.}
\end{exe}

Clauses with the \isi{preterite participle} have a comparable meaning of simultaneity:

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎While he presented the condolences (lit. kept his hands in front), Zhapar's wife entered}
	\gll	nuˁq-be	sa-ka-d-uc-ib		zamana,	žaˁpar-ra	xːunul	qili-rka	tːura	sa-r-uq-un	ca-r\\

	\glt	\sqt{‎While I got up, my eyes remained on the porridge.}
\end{exe}

The \tit{zamana}-construction can be combined with the \isi{particle} \tit{bah} \sqt{immediately when} that occurs in the initial position of the \isi{relative clause} \refex{ex:‎When this tree already felt down, the dogs were coming}. The precise origin of \tit{bah} needs further investigation, but we might suggest that it is related to the superlative \isi{particle} \tit{bah} \sqt{most} and to the adverbs \tit{bahsala, bahsar} \sqt{first}, which can be decomposed into \tit{bah-} and a following postposition. The \isi{particle} can also co-occur with the \isi{enclitic} \tit{=qːel(la)}.

\begin{exe}

\subsection{Minor ways of forming adverbial clauses}
\label{sec:minor ways of forming adverbial clauses}

The \isi{locative participle} and the \isi{masdar} can occur in \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses expressing causes when they take the \isi{dative} suffix \refex{ex:ecause Maja was sleeping I (masc.) could not come.}, \refex{ex:This is for you, because you helped me out of the pit}, because the expression of causes is one of the functions of the \isi{dative} (\refsec{sssec:Dative}):

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:ecause Maja was sleeping I (masc.) could not come.}
	\gll	[Maˁʡaˁ	ka-r-ils-na-lli-j]	du	uq'-ij	a-jχ-ub=da\\
		Maja	\tsc{down-f-}sleep\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp.loc-obl-dat}	\tsc{1sg}	go\tsc{.m-inf}	\tsc{neg-}be.able\tsc{.m.pfv-pret=1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎Because Maja was sleeping I (masc.) could not come.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:This is for you, because you helped me out of the pit}
	\gll	hež	at	ca-b,	du	kur-ri-cːe-r	tːura	ha-qː-ni-li-j\\

	\glt	\sqt{This is for you, because you helped me out of the pit.}
\end{exe}

When the postposition \tit{bahanne\slash bahandan} \sqt{because of} (\refsec{ssec:postposition bahanne}) follows the \isi{masdar}, the resulting clause also expresses causation \refex{ex:‎Because they cut it, they died}. By contrast, when it follows the \isi{infinitive} or the \isi{subjunctive} we get purpose clauses \refex{ex:‎in order to shake those, in order to shake the threshing boards}:

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎Because they cut it, they died}
	\gll	ka-b-ičː-ni	bahanne	b-ebč'-ib\\
		\tsc{down-n-}cut.up\tsc{.pfv-msd}	because.of	\tsc{hpl-}die\tsc{.pfv-pret}\\

\section{Conditional and concessive verb forms and clauses}
\label{cpt:conditionalconcessiveclauses}

Conditional and \isi{concessive} clauses are \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses that contain specialized verb forms expressing realis and irrealis \isi{conditional} and \isi{concessive} meaning. All verb forms here are obtained by means of suffixes that are added to a stem augmentation vowel. The vowel is the same that is used for synthetic verb forms (\refcpt{cpt:verbs-indicativesynthetic}) and some non-declarative verb forms (\refcpt{cpt:verbs-nondeclarative}) and not separately glossed in the examples. The suffixes express \isi{conditional} meaning and \isi{person agreement} and bear resemblance to the suffixes of the synthetic tenses. The following forms are treated in this section:

\begin{itemize}
	\item	realis \isi{conditional} (\refsec{sec:realisconditional}) 
	\item	past \isi{conditional} (\refsec{sec:pastconditional})
	\item	imperfective realis \isi{conditional} (\refsec{sec:imperfectiverealisconditional})
	\item	imperfective past \isi{conditional} (\refsec{sec:imperfectivepastconditional})
	\item	periphrastic \is{conditional clause}conditional clauses (\refsec{sec:periphrasticconditionalclauses})
	\item	\isi{concessive} conditionals (\refsec{sec:concessiveconditionals})
\end{itemize}

All \isi{conditional} forms head dependent clauses, thus they are normally followed by a main clause. The \isi{conditional} suffixes alone suffice to convey \isi{conditional} meaning, but optionally the \isi{conjunction} \textit{raχle} `if' can co-occur in \is{conditional clause}conditional clauses \refex{ex:If (he) caught him, he must stand there}. However, the use of the subordinating \isi{conjunction} is rare.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:If (he) caught him, he must stand there}
	\gll	raχle	uc-arre	het	k-ercː-an	ca-w	heštːu\\
		if	catch\tsc{.m.pfv-cond.3}	that	\tsc{down}-stand\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp}	\tsc{cop-m}	here\\
	\glt	\sqt{If (he) caught him, he must stand there.}
\end{exe}

\subsection{Realis conditional}
\label{sec:realisconditional}

The realis \isi{conditional} is formed from perfective verb stems (for those verbs that occur in pairs of imperfective and perfective stems). To the verbal stem the stem augments (vowels \tit{-u} or \tit{-i}) are added, followed by the \isi{conditional} suffixes (\reftab{tab:realisconditional}). In the second person singular, there are two variants possible, \tit{-tːe} and \tit{-tːel}, but the first is clearly preferred. In the third person, there is again largely lexically determined allomorphy between the suffixes \tit{-an} and \tit{-ar}. The latter suffix has a longer variant \tit{-arre}, but the shorter variant is more common. In negative realis \is{conditional clause}conditional clauses the verb bears the negative prefix \tit{a-} \refex{ex:‎‎‎If you (= masc.) do not calm down, I make you calm, he says}.

\begin{table}

The function of the \isi{conditional} is the expression of real non-past conditions: 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎The bride who just married}
	\gll	``hana	ka-r-iž-ib	c'ikuri-li,''	∅-ik'-ul	ca-w,	``misa či-b-ikː-arre	urχːab	kʷir	ka-b-irg-an-ne''\\

	\glt	\sqt{``‎The bride who just married,'' says one, ``if she kisses the mill it will stop.''}

	\ex	\label{ex:If I do not read (my song), I burst inside.}
	\gll	a-b-elč'-ille,	w-ark	∅-utː-ud\\
		\tsc{neg-n-}read\tsc{.pfv-cond.1}	\tsc{m-}inside	\tsc{m-}burst\tsc{.ipfv-1.prs}\\
	\glt	\sqt{If I do not read (my song), I (masc.) burst inside.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎If you (= masc.) do not calm down, I make you calm, he says}
	\gll	``a-w-g-utːe,	u	parʁat	∅-irq'-an=de,''	∅-ik'-ul	ca-w	ik'\\

	\glt	\sqt{``‎‎‎If you (= masc.) do not calm down, I make you calm,'' he says.}
\end{exe}

It also occurs in utterances in which the \isi{conditional} is not a condition for the apodosis because there is no \isi{conditional} connection between the two clauses. This includes the common idiomatic expression \sqt{to be honest} (lit. \sqt{if I tell correctly}) \refex{ex:I, to be honest, remained for three years.}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎There is much there (i.e. the graveyard is large), if you go there}
	\gll	celi d-aqil	k'e-d,	či-d-uˁq'-uˁtːal\\

	\glt	\sqt{‎‎There is much there (i.e. the graveyard is large), if you go there.}

	\ex	\label{ex:I, to be honest, remained for three years.}
	\gll	du,	b-arx-le	b-urs-ille	ʡaˁbal	dus	kelg-un=da\\

	\glt	\sqt{I, to be honest, remained for three years.}
\end{exe}

As with the two indicative \is{analytic verb form}analytic verb forms, the \isi{habitual present} and the \isi{habitual past}, in \is{conditional clause}conditional clauses \isi{ergative} alignment is, in addition to the \isi{dative} construction, possible with some \is{affective verb}affective verbs. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Past conditional}
\label{sec:pastconditional}

The past \isi{conditional} bears strong formal resemblances to the realis \isi{conditional} and the second person is almost identical for both \isi{conditional} forms (\reftab{tab:pastconditional}). Before the \isi{conditional} past suffixes the stem augment vowels occur that are the same as for the realis \isi{conditional} and for a \isi{number} of other verb forms such as the \isi{subjunctive}. In the third person, the first part of the two allomorphic suffixes \tit{-ar-del} and \tit{-an-del} is identical with the suffixes used in the realis \isi{conditional} (\reftab{tab:realisconditional}). The second part probably originates from the past \isi{enclitic} \tit{=de}. Negation is marked with the prefix \tit{a-}. Only perfective verb stems can function as the basis for the past \isi{conditional}.

\begin{table}
	\caption{The past conditional}
	\label{tab:pastconditional}
	\small
	\begin{tabularx}{0.40\textwidth}[]{%
		>{\centering\arraybackslash}p{10pt}

			3	&	\multicolumn{2}{c}{\tit{-ar-del\slash -an-del}}\\
		\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The semantic range of the past \isi{conditional} comprises the expression of realis conditions that were obtained in the past.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:If we were too late}
	\gll	raχle	q'an	d-iχ-utːel, \ldots\\
		if	late	\tsc{1/2pl-}be\tsc{.pfv-cond.1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{If we were too late, \ldots}

	\ex	\label{ex:If you hold the tail (of the fish) and lift it up and shake it}
	\gll	č'imi	b-uc-ib-le,	aq	b-arq'-ib-le,	hak'	ka-b-arq'-itːel,	dig-be	k-arž-i	skelet	kalž-i\\

	\glt	\sqt{If you held the tail (of the fish) and lifted it up and shook it, the meat fell down and the skeleton remained.}

	\ex	\label{ex:When/if graves fell down, (grandfather) put them up again}
	\gll	χːuˁrbe	ka-d-ik-ardel, 	χːuˁrbe	ʡaˁħ	d-irq'-ul=de\\
		graves	\tsc{down-npl-}occur\tsc{.pfv-cond.pst} graves	good	\tsc{1/2.pl-}do\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=pst}\\
	\glt	\sqt{When/if graves fell down, (grandfather) put them up again.} (lit. made them good)
\end{exe}

Furthermore, it conveys irrealis \isi{conditional} meanings, i.e. conditions with low probability and \isi{counterfactual} conditions \refex{ex:‎if he would have said it with his own mouth}, and those sentences can lack the apodosis \refex{ex:‎‎‎If they would go! They bore (me)}, \refex{ex:if (you) would eat bread made of rye, it is the best thing for you}. The apodosis of past \is{conditional clause}conditional clauses often contains a verb marked for future in the past (\refsec{ssec:Future in the past}) or \isi{habitual past} (\refsec{sec:vis-habitualpast}) \refex{ex:If you hold the tail (of the fish) and lift it up and shake it}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎if he would have said it with his own mouth}

\subsection{Imperfective realis conditional}
\label{sec:imperfectiverealisconditional}

The imperfective realis \isi{conditional} is formed from imperfective verb stems (for those verbs that occur in pairs of imperfective and perfective stems) by means of the suffix \tit{-aχː}, followed by the vowel \tit{-a} that functions as a stem augment without expressing transitivity, and finally by (almost) the same person suffixes that are used for the realis \isi{conditional} (\refsec{sec:realisconditional}).  As with all \isi{conditional} forms treated in this Section, \isi{negation} is marked by means of \tit{a-} \refex{ex:If I cannot educate (up bring) her (myself), she said, then the life is of no need for me.}. Some \is{affective verb}affective verbs can occur in the \isi{dative} \isi{experiencer} construction and in the \isi{ergative} construction when inflected for the imperfective realis \isi{conditional}.

The imperfective realis \isi{conditional} is basically the imperfective counterpart of the realis \isi{conditional}. According to Sanzhi speakers, it covers the same meanings, with the only difference being the aspectual value that the stem carries. Thus, we have realis \isi{conditional} semantics with present and future time reference \refex{ex:If I cannot educate (up bring) her (myself), she said, then the life is of no need for me.}, \refex{ex:‎‎‎If she is not able to carry those (sacks), of what use is she for me?} and occassionally in utterance in which no genuine \isi{conditional} semantics is expressed \refex{ex:After having pulled (him) out, if they look, there is not head}. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:If I cannot educate (up bring) her (myself), she said, then the life is of no need for me.}
	\gll	``hej	ha-r-iq'-ij	a-r-irχʷ-aχː-alle,''	r-ik'ʷ-ar,	``dam	ʡuˁmru	ħaˁžat-le=kːu''\\

	\glt	\sqt{``If I cannot educate (i.e. bring up) her (myself),'' she said, ``then life is of no need for me.''}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎If she is not able to carry those (sacks), of what use is she for me?}
	\gll	hel-tːi	ha-qː-ij	a-r-irχʷ-aχː-an		il	ce	r-irq'-an=e	dam?\\

	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎If she is not able to carry those (sacks), of what use is she for me?} (i.e. a wife that is unable to carry the sacks of flour is useless)

	\ex	\label{ex:After having pulled (him) out, if they look, there is not head}
	\gll	qus	tːura-k-aˁq-ib-le,	er	∅-ik'ʷ-aχː-an,	il	bek'	b-akːu	\\

	\glt	\sqt{After having pulled (him) out, if they look, there is no head.}
\end{exe}

The verbs that do not have an aspectual distinction can form the realis \isi{conditional} as well as the imperfective realis \isi{conditional} without any noticeable semantic difference between the two forms \refex{ex:‎‎‎if we go (E)}. For verbs with two aspectual stems the semantic difference is restricted to the aspectual difference between imperfective and \isi{perfective aspect}; the \isi{conditional} meaning is identical for both forms \refex{ex:‎ if I see the horse (regularly / once) (E)}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎if we go (E)}
	\gll	nušːa	d-ax-ulle /		d-ax-aχː-alle\\
		\tsc{1pl}	\tsc{npl-}go\tsc{-cond.1}	/ \tsc{npl-}go\tsc{-cond-cond.1}\\

\subsection{Imperfective past conditional}
\label{sec:imperfectivepastconditional}

There is also a past version of the imperfective \isi{conditional} formed only from imperfective verbs. The precise formal make-up is still to be clarified since the form is only very rarely used. There are no corpus examples and elicitation is hard due to the insecurity of the speakers. It seems that the suffix \tit{-aχː-an-del} can be used with all persons. It expresses irrealis \isi{conditional} \refex{ex:‎‎‎If a car would go to the sea, we would go.}, \refex{ex:If I would see a nice car, I would want it.} and past \isi{conditional} meaning \refex{ex:At that time when I saw a nice car in the city, I wanted it.}, depending on the sentence and the further context.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎If a car would go to the sea, we would go.}
	\gll	mašin	b-ax-aχː-andel	urx-n-a-cːe	nušːa	d-ax-adi\\

\subsection{Periphrastic conditional clauses}
\label{sec:periphrasticconditionalclauses}

As shown in \xxref{ex:‎If I do not tell it correctly, correct me!}{ex:If the woman had stolen, they would/should have imprisoned her}, \is{conditional clause}conditional clauses can be periphrastic, i.e., make use of the additional auxiliary \tit{b-iχʷ-} \tsc{(pfv)} \sqt{be, become, can}. In such clauses, the lexical verb bears a converb or occasionally a participial suffix and the auxiliary \tit{b-iχʷ-} takes one of the \isi{conditional} forms, e.g. realis \isi{conditional} \refex{ex:‎If I do not tell it correctly, correct me!} or past \isi{conditional}\slash irrealis \isi{conditional} \xxref{ex:There must have been people there}{ex:If the woman had stolen, they would/should have imprisoned her}. More examples can be found in \refsec{ssec:Periphrastic conditionals}, which describes all uses of \tit{b-iχʷ-} as auxiliary.

\subsection{Concessive conditionals}
\label{sec:concessiveconditionals}

The \isi{conditional} forms presented in the preceding sections can acquire a \isi{concessive} \isi{conditional} meaning (\sqt{even if}) when the \isi{additive} is encliticized to the \isi{conditional} suffixes. For instance, the realis \isi{conditional} \refex{ex:‎‎‎Even if I die today, I am not worried, she said} or the past \isi{conditional} \refex{ex:‎‎Even if I had money, I would not buy a car} can serve as the base for concessives.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎Even if I die today, I am not worried, she said}
	\gll	``ižal	r-ebk'-ulle=ra	awara	b-akːu,''	r-ik'ʷ-ar\\
		today	\tsc{f-}die\tsc{.pfv-cond.1=add}	worries	\tsc{n-}\tsc{cop.neg}	\tsc{f-}say\tsc{.ipfv-prs.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{``‎‎‎Even if I die today, I am not worried,'' she said.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎Even if I had money, I would not buy a car}
	\gll	di-la	arc	d-iχʷ-ardel=ra		du-l	mašin	a-jsː-adi\\
		\tsc{1sg-gen}	money	\tsc{npl-}be\tsc{.pfv-cond.pst=add}	\tsc{1sg-erg}	car	\tsc{neg-}buy\tsc{.pfv-hab.pst.1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎Even if I had money, I would not buy a car.} (E)
\end{exe}

The third person \isi{concessive} \isi{conditional} form of the auxiliary \tit{b-iχʷ-} (\tsc{n-}be\tsc{.pfv}) used in combination with interrogative pronouns lexicalized into a universal indefinite free choice pronoun similar to the English \tit{-ever} series \refex{ex:Are you able to do whatever? he says} (\refsec{ssec:Free-choice indefinite pronouns}). Similarly, the verb \tit{b-ikː-} \sqt{like, want, love} can function as universal indefinite free choice when it takes a \isi{concessive} \isi{conditional} form and co-occurs with an interrogative pronoun \refex{ex:How often whoever you love, I am your compass}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Are you able to do whatever? he says}
	\gll	``u-l	b-arq'-ij	w-irχ-utːe=w''	w-ik'-ul	ca-w	``ce-k'a	b-iχʷ-ar=ra?''\\
		\tsc{2sg-erg}	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.pfv-inf}	\tsc{m-}be.able\tsc{.ipfv-prs.2sg=q}	\tsc{m-}say\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{cop-m}	what\tsc{-indef}		\tsc{n-}be\tsc{.pfv-cond.3=add}\\
	\glt	\sqt{``Are you able to do whatever?'' he says.}

	\ex	\label{ex:How often whoever you love, I am your compass}
	\gll	čujna	ča	w-ikː-aχː-at=ra		du=da	ala	q'iblama\\
		how.often	who	\tsc{m-}want\tsc{.ipfv-cond-cond.2=add}	\tsc{1sg=1}	\tsc{2sg.gen}	compass\\
	\glt	\sqt{No matter how often or who you love, I am your compass.}
\end{exe}

However, \isi{conditional} forms with an additional \isi{additive enclitic} do not always express \isi{conditional} \isi{concessive} meaning. For present \isi{conditional} forms the \isi{concessive} semantics can be very weak \refex{ex:If you let the ashes of your cigarette fall down} or even absent, in which case only the \isi{conditional} meaning is conveyed. For past conditionals the meaning is irrealis \isi{conditional} instead of \isi{concessive} \refex{ex:if (you) would eat bread made of rye, it is the best thing for you}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:If you let the ashes of your cigarette fall down}
	\gll	hel=de		hel	pepel	p'aq'	ka-b-arq'-itːe=ra,	``uberi!''	b-ik'-ul=de	``hetːi''\\
		that\tsc{=pst}	that	ashes	shake.off	\tsc{down-n}-do.\tsc{pfv-cond.2sg=add}	take.away	\tsc{hpl-}say\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=pst}	those\\
	\glt	\sqt{(Even) if you let the ashes of your cigarette fall down, they said, ``Put it away!''} (i.e. make it clean)
\end{exe}

There is another way of forming \isi{concessive} clauses by means of the \isi{enclitic} \tit{=xːar} (\refsec{sec:concessive enclitic =xar}).
