\label{sec:Verb valency classes}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:valencyclassesintro}

Valency classes cross-cut the morphological classes of verbs. This means that the morphological classes (underived verb stems with or without \is{preverb}preverbs, derived verbs, \is{compound verb}compound verbs, see  \refsec{sec:Overview about the general morphological structure of verbs} and \refcpt{cpt:verbformation}) distribute over the \is{valency class}valency classes with probably a preference for the simple underived verbs to occur in the intransitive, the transitive and to a somewhat lesser extent the affective \isi{valency class}.

I will categorize verbs into \is{valency class}valency classes according to two main criteria: (i) the \isi{number} of arguments and (ii) the case marking of the subject-like argument. By `subject-like argument' I refer to the argument of the \isi{simple clause} that has the most subject properties as opposed to all other arguments (see \refsec{sec:Grammatical relations} for more details). Subject-like arguments are marked with one of the three cases \isi{absolutive}, \isi{ergative} or \isi{dative}. I use the terms ``one-place'' or ``monovalent'', ``two-place'' or ``bivalent'', and ``three-place'' or ``trivalent'' for referring to the \isi{number} of semantic arguments required by the verbs. The basic \is{valency class}valency classes and the case marking of the subject-like argument are summarized in \reftab{tab:Valency classes}.\largerpage



\begin{table}
	\caption{Valency classes and case marking of subject-like arguments}
	\label{tab:Valency classes}
	\small
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{lQQQ}		
		\lsptoprule
		{} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{subject-like argument}\\\cmidrule(lr){2-4}
			\# valency		&	\isit{absolutive}				&	\isit{dative}			&	\isit{ergative}\\
		\midrule
			monovalent	&	intransitive (\refsec{sec:Intransitive verbs})		&	monovalent affective (\refsec{sec:Monovalent affective verbs and exceptional monovalent constructions})	&	one verb \refex{ex:precipitation}\\	   
			bivalent		&	extended intransitive (\refsec{sec:Extended intransitive verbs})		&	bivalent affective (\refsec{sec:Bivalent affective verbs})		&	transitive (\refsec{sec:Transitive verbs})\\
			trivalent	&	\#	&		\#		&	ditransitive (\refsec{sec:Extended transitive verbs and ditransitive verbs})\\ 
		\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

The term ``extended intransitive'' refers to two-place predicates that, in addition to an argument in the \isi{absolutive}, have a further argument in the \isi{dative} or another case; ``extended transitive'' verbs are \isi{three-place verbs} that besides having two arguments bearing the cases that are also used for \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs, have an additional argument marked with the \isi{dative} or in some other way \citet[122\tnd123]{Dixon1994}. Thus, extended \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs are ditransitive verbs. Furthermore, I use the term ``affective predicates'' for a clear-cut class of mostly \isi{experiential} predicates that express the \isi{experiencer} argument in the \isi{dative} and the \isi{stimulus} argument, if there is one, in the \isi{absolutive}. Affective verbs typically form their own \isi{valency class} in East Caucasian (see, e.g. \citealp{Comrie.vandenBerg2006}; \citealp{Ganenkov2006}; \citealp{Comrie.Forker.KhalilovaInPressb}). One might hypothesize that they belong to the class of extended \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs. However, if one applies the commonly used test for subjecthood to the extended \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs and the \is{affective verb}affective verbs it immediately becomes clear that with the former class it is the \isi{absolutive} argument that exhibits most subject properties whereas with the latter class it is the \isi{dative} argument. For more information on grammatical relations in Sanzhi see \refsec{sec:Grammatical relations} and \citealp{Forker2019}.

\reftab{tab:Major valency classes} provides an overview of the major \is{valency class}valency classes discussed in this chapter; some minor classes are not listed, but discussed below. All verbs in the table and in the following subsections are presented in the order imperfective\slash perfective if they have two stems. Otherwise the single stem that is unspecified for aspect is given. In the table and in this chapter as well as elsewhere in the grammar I will use the following letters as mnemonics for macro roles (see \citealt{Bickel2011} and \citealt{Bickel.etal2015}): 

\begin{itemize}
	\item[S =] single argument of an intransitive predicate or \isi{absolutive} argument of an extended intransitive predicate
	\item[A =] the argument with the most agentive properties of a bivalent or trivalent predicate (except for extended intransitive predicates, for which S is used)
	\item[P =] the argument with the least agentive or most patientive properties of a bivalent predicate
	\item[G =] goal-like argument of a trivalent predicate (e.g. \isi{recipient})
	\item[T =] more stationary theme-like argument of a trivalent predicate 
	\end{itemize}
	%
Subject-like arguments are of the type S or A. Note that S occurs with monovalent and \isi{bivalent verbs}, which might seem slightly unusual. My reason for using the label S in this way is case marking, because all arguments falling under this label are marked by the \isi{absolutive} case, which leads to a range of common morphosyntactic properties. For more details on grammatical relations see \refsec{sec:Grammatical relations}.

As \reftab{tab:Valency classes} shows, \is{monovalent verb}monovalent verbs have three possibilities for marking their single argument. The majority of the \is{monovalent verb}monovalent verbs assign the \isi{absolutive} case to the single argument (\refsec{sec:Intransitive verbs}), though \isi{dative} or, in case of one verb, \isi{ergative} are also possible (\refsec{sec:Monovalent affective verbs and exceptional monovalent constructions}).\largerpage


\reftab{tab:Case-marking of arguments of bivalent predicates} summarizes the case-marking patterns available in constructions with bivalent predicates, because they are the largest and most heterogeneous group. The columns represent the possible cases for subject-like arguments, which can be \isi{absolutive} (S) or \isi{ergative} (A), or \isi{dative} (A). The rows display the possible cases for P arguments (\isi{absolutive}, \isi{dative}, \isi{genitive}, \is{spatial case}spatial cases, \isi{ergative}). As the table shows, the \isi{absolutive} case is the most versatile case that can be combined with all other cases and encodes S, A or P, but the \isi{ergative} is also quite flexible. 

\begin{table}
	\caption{Case-marking of arguments in constructions with bivalent predicates}
	\label{tab:Case-marking of arguments of bivalent predicates}
	\small
	\begin{tabular}{llll}

		\midrule
			\isit{absolutive} P	&	y  \refex{ex:The people turned into stones}, \refex{ex:I will be 75 years old}		&	\mbox{y (transitive)}	&	y (affective)\\

			\isit{ergative} P	&	y (\isit{antipassive})	&	\#						&	\#\\	 
		\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note that \reftab{tab:Case-marking of arguments of bivalent predicates} conflates basic \is{valency class}valency classes for bivalent predicates (i.e. extended intransitive, transitive, affective) with a \isi{number} of other special constructions, which are available for some predicates of the basic \is{valency class}valency classes (\isi{antipassive}, constructions with \isi{absolutive}, \isi{dative} or \isi{genitive} Ps).  

The first row in \reftab{tab:Case-marking of arguments of bivalent predicates} lists all constructions that consist of an S argument in the \isi{absolutive} and a further P argument. These clauses with extended intransitive predicates, but also antipassives (\refsec{sec:Antipassive}), and two minor constructions with \isi{absolutive} and \isi{genitive} P arguments are described in \refsec{sec:Extended intransitive verbs}. In all clauses with \isi{bivalent verbs} and \isi{absolutive} S arguments it is the S that controls \isi{gender} agreement. Gender agreement with any other arguments is ungrammatical.

The second row in \reftab{tab:Case-marking of arguments of bivalent predicates} contains all constructions with \isi{ergative} A arguments and P arguments with various cases. First of all, the P argument can have the \isi{absolutive} case (standard \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs including causativized \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs, and, in certain TAM forms, \is{affective verb}affective verbs, \refsec{sec:Transitive verbs}, \refsec{sec:Bivalent affective verbs}, \refsec{sec:Causativization}). A few \isi{bivalent verbs} with an \isi{ergative} \isi{agent} (A) require a \isi{goal} or beneficiary argument marked with the \isi{dative} or \tsc{in}-lative, or even an \isi{experiencer} in the \isi{genitive} \refex{ex:I am hugging you}, which represents the P argument. These verbs commonly have lexicalized direct objects in the \isi{absolutive} case that are invariable parts of the \isi{compound verb} and therefore do not count as arguments (\refsec{sec:Bivalent verbs with frozen objects}).

Third, \isi{bivalent verbs} with A arguments taking the \isi{dative} are, as mentioned above, mostly \is{affective verb}affective verbs that have a P (\isi{stimulus}) in the \isi{absolutive}.

\subsection{Intransitive verbs}\label{sec:Intransitive verbs}
\largerpage

In\is{transitive verb}transitive verbs are one-place verbs. The single argument occurs in the \isi{absolutive} and controls the \isi{gender}/\isi{number} agreement and the \isi{person agreement} on the verb. Example verbs are given in \refex{ex:intransitiveverbs} and examples sentences in \xxref{ex:My arms got tiredValency}{ex:Our (people) were fasting like nowadays1}.

There are a variety of \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs that are compounds and contain a nominal part (\refsec{ssec:compoundswithnouns}). The nominal part, however, does not function as argument of the verb. It most frequently appears in the \isi{absolutive} case \refex{ex:Our (people) were fasting like nowadays1}, but the \isi{genitive} case is also possible \refex{ex:He built a house and married.}, or the \tsc{loc}-lative or \is{spatial postposition}spatial postpositions/adverbials. Note that in \refex{ex:Our (people) were fasting like nowadays1} the \isi{absolutive} argument that controls the agreement has been omitted and only its \isi{genitive} modifier appears in the clause.

\subsection{Monovalent affective verbs and exceptional monovalent constructions}\label{sec:Monovalent affective verbs and exceptional monovalent constructions}
\largerpage

Sanzhi Dargwa has a few constructions with monovalent predicates and a single argument fulfilling the role of a dative-marked \isi{experiencer} \refex{ex:affective verbsMonovalent}. Such constructions can be \isi{copula} constructions with adverbs \refex{ex:I feel bad there} or contain \is{compound verb}compound verbs \refex{ex:At night I had no sleep}. Gender/\isi{number} agreement is frozen (prefixes \tit{b-} or occasionally \tit{d-}) and the \isi{person agreement} is invariably third person.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:affective verbsMonovalent}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{b-uχːar-(le) ca-b} \sqt{be cold}
		\ex	\tit{wahi-l ca-b} \sqt{feel bad}
		\ex	\tit{ʡaˁħ-le ca-b} \sqt{feel good, be well}	
		\ex	\tit{buruš hitːi sa-b-irk-\slash buruš hitːi sa-b-ik-} \sqt{sleep, fall asleep}	
		\ex	\tit{beža hitːi d-irk-\slash beža hitːi d-ik-} \sqt{catch a cold}
	\end{xlist}

	\ex	\label{ex:I feel bad there}

	\glt	\sqt{At night I had no sleep.} (E)
\end{exe}

The \is{affective verb}affective verbs \sqt{see} and \sqt{hear} can also be used as \is{monovalent verb}monovalent verbs with the meaning \sqt{be/become visible, show off} and \sqt{be/become audible} (see \refsec{sec:Argument control in complement constructions} for two example sentences and \refsec{sec:Bivalent affective verbs} below for a discussion).

There is a special predicate denoting weather phenomena that has one single argument marked with the \isi{ergative} \refex{ex:precipitation}, \refex{ex:It is raining}. The verb does not have an aspectual distinction and always shows neuter \isi{gender} and third \isi{person agreement}. The same phenomenon is observed in the neighboring Icari Dargwa variety \citep[155]{Sumbatova.Mutalov2003}, but apparently not in Standard Dargwa.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:precipitation}
	\begin{xlist}

\subsection{Extended intransitive verbs and other constructions with bivalent predicates and absolutive S arguments}
\label{sec:Extended intransitive verbs}
The major class of predicates falling into this category are extended \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs. They are bivalent and have one S argument in the \isi{absolutive} and another argument in the \isi{dative} or in a \isi{spatial case}. Gender/\isi{number} as well as \isi{person agreement} on extended \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs is always controlled by the \isi{absolutive} argument.

The largest \isi{number} of extended \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs have a \isi{goal} argument in the \isi{dative} \refex{ex:extended intransitive verbs}. Example sentences are provided in \xxref{ex:The bandits did not touch him}{ex:‎‎‎The people fought us}. For the verb \tit{xadi ag-\slash argʷ-} \sqt{marry} it is always the nominal referring to the woman that occurs in the \isi{absolutive} while the \isi{dative} argument denotes the man \refex{ex:Then did Kursum (fem.) marry Husen (masc.)}. Some of the verbs given in \refex{ex:extended intransitive verbs} can be used as one-place verbs with reciprocal meaning, e.g. \tit{qaˁb lus b-ilk-\slash qaˁb lus b-ik-} \sqt{embrace each other, hug each other}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:extended intransitive verbs}

Verbs of speech and verbs with similar meanings may mark their addressee argument with the \isi{dative} \refex{ex:The boy began to whistle and to cry to the dogs in the village}, but much more common is the use of the \tsc{in}-lative \refex{ex:The grandfather is calling me@27a}, \refex{ex:He was the one who was talking to the doctors}. There is only one extended \isi{intransitive verb} of speech, \tit{b-ik'ʷ-} \sqt{say}, which is, however, also widely used in \is{compound verb}compound verbs \refex{ex:verbs of speech}.\pagebreak

Extended \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs expressing location, position, or movement combine with various \is{spatial case}spatial cases. Which \isi{spatial case} is used depends on the semantics of the spatial reference point (i.e. the ground) and on the type of localization or motion (e.g. in or on a reference point, movement to a \isi{goal} or from a source). The most common spatial series employed in these functions are the \tsc{spr}-series \refex{ex:A horsefly sat down on the forehead of one (man)}, the \tsc{in}-series \refex{ex:(Apparently) they (=the animals) lived in the mountains}, and the \tsc{ad}-series. Many more examples can be found in \refsec{ssec:Functions of semantic cases} on the \is{spatial case}spatial cases.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:A horsefly sat down on the forehead of one (man)}
	\gll	ca-la	antːa-le	či-ka-b-iž-ib	ca-b	zija\\
		one\tsc{-gen}	forehead\tsc{-loc}	\tsc{spr-down}\tsc{-n-}sit\tsc{.pfv-pret}	\tsc{cop-n}	horsefly\\
	\glt	\sqt{A horsefly sat down on the forehead of one (man).}

	\ex	\label{ex:(Apparently) they (=the animals) lived in the mountains}
	\gll	il-tːi	dubur-t-a-cːe-d	er	d-irχ-ul	d-už-ib	ca-d\\

	\glt	\sqt{(Apparently) they (= the animals) lived in the mountains.}
\end{exe}

Other constructions with an \isi{absolutive} S and a bivalent predicate are instantiated by verbs that assign \isi{absolutive} or \isi{genitive} to the P argument, depending on the meaning of the construction. The combination \isi{absolutive} S plus \isi{absolutive} P is rare \refex{ex:The people turned into stones}, \refex{ex:I will be 75 years old}. These clauses syntactically strongly resemble \isi{copula} clauses but make use of verbs that express meanings other than the simple \isi{copula} meaning. The verb agrees in person, \isi{number} and \isi{gender} with the subject-like argument, which can be distinguished from the second argument in the \isi{absolutive} by reference to prominence properties such as animacy and person.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:The people turned into stones}
	\gll	χalq'	qːarq-ne	arž-i\\
		people	stone\tsc{-pl}	go\tsc{.ipfv-hab.pst.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{The people turned into stones.}

	\ex	\label{ex:I will be 75 years old}
	\gll	du	wer-c'anu	xu-ra	dus	r-irχʷ-an=da\\
		\tsc{1sg}	seven-\tsc{ten}	five\tsc{-num} year	\tsc{f-}be\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp=1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{I (fem.) will be 75 years old.}
\end{exe}

Example \refex{ex:The hips will be a strong medicine} illustrates a clause with two arguments that also resembles \isi{copula}\linebreak clauses. The S argument in the \isi{absolutive} case functions as subject-like argument (e.g. it controls agreement on the verb). The nominal bearing the \isi{genitive} is not a possessor of an omitted head noun, but an argument of the verb. Note that it is possible to replace the \isi{genitive} by the \isi{absolutive} with no salient change in the meaning of the clause.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:The hips will be a strong medicine}
	\gll	gacbe	c'aq'	darman-na	d-irχʷ-an-te	ca-d\\

\subsection{Transitive verbs}\label{sec:Transitive verbs}
\largerpage[-1]

Simple \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs have two arguments: one is marked with the \isi{ergative} and functions in a subject-like manner, and the other one bears the \isi{absolutive}. Gender/\isi{number} agreement is triggered by the \isi{absolutive} argument. Person agreement can be controlled by the \isi{ergative} or the \isi{absolutive} argument and mostly follows the hierarchy 1,2 > 3 (see \refsec{sec:Person agreement} on \isi{person agreement} for more details and examples). Transitive verbs can be simple underived verbs as the six first verbs in \refex{ex:transitive verbs} and the examples in \refex{ex:Did these people beat you up}, \refex{ex:‎‎I did not steal the stone. I did not kill anyone}, verbs containing various \is{preverb}preverbs, compounds containing transitive \is{light verb}light verbs \refex{ex:The boy stopped him}, \refex{ex:‎‎They taught me to smoke marihuana}, or causativized \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs \refex{ex:This makes the mill spin around}, \refex{ex:‎Marijam was growing cucumbers}.

\subsection{Extended transitive verbs (i.e. ditransitive verbs)}
\label{sec:Extended transitive verbs and ditransitive verbs}

Extended \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs have three arguments bearing the \isi{ergative}, the \isi{absolutive} and a further case. They follow the same agreement rules as simple \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs. This means that the \isi{absolutive} argument triggers the \isi{gender}/\isi{number} agreement. Person agreement is controlled by the \isi{absolutive} or the \isi{ergative} argument, but never by the third argument (reciepient, addressee, etc.). It normally follows the person hierarchy 1, 2 > 3. The extended \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs in \refex{ex:extended di-transitive verbs} all have \isi{dative} arguments in addition to the \isi{ergative} and \isi{absolutive} arguments.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:extended di-transitive verbs}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{lukː-\slash b-ikː-} \sqt{give}
		\ex	\tit{qar b-irq'-\slash qar b-arq'-} \sqt{charge, entrust with}
		\ex	\tit{xadi lukː-\slash xadi b-ikː-} \sqt{marry off}
		\ex	\tit{či-b-iž-aq-\slash či-b-až-aq-} \sqt{show}
	\end{xlist}

	\ex	\label{ex:The snake gave it to me}

	\glt	\sqt{My brother married (me) off to a fellow villager.}
\end{exe}

To this group belong a \isi{number} of verbs expressing violent physical contact \refex{ex:transitive contact verbs}. These verbs have an \isi{absolutive} argument denoting the instrument of the action \refex{ex:He hit with the fist on the jaw of his wife}. The instrument is usually omitted such that we are left with two arguments, the \isi{ergative} \isi{agent} and the \isi{goal} that takes the \isi{dative} or the \tsc{in}-lative \refex{ex:He hit his wife}. The valency frame is typical for this semantic type of verbs and has been described for other East Caucasian languages (\citealp[332\tnd334]{Khalilova2009}; \citealp[476]{Forker2013a}). 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:transitive contact verbs}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{b-uˁrq-\slash b-aˁq-} \sqt{beat, hit}
		\ex	\tit{b-urh-\slash b-erh-} \sqt{knock, strike, bang}
		\ex	\tit{irx-\slash ixʷ-} \sqt{throw at, shoot}
	\end{xlist}

	\ex	\label{ex:He hit with the fist on the jaw of his wife}
	\gll	xːunul-la	qajqaj-t-a-cːe	q'uˁš	b-aˁq-ib	ca-b\\
		woman\tsc{-gen}	jaw\tsc{-pl-obl-in}	fist	\tsc{n-}hit\tsc{.pfv-pret}	\tsc{cop-n}\\
	\glt	\sqt{He hit with the fist on the jaw of his wife.}

	\ex	\label{ex:He hit his wife}
	\gll	xːunul-li-j	b-aˁq-ib	ca-b	hel-i-l\\
		woman\tsc{-obl-dat}	\tsc{n-}hit\tsc{.pfv-pret}	\tsc{cop-n}	that\tsc{-obl-erg}\\
	\glt	\sqt{He hit his wife.}

	\ex	\label{ex:when the other shot into the forehead}
	\gll	itilil-li	ix-ub-le	tupang	antːa-l-cːe	\ldots\\
		other\tsc{-erg}	throw\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb}	weapon	forehead\tsc{-obl-in}\\
	\glt	\sqt{when the other shot into the forehead \ldots}
\end{exe}

However, the verb \tit{b-erh-} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{knock, strike, bang} takes only instruments in the \isi{ergative} or the \isi{comitative} case that do not control the agreement, such that the resulting clauses lack \isi{absolutive} arguments \refex{ex:‎‎‎Ali knocked / beat off the giant with the hand}. The agreement trigger is not overtly present in the clause and cannot be retrieved by speakers. The difference in \isi{gender} agreement goes hand in hand with a difference in the meaning of the clauses: when the neuter singular prefix \tit{b-} is used the event occurred only once; when the neuter plural suffix is used the knocking-event occurred repeatedly such that the meaning is rather \sqt{beat off}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎Ali knocked / beat off the giant with the hand}
	\gll	ʡaˁli-l	weliχan-ni-j	naˁq-li	/	naˁq-li-cːella b-erh-ib	/	d-erh-ib\\
		Ali\tsc{-erg}	giant\tsc{-obl-dat}	hand\tsc{-erg} / hand\tsc{-obl-comit}	\tsc{n-}strike\tsc{.pfv-pret}	/	\tsc{npl-}strike\tsc{.pfv-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎Ali knocked\slash beat off the giant with the hand.} (E)
\end{exe}

Another group of extended \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs are verbs of speech that take an addressee argument in the \tsc{in}-lative \xxref{ex:verbs of speech addressees}{ex:I asked Isakadi}. Their \isi{absolutive} argument is either a clause \refex{ex:Why did he not tell us that the water does not flow, they said}, \refex{ex:I asked Isakadi}, or a noun that refers to the speech event such as \textit{χabar} `story' \refex{ex:He tells the story}.\largerpage[-1]

\subsection{Bivalent verbs with lexicalized objects and other rare constructions with bivalent verbs}
\label{sec:Bivalent verbs with frozen objects}

There are a couple of verbs with \isi{ergative} subject-like arguments that have fixed, lexicalized objects that control the \isi{gender}/\isi{number} agreement on the verb, but cannot be exchanged with other nominals because they are constitutive for the meaning of the predicate \refex{ex:Bivalent verbs with frozen objectsValency}. For such verbs, it is impossible to add another nominal in the \isi{absolutive}, because the object-like position is already occupied by the lexicalized object. However, it is not always clear whether the lexicalized object controls the \isi{gender} agreement on the verb or whether the \isi{gender} agreement is frozen. From a semantic point of view, the verbs can be analyzed as bivalent or trivalent. The \isi{bivalent verbs} have additional arguments in the \isi{dative} \refex{ex:Brother called you} or \tsc{in}-essive \refex{ex:His wife begged him, Don't go} or occasionally in other cases \refex{ex:I am hugging you}. Verbs of speech preferably make use of the \tsc{in}-essive whereas other verbs mostly employ the \isi{dative}. Some of these verbs take additional complement clauses.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Bivalent verbs with frozen objectsValency}
	\begin{xlist}

\end{exe}

Some of the frozen objects occur in more than one construction. For instance, \tit{urk'ec'i}, when combined with a verb, can occur in the \isi{ergative} construction with an agentive \isi{experiencer} \refex{ex:I pity the convicted}, in a construction with a \isi{dative} \isi{experiencer} \refex{ex:I pity Madina's sons@b}, and together with an \isi{experiencer} in the \isi{genitive} \refex{ex:I pity Madina's sons@c}. The \isi{stimulus} is always a \isi{goal} or beneficiary-like argument and therefore takes the \isi{dative}. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:I pity the convicted}

Note that Sanzhi also has a range of \is{compound verb}compound verbs with \isi{nouns} marked by the \isi{genitive} or by \is{spatial postposition}spatial postpositions. However, the \isi{nouns} used in such constructions are not lexicalized objects but nominal parts of \is{compound verb}compound verbs. For examples see \refsec{ssec:compoundswithnouns}.

\subsection{Bivalent affective verbs}
\label{sec:Bivalent affective verbs}
Bivalent \is{affective verb}affective verbs are a relatively small class of \is{two-place verb}two-place verbs with epxeriential\slash affective semantics \refex{ex:bivalent affective verbs}. They express unintentional and uncontrollable perception, emotion, volition, cognitive activities and other non-agentive events and situations. 


\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:bivalent affective verbs}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{či-b-ig-\slash či-b-ag-} \sqt{see}
		\ex	\tit{t'am b-iq'-\slash t'am b-aq'-} \sqt{hear}
		\ex	\tit{b-ikː-} \sqt{want, like, love}
		\ex	\tit{b-irʁ-\slash b-arʁ-} \sqt{understand}
		\ex	\tit{qum urt-\slash qum ert-} \sqt{forget}
		\ex	\tit{b-alχ-\slash b-aχ-} \sqt{know}
		\ex	\tit{b-urkː-\slash b-arkː-} \sqt{find}
		\ex	\tit{han b-irk-\slash han b-irk-} \sqt{remember, seem}
		\ex	\tit{b-ičː-aq-} \sqt{like, love}
		\ex	\tit{či-b-b-irt'-\slash či-b-b-et'-} \sqt{be bored}
		\ex	\tit{b-irt'-\slash b-et'-} \sqt{be bored}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Most bivalent \is{affective verb}affective verbs have an \isi{experiencer} argument in the \isi{dative} and a \isi{stimulus} argument in the \isi{absolutive}. They follow the same agreement rules as \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs, i.e. \isi{gender}/\isi{number} agreement with the \isi{absolutive} argument and \isi{person agreement} is ruled by the hierarchy 1, 2 > 3 \refex{ex:I did not forget anythingA}, \refex{ex:I know a good place}, and/or it is the \isi{experiencer} that controls the agreement \refex{ex:I did not forget anythingA}, \refex{ex:I know a good place}, or it is invariably third person \refex{ex:I forgot everythingA}, \refex{ex:‎‎I am angry with Sanzhiat}. 


\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:I did not forget anythingA}
	\gll	dam	qum.a.art-id	cik'al\\
		\tsc{1sg.dat}	forget\tsc{.ipfv.neg-hab.pst.1}	anything\\
	\glt	\sqt{I did not forget anything.}

	\ex	\label{ex:I know a good place}
	\gll	dam	ʡaˁħ	musːa	b-alχ-ad\\
		\tsc{1sg.dat}	good	place	\tsc{n-}know\tsc{.ipfv-1.prs}\\
	\glt	\sqt{I know a good place.}
	
\end{exe}


When inflected for some tenses such as the \isi{habitual past}, the compound present \refex{ex:I do not see this person, whether it is female or male} or the future \refex{ex:‎‎I will never forget you}, \refex{ex:I know her, this Salihat} and in some types of subordinate clauses certain affective predicates allow for the \isi{experiencer} to bear the \isi{ergative} instead of the \isi{dative} case. The \isi{ergative} alignment pattern is more common in other Dargwa varieties such as Icari Dargwa, and has been investigated from a diachronic perspective in \citet{Ganenkov2013}. In Sanzhi Dargwa, it is less common and the precise conditions that allow for \isi{ergative} experiencers still need further investigation. In any case, it follows the same agreement rules as \isi{dative} experiencers, e.g. in \refex{ex:I do not see this person, whether it is female or male} \isi{person agreement} is controlled by the \isi{ergative} \isi{experiencer} and in \refex{ex:‎‎I will never forget you} by the \isi{absolutive} \isi{stimulus}. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:I do not see this person, whether it is female or male}
	\gll	či-w-ig-ul	akːʷa-di	du-l	heχ	admi,	xːunul=el	murgul=el\\
		\tsc{spr-m-}see\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{cop.neg-1}	\tsc{1sg-erg}	\tsc{dem.down}	person		woman\tsc{=indq}		masculine\tsc{=indq}\\
	\glt	\sqt{I do not see this person (on the picture), whether it is female or male.}
	
			\ex	\label{ex:‎‎I will never forget you}
	\gll	u	du-l	nikagda	qum.a.art-an=de\\
		\tsc{2sg}	\tsc{1sg-erg}	never	forget\tsc{.ipfv.neg-ptcp=2sg}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎I will never forget you.}
	
	\ex	\label{ex:I know her, this Salihat}
	\gll	na	it	du-l	r-alχ-an=q'al	het	Saliħaˁt\\
		now	that	\tsc{1sg-erg}	\tsc{f-}know\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp=prt}	that	Salikhat\\
	\glt	\sqt{I know her, that Salihat.}

\end{exe}



It is not always possible to determine if a specific examples follows the person hierarchy or if it is the \isi{experiencer}, who controls the agreement (which can also be formulated as semantic role hierarchy: \isi{experiencer} > \isi{stimulus}). For instance, in \refex{ex:You (pl.) bored me, I said} the \isi{person agreement} \isi{enclitic} on the verb =\textit{da} expresses first person singular or plural and second person plural agreement, such that it could be either the \isi{experiencer} (in accordance with the \isi{experiencer} controlling agreement independently of person) or the \isi{stimulus} (in accordance with the hierarchy) that functions as controller. Similarly, in both \refex{ex:I did not forget anythingA} and \refex{ex:You (pl.) bored me, I said}, a first person \isi{experiencer} controls the agreement suffix, which can be explained by the person hierarchy or by the semantic role hierarchy). 


\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:You (pl.) bored me, I said}
	\gll	či-d-d-et'-ib-le=da,	haʔ-ib=da,	ušːa	dam\\
		\tsc{spr-1/2pl-1/2pl-}bore\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb=1/2pl}	say\tsc{.pfv-pret=1}	\tsc{1pl}	\tsc{1sg.dat}\\
	\glt	\sqt{``You (pl.) bored me,'' I said.}
\end{exe}


In general, \isi{experiencer} verbs seem to allow for a higher degree of variation concerning \isi{person agreement} than \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs. This includes the fact that under certain circumstances the \isi{person agreement} is third person although the clause contains a first or second person \isi{dative} pronoun in the semantic role of \isi{experiencer}. For instance, with the verb `forget' both \isi{person agreement} enclitics and third \isi{person agreement} are found in the Sanzhi corpus, but third \isi{person agreement} prevails. Thus, in \refex{ex:‎‎I will never forget you} we find second person singular controlled by the \isi{stimulus} and \refex{ex:I did not forget anythingA} the verb agrees with the \isi{experiencer} in the \isi{dative} (first person singular). By contrast, in \refex{ex:I forgot everythingA} and \refex{ex:I forget (it), I do not remember it.} the agreement is third person instead of the expected first \isi{person agreement}. 
%

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:I forgot everythingA}
	\gll	qum.ert-ur-re	ca-d	dam	cik'al\\
		forget\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb}	\tsc{cop-npl}	\tsc{1sg.dat}	thing\\
	\glt	\sqt{I have forgotten everything.}
	
		\ex	\label{ex:I forget (it), I do not remember it.}
	\gll	qum.urt-u dam, han kalg-unne akːu\\
		forget\tsc{.ipfv-prs.3}	\tsc{1sg.dat}	remember remain.\tsc{ipfv-icvb} \tsc{cop.neg}\\
	\glt	\sqt{I forget (it), I do not remember it.}
	
\end{exe}

As the following minimal pair shows, the variation that the verb `forget' shows between \isi{person agreement} and invariably third person does not imply any differences in meaning and is not tied to certain TAM forms (as it is the case for \isi{ergative} experiencers, which are only available for a restricted \isi{number} of TAM forms, but for all \is{affective verb}affective verbs). The variation includes forms with person suffixes and forms with person enclitics alike. One and the same tense form can show variation as the following two examples of the preterite demonstrate. The first sentence \refex{ex:I (masc.) forgot my own village.A} shows \isi{person agreement} with the first person \isi{experiencer} whereas the second sentence \refex{ex:I (masc.) forgot my own village.B} has a verb form that corresponds to the third person preterite (i.e. no person \isi{enclitic}, no \isi{copula}). 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:I (masc.) forgot my own village.A}
	\gll	dam qum.ert-ur=da w-ah-la šːi\\
	\tsc{1sg.dat} 	forget\tsc{.pfv-pret=1} \tsc{m}-owner-\tsc{gen} village\\
	\glt	\sqt{I (masc.) forgot my own village.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:I (masc.) forgot my own village.B}
	\gll	dam qum.ert-ur w-ah-la šːi\\
		\tsc{1sg.dat} 	forget\tsc{.pfv-pret} \tsc{m}-owner-\tsc{gen} village\\
	\glt	\sqt{I (masc.) forgot my own village.} (E)
\end{exe}

Based on the data collected so far I am not able to explain the variation by means of linguistic or extralinguistic factors. Another, more general question concerns the nature of the third person forms in \refex{ex:I forgot everythingA}, \refex{ex:I forget (it), I do not remember it.}, \refex{ex:I (masc.) forgot my own village.B}, and other \is{affective verb}affective verbs below, for which three different hypotheses could be suggested. First, we can perhaps analyze it as third \isi{person agreement} controlled by the \isi{absolutive} \isi{patient} that overrules the agreement hierarchies stated above. It would then follow the \isi{ergative} pattern analogously to the \isi{ergative} agreement attested in certain TAM forms and discussed in \refsec{ssec:Person agreement rules}. Alternatively, we can claim that we deal with `suspended \isi{person agreement}' in the sense that the verb shows the default \isi{person agreement} form, namely third person, but this form does not underlie control but shows actually the lack of an \isi{agreement controller}. 

A third alternative would be to suggest that the verbs in \refex{ex:I forgot everythingA} and \refex{ex:I forget (it), I do not remember it.} are one-place verbs and the \isi{dative} pronouns are not genuine arguments of the verb but something like adjuncts and can therefore not control the agreement.\footnote{If this approach can be corroborated by further research, then the discussed verbs and examples have to be classified as monovalent \is{affective verb}affective verbs. For the sake of the argumentation and because I am unable to draw a conclusion at the present moment I prefer to leave this part of the section where it is.} This argumentation could be supported by the fact that even the verbs `see' and `hear', which are normally used as two-place \is{affective verb}affective verbs can be used as one-place \isi{bivalent verbs} with the meanings `be visible' and `be audible'. In that case normally the \isi{dative} \isi{experiencer} can be omitted. Thus, \refex{ex:‎I began to see the mountains2} can be used with a \isi{dative} pronoun, in which case two translations are possible \sqt{‎I began to see the mountains.} or \sqt{The mountains started to be visible to me.} If the pronoun is omitted, then the only translation is \sqt{The mountains started to be visible.}

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎I began to see the mountains2}
	\gll	(dam)	dubur-te	či-d-ig-ul	d-aʔ	ašː-ib\\
		\tsc{1sg.dat}	mountain\tsc{-pl}	\tsc{spr-npl-}see\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{npl-}begin	begin\tsc{.pfv-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎I began to see the mountains.} OR \sqt{The mountains started to be visible to me.} (E)
\end{exe}


Similarly, the verb \sqt{remember} is a \isi{compound verb} in which the verbal part consists of the otherwise intransitive \isi{light verb} \tit{b-ik-} \sqt{occur}. I found only third \isi{person agreement} in all corpus examples as well as in elicitation, which suggests that the \isi{dative} \isi{experiencer} is syntactically not an argument but an adjunct such as a \isi{goal} \refex{ex:There I also remembered my family remember}. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:There I also remembered my family remember}
	\gll	heχ-tːu-b	han	b-ič-ib	dam	kulpat=ra\\
		\tsc{dem.down}\tsc{-loc-hpl}	remember	\tsc{hpl-}occur\tsc{.pfv-pret}	\tsc{1sg.dat}	family\tsc{=add}\\
	\glt	\sqt{There I also remembered my family.}
\end{exe}


There are some more predicates that can be classified as two-place affective predicates because they come with two semantic roles, an \isi{experiencer} and a \isi{stimulus}, but which differ from the predicates discussed so far in this section. First of all, there are two \isi{copula} constructions with adverbials that mean `needed' \refex{ex:copula constructions with absolutive stimulus}. In these constructions the \isi{absolutive} \isi{stimulus} functions as \isi{copula} subject and thus person and \isi{gender} \isi{agreement controller} \refex{ex:I need your help.AFF}, or alternatively complement clauses can be used. The \isi{dative} can be classified as \isi{copula} predicate and its use is optional. The predicates therefore behave in the same way as what has been said above about `see' and `hear', i.e., they can be used as monovalent predicates without an \isi{experiencer} in impersonal constructions or as bivalent \is{affective verb}affective verbs.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:copula constructions with absolutive stimulus}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{ʡaˁʁuni-l ca-b} \sqt{need, be necessary}\footnote{This predicate can also occur with an \isi{experiencer} argument in the \isi{absolutive} that takes over the role as \isi{copula} subject and controls agreement. See example \refex{ex:This person needs to be there in the morning at 8 o'clockAA} in \refsec{General remarks on gender/number agreement}.}
		\ex	\tit{ħaˁžat-le ca-b} \sqt{need, be necessary}
	\end{xlist}
	
	
	\ex	\label{ex:I need your help.AFF}
	\gll	dam	ħaˁžat-le	ca-b	ala	kumek\\
		\tsc{1sg.dat}	need-\tsc{advz}	\tsc{cop-n}	\tsc{2sg.gen}	help\\
	\glt	\sqt{I need your help.} (E)
\end{exe}


There are two bivalent \is{affective verb}affective verbs that do not show person or \isi{gender} agreement, but invariable third person forms and the default \isi{gender} \isi{agreement prefix} \textit{d}- \refex{ex:PITYangry}.\footnote{The same lexical item \textit{urk'ec'i} `pity' is used in another semantically very similar predicate together with the lexical verb `do, make'. In that construction the lexical verb has the \isi{agreement prefix} \textit{b}- for neuter singular \refex{ex:I pity the convicted}. Therefore, the \isi{agreement prefix} \textit{d}- in \refex{ex:PITYangry} cannot be controlled by the items preceding the verbs but must be a default prefix. In general, both \textit{b}- and \textit{d}- function as default agreement exponents in a \isi{number} of different constructions (\refsec{General remarks on gender/number agreement}).} The verb \tit{simi d-uq-\slash simi d-ulq-} \sqt{be angry}, already mentioned in \refsec{sec:Extended intransitive verbs}, is a one-place verb that can be changed into a \isi{two-place verb} with a further \isi{experiencer}/\isi{goal} argument in the \isi{dative} by adding the spatial \isi{preverb} \tit{či-} to it \refex{ex:‎‎I am angry with Sanzhiat}. This \isi{experiencer}/\isi{goal} argument can never control \isi{person agreement} (i.e. first \isi{person agreement} in the examples below is ungrammatical) and thus the \isi{person agreement} is always third person. The identical lexical verb with the same \isi{preverb} con also occur in a compound with \textit{urk'ec'i} `pity' with exactly the same morphosyntactic properties \refex{ex:I pity Madina's sons@b}. Note that in \refex{ex:I pity Madina's sons@c} the \isi{dative} pronoun has been replaced by a \isi{genitive} possessor that now encodes the semantic role of \isi{experiencer}. This examples is an indication that the \isi{dative} pronouns in the other examples \refex{ex:‎‎I am angry with Sanzhiat} and \refex{ex:I pity Madina's sons@b} are not arguments but adjuncts, perhaps comparable to external possessor that can be expressed in the \isi{dative} or in the \isi{genitive}. 
%


\begin{exe} 
\ex	\label{ex:PITYangry}
\begin{xlist}
		\ex \tit{ d-uq-\slash simi d-ulq-} \sqt{be angry}
		\ex \tit{urk'ec'i d-uq-\slash urk'ec'i d-ulq-} \sqt{pity}
\end{xlist}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎I am angry with Sanzhiat}
	\gll	dam	simi	či-d-ulq-u	Sanžijat-li-j\\

		\glt	\sqt{I pity Madina's sons.} (lit. My pity is directed onto Madina's son.) (E)	
\end{exe}

Finally there are a few constructions with \isi{dative} experiencers and a source-like or cause-like \isi{stimulus} arguments that bear the \tsc{ante}-\isi{ablative} \refex{embarrassed constructions}. This is the same case that is used by some monovalent \isi{experiential} verbs for marking the source/cause-like arguments \refex{ex:Are you afraid of your wife? he says.}. In these constructions, there is again invariable third \isi{person agreement} and default neuter singular \isi{gender} agreement that is frozen and not controlled by any of the constituents \xxref{ex:Hey, Kurban, I am ashamed in front of you}{ex:I miss youValency}.

\begin{exe} 
\ex \label{embarrassed constructions}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\tit{c'aχ ka-b-ircː-\slash c'aχ ka-b-icː; c'aχ-le ca-b} \sqt{feel ashamed, be/become embarrassed}

		\ex	\tit{b-irt'-\slash b-et'-} \sqt{long for}

\subsection{Labile verbs}
\label{sec:Labile verbs}

Sanzhi Dargwa has a \isi{number} of \isi{labile verbs} that can be used as \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs (with the corresponding morphology) or as \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs. Because in Sanzhi arguments can be omitted and are often omitted if their reference is clear from the context, at times it can be difficult to identify \isi{labile verbs}. Furthermore, occasionally \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs occur in impersonal constructions without arguments that could syntactically be defined as subjects or semantically identified as agents \refex{ex:It used to snow a lotA}, \refex{ex:He was not shaking like this (i.e. not able to move)}. Outside of the constructions shown in \refex{ex:It used to snow a lotA} and \refex{ex:He was not shaking like this (i.e. not able to move)}, the verb \tit{b-irq'-} (\tsc{ipfv})\slash\tit{b-arq'-} (\tsc{pfv}) is transitive and I therefore do not include it in the list of \isi{labile verbs}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:It used to snow a lotA}
	\gll	χːula-ce	duˁħi	b-irq'-iri\\
		big\tsc{-dd.sg}	snow	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.ipfv-hab.pst.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{It used to snow a lot.}

	\ex	\label{ex:He was not shaking like this (i.e. not able to move)}
	\gll	hež-itːe	hak'	w-irq'-ul	akːʷ-i\\
		this\tsc{-advz}	shake	\tsc{m-}do\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{cop.neg-hab.pst}\\
	\glt	\sqt{He was not shaking like this (i.e. he was not able to move).}
\end{exe}

Sanzhi Dargwa makes use of different suffixes for the \isi{imperative} of many intransitive and \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs, and the stem augment vowels in the \isi{prohibitive} and the \isi{habitual present} also differ according to transitivity. Thus, the verbal morphology provides decisive clues for deciding whether a verb is used intransitively or transitively.

The majority of the \isi{labile verbs} are S=P-labile, preserving the argument with the patientive semantic role \refex{ex:S=P labile verbs}. The first example sentence in \refex{ex:The barn burnt} shows the intransitive use, and the second one in \refex{ex:The people burn the house with fire} illustrates the transitive use.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:S=P labile verbs}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex \tit{(b-)ikːʷ-} \sqt{burn} (not specified for aspect)

		\ex	\tit{b-erc'-} (\tsc{pfv})\slash\tit{b-uc'-} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{fry, roast, bake}
		\ex	\tit{b-ic'-} (\tsc{pfv})\slash\tit{b-irc'-} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{fill}
		\ex	\tit{b-aˁč} (\tsc{pfv})\slash\tit{b-aˁlč} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{squeeze, break, crush, crack, trample}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}


\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:The barn burnt}
	\gll	daˁrqʷ	b-ikː-ub\\
		barn	\tsc{n-}burn\tsc{-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{The barn burnt.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:The people burn the house with fire}
	\gll	χalq'-li	qal	c'a-l	b-ikː-ul	ca-b\\
		people\tsc{-erg}	house	fire\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{n-}burn-\tsc{icvb}	\tsc{cop-n}\\
	\glt	\sqt{The people burn the house with fire.} (E)
\end{exe}

The \isi{prohibitive} of the intransitive clause is given in \refex{ex:‎‎‎Barn, do not burn}, and the \isi{prohibitive} of the transitive can be found in \refex{ex:‎Eh boy, do not burn the house}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎Barn, do not burn}
	\gll	daˁrqʷ,	ma-jkː-ut!\\
		barn	\tsc{proh-}burn\tsc{-proh.sg}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎Barn, do not burn!} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:‎Eh boy, do not burn the house}
	\gll	ej	durħuˁ,		qal	ma-jkːʷ-it!\\
		eh	boy	house	\tsc{proh-}burn\tsc{-proh.sg}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎Eh boy, do not burn the house!} (E)
\end{exe}


I found a few S=A \isi{labile verbs} that preserve the subject-like argument, namely:\largerpage

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:S=A labile verbs}

Translational equivalents of \sqt{read} are also labile in a \isi{number} of other East Caucasian languages (e.g. in Icari Dargwa, \citealp[154\tnd155]{Sumbatova.Mutalov2003}, and in Hinuq, \citealp[492]{Forker2013a}). Note that lability surfaces only with the \isi{imperfective aspect} of those verbs that can be used intransitively or transitively. This means that the perfective stems always occur in transitive constructions.

		\glt	\sqt{Read the book!\slash Do not read the book!} (E)
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Furthermore, an optional P argument can be added in the intransitive use. This argument needs to be semantically plural and indefinite, and is marked with the \isi{ergative} case \refex{ex:Now Sanijat reads books}. This construction is called ``\isi{antipassive}'' in Dargwa languages and treated in more detail in \refsec{sec:Antipassive}.

\section{Modification of valency patterns}
\label{cpt:Modification of valency patterns}

Sanzhi Dargwa has two major means of modifying the valency patterns of verbs, the \isi{antipassive} as a detransitivizing operation (\refsec{sec:Antipassive}), and the \isi{causative} as an argument-increasing operation (\refsec{sec:Causativization}). There are no potential constructions, which in other East Caucasian languages are used to detransitive verbs. There is also no biabsolutive construction, which would allow for the use of two \isi{absolutive} arguments with a \isi{transitive verb}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Antipassive}
\label{sec:Antipassive}

Sanzhi Dargwa has an \isi{antipassive} that is formed by reversing the case marking of A and P in a clause with a canonical transitive predicate \refexrange{ex:S/he sews a dress@63a}{ex:She is a dressmaker@63b}. Since both A and P are obligatorily arguments in the \isi{antipassive} construction, it is not an argument-decreasing operation, although the A argument is frequently covert in examples from natural texts. The verb remains unmarked, but the \isi{gender}/\isi{number} agreement on the verb changes. Due to the lack of formal marking on the verb the \isi{antipassive} in Sanzhi is not a typical \isi{antipassive} from a typological perspective \citep{Polinsky2005}. 

\begin{exe}

		\ex	\isi{ergative} construction \label{ex:S/he sews a dress@63a}\\
		\gll	it-i-l	kːurtːi	b-urχ-u\\
			that\tsc{-obl-erg}	dress	\tsc{n-}sew\tsc{.ipfv-prs.3}\\
		\glt	\sqt{S/he sews a dress.} (E) 

		\ex	\isi{antipassive} construction \label{ex:She is a dressmaker@63b}\\
		\gll	it	kurtːi-l	r-urχ-u \\
			that	dress\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{f-}sew\tsc{.ipfv-prs.3}\\
		\glt	\sqt{She is a dressmaker.} OR \sqt{She habitually sews dresses.} (E)

\end{exe}

Apart from being restricted to only one predicate class, namely canonical \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs, the \isi{antipassive} is additionally constrained in other ways:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Only the A argument can be omitted. In texts, it is frequently omitted as the examples in \refex{ex:Frying fish, eating fruits we stayed} and \refex{ex:‎‎They taught me to smoke marihuana} show. The overt presence of the P argument is obligatory in order to have an \isi{antipassive} construction, and it is usually the best indicator of the \isi{antipassive} because the \isi{gender} agreement affixes do not unambiguously indicate the controller.

	\item	It is largely (if not fully) restricted to imperfective verb stems and consequently to those tenses that are available for verbs with imperfective stems such as, for instance, the compound present, the compound past, the \isi{habitual present}, the \isi{habitual past}, the future forms and the obligative forms. Other tenses, e.g. the preterite or the \isi{resultative}, cannot be used for \isi{antipassive} constructions because they are basically formed from the perfective stems. It can also occur in subordinate clauses if the respective clause types allow for verb forms based on stems with \isi{imperfective aspect}. For instance, \refex{ex:Frying fish, eating fruits we stayed} and \refex{ex:‎When they played with the frog, the boy and his dog got tired and played down to sleep} show \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses with \isi{antipassive} constructions, \refex{ex:‎‎They taught me to smoke marihuana} shows a complement clause, and \refex{ex:the drinking friends}  a \isi{relative clause}. In \refex{ex:Frying fish, eating fruits we stayed} the verb in the main clause is intransitive. Due to the \isi{antipassive} constructions in the preceding sentences the subject that is shared in all three clauses would be in the \isi{absolutive} case if it would occur overtly. At the first glance, one might think that the \isi{antipassive} has been used in order to make argument sharing across the three clauses possible, but this is not the case. There are (almost) no syntactic restrictions on co-reference and shared argument between adverbial and main clauses \refex{ex:Frying fish, eating fruits we stayed}. Therefore, the use of standard transitive constructions with \isi{ergative} subjects would be equally grammatical in the two \is{adverbial clause}adverbial clauses. In other words, the \isi{antipassive} is not needed for pivot modulation. On the contrary, it is used for purely semantic reasons.

			drinking\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{hpl-}drink\tsc{.ipfv-ptcp}	friend\tsc{-pl}\\
		\glt	\sqt{the drinking friends}
	\end{exe}

	\item	Not all \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs allow for the \isi{antipassive} construction. The majority of \isi{antipassive} clauses in the Sanzhi corpus contain either of the three verbs \tit{b-uk-} \sqt{eat} \refex{ex:I (fem.) am eating bread}, \tit{b-učː-} \sqt{drink, consume, smoke} \refex{ex:‎‎They taught me to smoke marihuana}, \refex{ex:the drinking friends}, and \tit{b-irq'-} \sqt{do, make, be busy} \refex{ex:‎When they played with the frog, the boy and his dog got tired and played down to sleep}, \refex{ex:Grandfather used to work}, but a few more are also attested \refex{ex:She reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds@varB}. Typical verbs for which the \isi{antipassive} is not available are verbs for which it is unclear what the result of the action that they denote would be \refex{ex:The car is pushing Rashid@64b}.\footnote{An anonymous reviewer pointed out that the unavialability of the \isi{antipassive} reading in \refex{ex:The car is pushing Rashid@64b} might also be due to the fact that the \isi{antipassive} expresses repeated or habitual situations. This is possible and more research is needed to give a conclusive answer for why this example cannot be interpreted as \isi{antipassive}.} 
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:Rashid get away from the car@64}
		\begin{xlist}
			\ex	\isi{ergative} construction \label{ex:Rashid is pushing the car@64a} \\
			\gll	Rašid-li	mašin	qːurt	b-irq'-ul ca-b\\

			\glt	\sqt{A/the car is pushing Rashid.} (NOT: \sqt{Rashid is pushing a/the car.})~(E)
		\end{xlist}
	\end{exe}

	\item	The \isi{antipassive} is not available with first or second person patients. There are no person restrictions on the \isi{agent} \refex{ex:I (fem.) am eating bread}, \refex{ex:You do not drink water}, but the \isi{patient} must be third person.
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:I (fem.) am eating bread}
		\gll	du	t'ult'-li	r-uk-un-ne=da\\
			\tsc{1sg}	bread\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{f-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-pret-cvb=1}\\
		\glt	\sqt{I (fem.) am eating bread.} (E)
	\end{exe}

	\item	There are animacy restrictions: it is impossible for A and P to be both animate or both inanimate. The last two constraints are not really syntactic in nature since the resulting clauses are grammatical. However, the meaning would not be what is intended. If we switch the case marking of A and P in \refex{ex:The monster is eating me} the outcome is simply a normal clause in which the roles of A and P have been reversed \refex{ex:I am eating the monster.}. 
	%
	\begin{exe}
		\ex	\label{ex:The monster and me are eating each other}
		\begin{xlist}
			\ex	\label{ex:The monster is eating me}
			\gll	aždaha-l	du	∅-ukː-unne=da\\
				monster\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{1sg}	\tsc{m-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=1}\\
			\glt	\sqt{The monster is eating me.} (E)
	
			\ex	\label{ex:I am eating the monster.}
			\gll	du-l	aždaha	b-ukː-unne=da\\
				\tsc{1sg-erg}	monster	\tsc{n-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=1}\\
			\glt	\sqt{I am eating the monster.} (NOT: \sqt{The monster is eating me.}) (E)
		\end{xlist}
	\end{exe}
\end{enumerate}

Syntactically, the \isi{antipassive} is a detransitivizing operation. The main proof for this is, of course, that the A argument occurs in the \isi{absolutive} case and controls the \isi{gender} agreement, whereas the P argument takes the \isi{ergative} case. The functional range of the \isi{ergative} comprises not only the expression of agents, but also of other semantic roles with a more peripheral status (adjuncts), most notably instruments (\refsec{sssec:Ergative}). The \isi{ergative} P of the \isi{antipassive} largely fits into this range. Furthermore, the distinction between suffixes for intransitive and for \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs that is made in the \isi{imperative} and in the \isi{prohibitive} shows that verbs in the \isi{antipassive} construction are detransitivized. Thus, the \isi{prohibitive} suffixes for \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs are \tit{-ut} (\tsc{sg})\slash\tit{-utːaja} (\tsc{pl}) with the stem augment vowel \tit{u}, whereas the \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs have \tit{-it} (\tsc{sg})\slash\tit{-itːaja} (\tsc{pl}) with the stem augment \textit{i} (\refsec{sec:prohibitive}). The \isi{antipassive} construction requires the same \isi{prohibitive} suffix as \is{intransitive verb}intransitive verbs \refex{ex:antipassive drink water}, which is ungrammatical in the \isi{ergative} construction \refex{ex: ergative drink water}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\isi{antipassive} construction	\label{ex:antipassive drink water}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\label{ex:You do not drink water}
		\gll	ušːa hin-ni	ma-d-učː-utːaja!\\
			\tsc{2pl}	water\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{proh-1/2pl-}drink\tsc{.ipfv-proh.pl}\\
		\glt	\sqt{You do not drink water (regularly)!} (E)
	
		\ex	\label{ex:Do (always) not eat meat!}
		\gll	dig-li ma-w-k-ut!\\
			meat\tsc{-erg} \tsc{proh-m-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-proh.sg}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Do not (always) eat meat!} (said to a man) (E)
	\end{xlist}\pagebreak
	
	\ex	\isi{ergative} construction	\label{ex: ergative drink water}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\label{ex:You do not drink the water}
		\gll	ušːa-l		hin ma-d-učː-itːaja!\\
			\tsc{2pl-erg}	water \tsc{proh-npl-}drink\tsc{.ipfv-proh.pl}\\
		\glt	\sqt{You do not drink the water!} (E)
	
		\ex	\label{ex:Do not eat the meat!}
		\gll	dig ma-b-uk-it!\\
			meat	\tsc{proh-n-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-proh.sg}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Do not eat the meat!} (E)
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The major problem in the analysis of \isi{antipassive} constructions concerns the closeness to S=A \isi{labile verbs} that can be used intransitively and transitively, thereby preserving the \isi{agent} argument (\refsec{sec:Labile verbs}). For instance, the imperfective stem of the verb \tit{b-elč'-} (\tsc{pfv})\slash\tit{b-uč'-} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{read, learn, study, sing} can be used in an intransitive construction. When adding the \isi{ergative} adjunct \tit{student-li} (student\tsc{-erg}) to \refex{ex:She reads / studies} the translation is unambiguously \sqt{she studies (at a university as a student)}. The same verb can be used in a transitive construction with an \isi{ergative} \isi{agent} and an \isi{absolutive} \isi{patient} \refex{ex:S/he reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds@varA}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:She reads / studies}
	\gll	it	r-uč'-unne	ca-r\\
		that	\tsc{f-}read\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{cop-f}\\
	\glt	\sqt{She reads\slash studies.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:S/he reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds@varA}
	\gll	it-i-l	turk-me	d-uč'-unne	ca-d\\
		that\tsc{-obl-erg}	nasheed\tsc{-pl}	\tsc{npl-}read\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{cop-npl}\\
	\glt	\sqt{S/he reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds.} (E)
\end{exe}

In the \isi{antipassive} construction, to the intransitive clause in \refex{ex:She reads / studies} a P argument in the plural marked with the \isi{ergative} case is added \refex{ex:She reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds@varB}. The presence of the P argument is the only difference between the two sentences \refex{ex:She reads / studies} and \refex{ex:She reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds@varB}. Thus, instead of speaking of an \isi{antipassive} construction we can also say that Sanzhi has a \isi{number} of S=A \isi{labile verbs} that are used intransitively with an optional nominal in the \isi{ergative} that has syntactically rather the status of an adjunct.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:She reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds@varB}
	\gll	it	turk-m-a-l	r-uč'-unne	ca-r\\
		that	nasheed\tsc{-pl-obl-erg}	\tsc{f-}read\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{cop-f}\\
	\glt	\sqt{She reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds.} (E)
\end{exe}

The verb \tit{b-irq'-} (\tsc{ipfv})\slash\tit{b-arq'-} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{do, make, be busy} belongs to the verbs that frequently occur in \isi{antipassive} constructions \refex{ex:‎When they played with the frog, the boy and his dog got tired and played down to sleep} and can also be used intransitively without any P argument \refex{ex:She is busy}. For this verb, there is a further possibility of use in weather constructions in which there is no A argument \refex{ex:It used to snow a lotA}. The latter construction thus resembles S=P-\isi{labile verbs} (\refsec{sec:Labile verbs}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:She is busy}
	\gll	it	r-irq'-ul	ca-r\\
		that	\tsc{f-}do\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{cop-f}\\
	\glt	\sqt{She is busy.} (E)
\end{exe}

In sum, we can divide verbs in Sanzhi into three classes:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	the class of verbs that do not allow for the \isi{antipassive} construction at all as exemplified by \refex{ex:Rashid get away from the car@64} above
	\item	the class of S=A \isi{labile verbs} that allow for transitive and intransitive use with or without a \isi{patient} such as \tit{b-irq'-} (\tsc{ipfv}) (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{do, make, be busy} and \tit{b-uč'-} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{read, learn, study, sing}; if an \isi{ergative} \isi{patient} is present we can speak of the \isi{antipassive} construction \refex{ex:‎When they played with the frog, the boy and his dog got tired and played down to sleep}, \refex{ex:She reads (i.e. sings) nasheeds@varB}
	\item	the class of verbs that form an \isi{antipassive} with an obligatory P argument that can never be omitted; the verb \tit{b-ux-} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{tell} belongs to the latter class since in clauses such as \refex{ex:He tells many stories} the \isi{patient} needs to occur overtly
\end{enumerate}

The use of antipassives is semantically rather than syntactically motivated. It has habitual semantics, which is typical for antipassives in general and antipassives in East Caucasian languages in particular \refex{ex:She is a dressmaker@63b} (see, e.g., \citealp{vandenBergManuscript}, \citealp{Tatevosov2011}, \citealp{ComrieEtAlXXXX}). Most notably, in all corpus examples the P argument is indefinite and usually in the plural or it has the meaning of a mass noun. Morphologically singular P arguments are only allowed if they can have mass noun readings. The P argument does not refer to a particular, specified object, but is semantically demoted. The sentences refer to repeatedly or habitually occurring actions. For instance, in \refex{ex:Grandfather used to work} the speaker was talking about the life of her grandfather and how he used to be, which types of work he used to do.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Grandfather used to work}
	\gll	χatːaj	ʡaˁči-l	w-irq'-i, \ldots\\
		grandfather	work\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{m-}do\tsc{.ipfv-hab.pst}\\
	\glt	\sqt{Grandfather used to work, [as a builder, as \ldots]}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎The bandits went upwards, singing anasheed in Arabic}
	\gll	c'il	ag-ur	lak [\ldots]	turk-m-a-l	b-uč'-unne	hetːi	ʡaˁrab-la	ʁaj-li		illallah	b-ik'-ul\\

	\glt	\sqt{(‎The bandits) went upwards [\ldots], singing a nasheed in Arabic, \dqt{Illallah}}

	\ex	\label{ex:They were apparently praying}
	\gll	debʁul-m-a-l	b-irq'-ul	b-už-ib-le=de\\
		prayer\tsc{-pl-obl-erg}	\tsc{hpl-}do\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	\tsc{hpl-}be\tsc{-pret-cvb=pst}\\
	\glt	\sqt{They were apparently praying.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎Saying I drive that, here, he was writing letters to us}
	\gll	``hel	b-ik-ul=da,''	∅-ik'-ul,	``heštːu,''		nišːi-j	kaʁur-t-a-l	luk'-unne\\
		that	\tsc{n-}lead\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=1}	\tsc{m-}say\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	here	\tsc{1pl-dat}	letter\tsc{-pl-obl-erg}	write\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎Saying \dqt{I drive that, here}, he was writing letters to us.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎They were dancing surprisingly beautifully, not like our (women), (and they were) also elderly women}
	\gll	ʡaˁžib	qːuʁa	ʡaˁjur-t-a-l	b-irq'-ul=de,	nišːa-la-te	daˁʡle	akːʷ-ar,	χːula	xːun-re=ra\\

	\glt	\sqt{‎They were dancing surprisingly beautifully, not like our (women), also the elderly women.}
\end{exe}

By contrast, the P argument in the \isi{ergative} construction can have a definite interpretation, referring to specific object. Thus, compare \refex{ex:He tells the story} in which the subject referent is telling a specific story\footnote{This is clear from the context of the example. Without a context the same sentence could also be translated as `He tells a story.'} to \refex{ex:He tells many stories}, which refers to the action of storytelling without specifying the stories further, but could rather be a characterization of the person as a story-teller.\footnote{The two verb in the examples represent two distinct lexemes, which are partially in complementary distribution because of their aspectual properties. The verb in \refex{ex:He tells many stories} is used as the imperfective counterpart of the verb \textit{b-urs-ij}, which occurs in \refex{ex:He tells the story}. It is morphologically defective because it can only be inflected for the \isi{imperfective converb} and the \isi{modal participle}, whereas \textit{b-urs-ij} can be inflected for all verb forms and is aspectually neuter. The exact relationship between the two verbs requires further investigation.} 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\isi{ergative} construction \label{ex:He tells the story} \\
	\gll	hež-i-l	χabar	b-urs-ul	ca-b\\

\subsection{Causativization}\label{sec:Causativization}
\largerpage

Sanzhi has a very productive derivational process for the formation of causativized predicates by means of the suffix \tit{-aq}. The derived causativized verbs behave like any other underived verbs, i.e., there are no differences in the range of verbal forms and constructions in which they may appear. The suffixation of \tit{-aq} does not have any impact on the aspectual properties of the verb, such that the differences between imperfective verbs and perfective verbs are preserved. In addition, there are other formal means for making \is{causative construction}causative constructions such as auxiliary change.

Causative constructions are very widespread among the East Caucasian languages, though not all languages have dedicated derivational suffixes. In Sanzhi Dargwa, causativization normally applies only once to the verbal stem, but in elicitation it can also be added twice. When it is added to the verb, usually the \isi{number} of arguments of the verb is augmented by one. This means that a \isi{monovalent verb} becomes bivalent whereby S changes to P and a second argument, the \isi{ergative} A in the role of the causer is introduced. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:This mill spins around} intransitive \\
	\gll	heχ	urχːab	lus	b-ik'-u\\
		\tsc{dem.down}	mill	around	\tsc{n-}move\tsc{.ipfv-prs.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{This mill spins around.} (E)


	\ex	\label{ex:This makes the mill spin around} intransitive \\
	\gll	heχ-i-l	heχ	urχːab	lus	b-ik'-aq-u\\
		\tsc{dem.down}\tsc{-obl-erg}	\tsc{dem.down}	mill	around	\tsc{n-}move\tsc{.ipfv-caus-prs.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{This makes the mill spin around.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎Something like this grows in Sanzhi} transitive \\
	\gll	Sanži-b	b-ik'-u=w	ij=ʁuna?\\
		Sanzhi\tsc{-n}	\tsc{n-}grow\tsc{.ipfv-prs.3=q}	this\tsc{=eq}\\
	\glt	\sqt{Does something like this grows in Sanzhi?}
	
	\ex	\label{ex:‎Marijam was growing cucumbers} transitive \\
	\gll	Marijam-li	χijal-te	d-ač'-aq-ib\\
		Marijam\tsc{-erg}	cucumber\tsc{-pl}	\tsc{npl-}grow\tsc{.pfv-caus-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎Marijam was growing cucumbers.} (E)
\end{exe}

Similarly, after causativization the S argument of bivalent extended intransitive predicates \refex{ex:The people turned into stones2} becomes P and thus does not change its case marking, the second argument also remains unchanged and a third argument, the causer in the form of an \isi{ergative} A is added \refex{ex:‎‎‎Irbihin turned the khinkal that was boiling in the pot into frogs}. 

\begin{exe}

	\ex	\label{ex:The people turned into stones2} extended intransitive\\
	\gll	χalq'	qːarq-ne	arž-i\\
		people	stone\tsc{-pl}	go\tsc{.ipfv-hab.pst.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{The people turned into stones.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎Irbihin turned the khinkal that was boiling in the pot into frogs} extended transitive\\
	\gll	hek'	ħaˁšukː-a-d	rurčː-an	χːink'-e	ʡaˁt'-ne	arž-aq-i	heχ	Irbihin-ni\\
		\tsc{dem.up}	pot\tsc{-loc-npl}	boil\tsc{-ptcp}	khinkal\tsc{-pl}	frog\tsc{-pl}	go\tsc{.ipfv-caus-hab.pst.3}	\tsc{dem.down}	Irbihin\tsc{-erg}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎Irbihin turned the khinkal that was boiling in the pot into frogs.} (E)
\end{exe}

Bivalent transitive predicates become trivalent extended transitive predicates when they are causativized, and the former As become Gs whereas Ps are unaffected \refex{ex:Madina, mother, and the porridge}. The G argument, that is, the causee, must be marked with the \tsc{in}-lative case. This case is frequently used in valency patterns of various predicates for semantic roles such as addressee, \isi{goal} or beneficiary, which explains its use in \is{causative construction}causative constructions. The causee has semantic properties close to these roles since it is the argument, at which the action is directed and that might profit from it. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Madina, mother, and the porridge}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\label{ex:Madina was eating porridge} transitive \\
		\gll	Madina-l	kaš	b-uk-unne=de\\
			Madina\tsc{-erg}	porridge	\tsc{n-}eat\tsc{.ipfv-icvb=pst}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Madina was eating porridge.} (E)

		\ex	\label{ex:Mother made Madina eat porridge} extended transitive \\
		\gll	aba-l	Madina-cːe	kaš	b-erk-aq-un\\
			mother\tsc{-erg}	Madina\tsc{-in}	porridge	\tsc{n-}eat\tsc{.pfv-caus-pret}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Mother made Madina eat porridge.} (E)
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}




In the Sanzhi corpus, causativized \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs are rather rare. Sentences \refex{ex:‎‎If it is like this, I will also make him record that other (story)} and \refex{ex:to make the boys drink} show two instances. Many corpus examples of \is{causative construction}causative constructions have intransitive base verbs such as \refex{ex:This makes the mill spin around} and \refex{ex:‎Marijam was growing cucumbers} above, but causativized \is{affective verb}affective verbs also occur frequently \refex{ex:(that) doctor Mahammad makes the people find (him)}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎If it is like this, I will also make him record that other (story)}
	\gll	heχ	cara	zapisat	b-irq'-aq-an=da	du-l	il-i-cːe\\
		\tsc{dem.down}	other	record	\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.ipfv-caus-ptcp=1}	\tsc{1sg-erg} that\tsc{-obl-in}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎If it is like this, I will also make him record that other (story).}

	\ex	\label{ex:to make the boys drink}
	\gll	heχ-tːi	durħ-n-a-cːe	b-erčː-aq-araj\\
		\tsc{dem.down}\tsc{-pl}	boy\tsc{-pl-obl-in}	\tsc{n-}drink\tsc{.pfv-caus-subj.3}\\
	\glt	\sqt{to make the boys drink}
\end{exe}

With bivalent \isi{experiential} predicates there are two possibilities: either one argument is added or the \isi{number} of arguments is preserved. In the first case, the \isi{experiencer} (the former A) becomes G without changing its case marking, but an additional A is added to the clause because the derived verb is trivalent \refex{ex:Patima showed Madina a new dress@59b}. 

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Madina, Patima, and the dress@59}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\label{ex:Madina saw a new dress@59a}
		\gll	Madina-j	jangi	kːurtːi	či-b-až-ib\\
			Madina\tsc{-dat}	new	dress	\tsc{spr-n-}see\tsc{.pfv-pret}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Madina saw a new dress.} (E)

		\ex	\label{ex:Patima showed Madina a new dress@59b}
		\gll	Pat'ima-l	Madina-j	jangi	kːurtːi	či-b-iž-aq-ib\\
			Patima\tsc{-erg}	Madina\tsc{-dat}	new	dress	\tsc{spr-n-}see\tsc{.ipfv-caus-pret}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Patima showed Madina a new dress.} (E)
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The same option is available for the \isi{causative} of \sqt{know}, which translates as \sqt{tell, inform, make know} \refex{ex:‎He thanked the sun}. It is also possible for the \isi{experiencer} argument to change its case marking from \isi{dative} to \tsc{in}-lative because the latter case is regularly used for addressees with verbs of speech, but also for causees of causativized transitive and extended \is{transitive verb}transitive verbs \refex{ex:Allah, tell me what happened}, \refex{ex:(that) doctor Mahammad makes the people find (him)}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎He thanked the sun}
	\gll	il-i-l	bari-li-j	barkalla	b-aχ-aq-ur\\
		that\tsc{-obl-erg}	sun\tsc{-obl-dat}	thanks	\tsc{n-}know\tsc{.pfv-caus-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎He thanked the sun.}

	\ex	\label{ex:Allah, tell me what happened}
	\gll	[ce	ag-ur=el],	Allah,	b-aχ-aq-a=kːʷa	di-cːe!\\
		what	go\tsc{.pfv-pret=indq}	Allah	\tsc{n-}know\tsc{.pfv-caus-imp=prt}	\tsc{1sg-in}\\
	\glt	\sqt{Allah, tell me what happened.}

	\ex	\label{ex:(that) doctor Mahammad makes the people find (him)}
	\gll	tuχtur	Maˁħaˁmmad-li	χalq'-li-cːe	w-arčː-aq-ij\\
		doctor	Mahammad\tsc{-erg}	people\tsc{-obl-in}	\tsc{m-}find\tsc{.pfv-caus-inf}\\
	\glt	\sqt{(that) doctor Mahammad makes the people find (him)}
\end{exe}

The second option for \is{affective verb}affective verbs is not to have any change in the argument structure of the predicate such that both grammatical relations (A and P) as well as semantic roles remain unaltered. Only the semantics of the predicate slightly changes when the verb is causativized \refexrange{ex:Mother likes/wants her son@60a}{ex:Murad loved Madina@60b} and acquires a more agentive reading. This becomes especially obvious when the \isi{ergative} instead of the \isi{dative} is used to encode the \isi{experiencer} of a causativized affective predicate. Verbs that choose this strategy are \tit{b-ikː-} \sqt{want, like}, \tit{b- arkː-} (\tsc{pfv}) \sqt{find}, and \textit{han} \tit{d-irk-} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{remember} (>\tit{han d-irč-aq-}).

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Mother, son; Murad, Madina@60}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex	\label{ex:Mother likes/wants her son@60a}
		\gll	aba-j	durħuˁ	w-ikː-u\\
			mother\tsc{-dat}	boy	\tsc{m-}want\tsc{.ipfv-prs.3}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Mother likes/wants her son.} (E)

		\ex	\label{ex:Murad loved Madina@60b}
		\gll	Murad-li-j	Madina	r-ičː-aq-ib\\
			Murad\tsc{-obl-dat}	Madina	\tsc{f-}want\tsc{.ipfv-caus-pret}\\
		\glt	\sqt{Murad loved Madina.} (E)
	\end{xlist}

	\ex	\label{ex:My cousin loves official appointments very much}
	\gll	d-aq	ħaˁkim-dex	d-ičː-aq-u	di-la	ucːiq'ar-li-j\\
		\tsc{npl-}much	official\tsc{-nmlz}	\tsc{npl-}want\tsc{.ipfv-caus-prs.3}	\tsc{1sg-gen}	cousin-\tsc{obl-dat}\\
	\glt	\sqt{My cousin loves official appointments very much.}
\end{exe}

If trivalent predicates are causativized, then A becomes the causee with the appropriate case suffix (\tsc{in}-lative) and a new causer in the \isi{ergative} is added to the clause \refex{ex:Father made him show me the way@61}. Since the verb \tit{b-ikː-} (\tsc{pfv})\slash\tit{lukː-} (\tsc{ipfv}) \sqt{give} assigns not only the \isi{dative} case to the \isi{recipient}, but alternatively also the \tsc{in}-lative, it is possible to have two arguments with the same case marking in a clause with the causativized verb \sqt{give} \refex{ex:Father made him give me the book}. Due to the identical case marking such clauses are ambiguous.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:Father made him show me the way@61}
	\gll	atːa-l	it-i-cːe	dam	xːun	či-b-až-aq-aq-ib\\
		father\tsc{-erg}	that\tsc{-obl-in}	\tsc{1sg.dat}	way	\tsc{spr-n-}see\tsc{.pfv-caus-caus-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{Father made him show me the way.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:Father made him give me the book}
	\gll	atːa-l	di-cːe	it-i-cːe	kiniga	b-ičː-aq-ib\\
		father\tsc{-erg}	\tsc{1sg-in}	that\tsc{-obl-in}	book	\tsc{n-}give\tsc{.pfv-caus-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎Father made me give him the book.} OR \sqt{Father made him give me the book.} (E)
\end{exe}

In sum, if an additional argument is added by means of causativization, it is always a causer marked with the \isi{ergative}, independently of the \isi{valency class} of the base predicate. Because the causer takes the subject position, the original subject (S or A) is demoted into a non-subject position (S > P, A > G), taking over the highest free position on the hierarchy of grammatical relations. For S this is the \isi{direct object} position (P); for A this is the \isi{indirect object} position (G) since the \isi{direct object} position (P/T) is already occupied. It is never P or T that is affected when bivalent or trivalent predicates are causativized such that causativization can perhaps be taken as a weak indicator of an accusative pivot (see the discussion of \is{grammatical role}grammatical roles in \refsec{sec:Grammatical relations}).

Double causativization seems to be possible, as \refex{ex:Father made him show me the way@61} shows, and can lead to the addition of two arguments (i.e. the \isi{two-place verb} \sqt{see} becomes a four place verb). However, it can also be used for emphasis only such that the second causativization does not result in the addition of a second argument \refex{ex:Ali made the dogs fight UNCERTAIN INTERPRETATION}. In the corpus I found only one example of this \refex{ex:‎He hit her and (we) were made to fight, he says}. The precise properties of double \is{causative construction}causative constructions are hard to determine because speakers have divergent intuitions about the acceptability and meaning of elicited examples and the only corpus example \refex{ex:‎He hit her and (we) were made to fight, he says} is difficult to understand and to judge, even within its context.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:The dogs fought}
	\gll	χːu-de d-iħ-ib\\
		dog\tsc{-pl}	\tsc{npl-}wrestle\tsc{.pfv-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{The dogs fought.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:Ali made the dogs fight}
	\gll	ʡaˁli-l χːu-de d-iħ-aˁq-ib\\
		Ali\tsc{-erg} dog\tsc{-pl}	\tsc{npl-}wrestle\tsc{.pfv-caus-pret}\\
	\glt	\sqt{Ali made the dogs fight.} (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:Ali made the dogs fight UNCERTAIN INTERPRETATION}

	\glt	\sqt{Ali made the dogs fight.}  (E)

	\ex	\label{ex:‎He hit her and (we) were made to fight, he says}
	\gll	hek'-i-l	b-aˁq-ib-le,	d-iħ-aˁq-aˁq-ib=da	∅-ik'-ul\\
		\tsc{dem.up}\tsc{-obl-erg}	\tsc{n-}strike\tsc{.pfv-pret-cvb}	\tsc{1/2pl-}wrestle\tsc{.pfv-caus-caus-pret=1}	\tsc{m-}say\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎He hit her, and ``(we) were made to fight'', he says.}
\end{exe}

The meaning of \is{causative construction}causative constructions can be described as the expression of \dqt{a causal relation between two events, one of which is believed by the speaker to be caused by the other} \citep{Kulikov2011}. Depending on the semantics of the predicate and on the context, the meaning of the \isi{causative construction} can be close to force (\sqt{make do X}, \sqt{cause to X}), but it can also be \sqt{soft causation}, i.e., asking, requesting or begging \refex{ex:‎We will ask for telling the story}, or sometimes even quite idiosyncratic and unpredictable. Thus, the meaning of the causativized \isi{intransitive verb} \tit{b-ucː-} \sqt{work} is \sqt{support, sustain} \refex{ex:He feeds his family (he sustains his family working)} in addition to the expected \isi{causative} meaning of \sqt{make work}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex	\label{ex:‎We will ask for telling the story}
	\gll	χabar	b-urs-aq-an=da\\
		story	\tsc{n-}tell\tsc{-caus-ptcp=1}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎We will ask for a story to be told.}

	\ex	\label{ex:‎They are also for those who want to buy them}
	\gll	d-ikː-an-il-li-j	asː-aq-ij	iχ-tːi=ra	χe-d\\
		\tsc{npl-}want\tsc{.ipfv-ref-ptcp-obl-dat}	buy\tsc{.pfv-caus-inf} \tsc{dem.down}\tsc{-pl=add} exist.\tsc{down-npl}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎They are also for those who want to buy them.} (lit. \sqt{They are to make buy those who want them.})

	\ex	\label{ex:‎‎‎(they were) building, working for three days}
	\gll	b-irq'-ul	k'ʷel	ʡaˁbal	bar	b-ucː-ib-le\\
		\tsc{n-}do\tsc{.ipfv-icvb}	two	three	day	\tsc{hpl-}work\tsc{-pret-cvb}\\
	\glt	\sqt{‎‎‎(they were) building, working for three days}

	\ex	\label{ex:He feeds his family (he sustains his family working)}
	\gll	hel-i-l	cin-na	kulpat	b-ucː-aq-ul ca-b\\
		that\tsc{-obl-erg}	\tsc{refl.sg-gen}	family	\tsc{hpl-}work\tsc{-caus-icvb} \tsc{cop-hpl}\\
	\glt	\sqt{He feeds his family (he sustains his family working).} OR \sqt{He makes his family work.}
\end{exe}

Another way of forming \is{causative construction}causative constructions is by means of transitive \is{light verb}light verbs. This operation is applied with \is{compound verb}compound verbs that contain intransitive \is{light verb}light verbs (\refsec{sec:Formation of causative verbs}).
