\BackBody{Nyakyusa is an underdescribed Bantu language spoken by around 800.000 speakers in the Mbeya Region of Tanzania. This book provides a detailled description of the verb in this language. The topics covered include the complex morphophonological and morphological processes as well as verb-to-verb derivation, copula verbs and grammaticalized verbs of motion. The main body of the book consists of a detailed description of tense, aspect and modality constructions, which includes not only an in-depth discussion of their sentence level semantics, but also of their patterns of employment in discourse.

This is the second edition of a book originally published in 2017. Throughout the volume, typographical errors have been corrected, a few textual improvements have been implemented, the status of some references has been updated, and broken URL links have been repaired or removed. The overall content has not been changed.}
