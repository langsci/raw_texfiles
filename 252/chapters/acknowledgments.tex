The current volume profited from the insights of many, first and foremost of course from the contributing authors. Importantly, the articles included herein have also undergone a thorough peer-review process in two steps, first, for the abstracts submitted to the conference, second for the manuscripts submitted to the volume. All manuscripts have subsequently been revised by the authors based on input received from two or more reviewers for each manuscript. We would thus like to express our gratitude to the following colleagues for reviewing for the conference or the resulting volume, and in some cases for both occasions: Nadine Bade, Sigrid Beck, Nora Boneh, Marco Coniglio, Ashwini Deo, Regine Eckardt, Matthias Eitelmann, Kai von Fintel, Chiara Gianollo, Dag Haug, Agnes Jäger, Łukasz Jędrzejowski, Martin Kopf-Giammanco, Krzyztof Migdalski, Gerhard Schade, Alexandra Simonenko, Augustin Speyer, Igor Yanovich, and Hedde Zeijlstra. 

After the submission of the second and revised version of her paper and before the publication of the volume, our appreciated colleague and contributor Edit Doron sadly passed away. We thank Malka Rappaport-Hovav for assisting us with the final editorial steps of the corresponding first chapter of this volume. 

Finally, we wish to thank the series editors Philippa Cook and Anke Holler for their advice as well as Felix Kopecky and Sebastian Nordhoff for their technical support in publishing the book with Language Science Press.
