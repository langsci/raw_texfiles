\newcommand{\BackBody}{In this book, I propose a grammar fragment which accounts for the main properties of two elliptical constructions (`lacking' for the verbal head) called gapping (1) and verbless relative adjuncts (therefore, \textsc{vra}) (2) respectively.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Jean aime les pommes [et Marie les bananes]. `Jean likes apples and Maria bananas' 
\item Plusieurs personnes sont venues cette semaine, [dont Marie (hier)]. `Several people have come this week, among which Marie yesterday'
\end{enumerate}
We mainly argue for the fact that elliptical clauses in gapping and \textsc{vra} constructions don’t behave as regular verbal clauses. Their syntactic and semantic properties don’t provide evidence for deriving this kind of elliptical clause from a complete clause. An analysis in terms of syntactic reconstruction of the missing material is therefore inadequate. Thus, the elliptical clause in both constructions (gapping and \textsc{vra}) has a specific syntactic behaviour and must be assigned an independent status in the grammar, more precisely the status of a fragmentary clause, that is a syntactic unit having a propositional content of message type, but an incomplete syntax. This dissertation gives new arguments in favor of a semantic reconstruction with parallelism constraints, cf. Ginzburg \& Sag~(2000), Culicover \& Jackendoff~(2005).}
