\addchap{Acknowledgments}

The research on which the first two chapters of this volume are based would not have been possible without the support of NSF Grants Nos. GS-39748 and S0C75-14481, for which grateful acknowledgment is hereby made. I am also indebted to the University of \isi{Hawaii} for granting me an additional leave of absence which, together with my regular sabbatical leave, gave me two years in which to work out the theory presented here.

The ideas contained in this volume have been discussed, in person and in correspondence, with many colleagues; while it is in a sense in\-vidious to pick out names, Paul Chapin, Talmy Giv√≥n, Tom Markey, and Dan Slobin have been among the most long-suffering listeners. I am also grateful to Frank Byrne, Chris Corne, Greg Lee, and Dennis Pres\-ton for reading parts of the manuscript. Needless to say, I alone remain responsible for whatever errors and omissions may still be present.
