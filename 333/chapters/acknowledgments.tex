We are thankful to a number of people who helped us realize this project. Above all, we thank the individual authors who contributed their research, time, and professionalism to the present volume on alternative language assessments. We also appreciate the continuous support offered by our series editors, Susana Eisenchlas and Andrea Schalley.  Some of the production of the present volume took place in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, making things more challenging for authors and reviewers. Patience, resilience and commitment prevailed and we are indebted to wonderful colleagues who participated in this project.
