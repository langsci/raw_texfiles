The contributors in this volume are scholars from different disciplines and contexts in Higher Education. They have created and proposed multiple lower-stakes assignments and accommodated learning by being flexible and open without assuming that learners know how to do specific tasks already. Each chapter provides different examples on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) assessment practices based on observation, examination and integrative notions of diverse language scenarios.\medskip
