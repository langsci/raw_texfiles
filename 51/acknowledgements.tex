\addchap{Acknowledgements}

Much of the research presented in this book could not have been completed without the use of systems and data that were developed by various members of the wonderful teams of both the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the Sony CSL Laboratory in Paris.

I would like to thank Michael Spranger and Martin Loetzsch for their tremendous effort in recording data using the Sony humanoid robots. I am also much obliged to Joachim De Beule, Nicolas Neubauer, Pieter Wellens and Remi van Trijp for the development of FCG, and to Wouter Van den Broeck, Simon Pauw, Michael Spranger and Martin Loetzsch for the development of IRL. Some of the experiments on basic colour systems are also indebted to critical scientific input by Tony Belpaeme. 

And, of course, it is hard to imagine any of this work to materialise without the continuous effort and scientific vision of Luc Steels, the director of both labs.

The research reported in this book has been financially supported by a doctoral grant of the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders (IWT-Vlaanderen).
