\title{Multiword expressions in lexical resources}
\subtitle{Linguistic, lexicographic, and computational perspectives}
\BackBody{This volume contains chapters that paint the current landscape of the multiword expressions (MWE) representation in lexical resources, in view of their robust identification and computational processing. Both large-size general lexica and smaller MWE-centred ones are included, with special focus on the representation decisions and mechanisms that facilitate their usage in Natural Language Processing tasks. The presentations go beyond the morpho-syntactic description of MWEs, into their semantics.

One challenge in representing MWEs in lexical resources is ensuring that the variability along with extra features required by the different types of MWEs can be captured efficiently. In this respect, recommendations for representing MWEs in mono- and multilingual computational lexicons have been proposed; these focus mainly on the syntactic and semantic properties of support verbs and noun compounds and their proper encoding thereof.}
