	the Caucasus (Daghestanian, Tsakhur, Chechen), the Middle East (Persian

  month = {apr},
  abstract = {Complex predicates are multipredicational, but monoclausal structures.
	They have proven problematic for linguistic theory, particularly
	for proposed distinctions between the lexicon, morphology, and syntax.
	This volume focuses on the mapping from morphosyntactic structures
	to event structure, and in particular, the constraints on possible
	mappings. The volume showcases the 'coverb construction' a complex
	predicate construction which, though widespread, has received little
	attention in the literature. The coverb construction contrasts with
	more familiar serial verb constructions. The coverb construction
	generally maps only to event structures like those of monomorphemic
	verbs, whereas serial verb constructions map to a range of event
	structures differing from those of monomorphemic verbs. The volume
	coverage is truly cross-linguistic, including languages from Australia,
	Papua New Guinea, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, East Africa
	and North America. The volume establishes a new arena of research
	in event structure, syntax, and cross-linguistic typology.},

	arena; as Islamic forces re-evaluate and redesign their strategies
	in society; and as new dynamics with United States, China, Russia,
	India and Central Asian states are being forged. The papers in this
	volume, on the one hand, provide diverging and competing visions
	of Pakistan and on the other, reveal how traditional social order
	and culture are adapting to forces of modernization and globalization.
	It analyzes the issues of national identity and state formation,
	Islamization, rise of Jihadi groups and their relationship with the
	military; de-institutionalization of political parties; erosion of
	liberal values and challenges of constructing democracy, imperatives
	of state security and globalization.The book ventures to explain
	the disabilities, constraints, and missed opportunities and provides
	a new framework of dialogue and debate on the study of Pakistan.
	How Pakistan is responding to these domestic and global challenges
	need to be evaluated by focusing on the capacity and performance
	of the state and society.},

	SOV to SVO. Most SVO languages are clustered in large linguistic
	areas, so it may be that diffusion is largely responsible for the
	posited growth in SVO languages. Nichols (1992) interprets the global
	distribution of certain morphosyntactic features as reflecting large-scale
	drift, and the distribution of ergativity is suggestive of such a
	widespread change. But apart from these putative large-scale changes,
	there is evidence of an emerging global trend that results from the
	political dominance of European, international languages such as
	English. It is well known that this dominance has led to loss of
	diversity and overrepresentation of the type represented by these

	are having on the grammar of various other languages. We may be seeing

	in society; and as new dynamics with United States, China, Russia,

	of Pakistan and on the other, reveal how traditional social order
	and culture are adapting to forces of modernization and globalization.
	It analyzes the issues of national identity and state formation,
	Islamization, rise of Jihadi groups and their relationship with the
	military; de-institutionalization of political parties; erosion of
	liberal values and challenges of constructing democracy, imperatives
	of state security and globalization.The book ventures to explain

	and affixes, and the adequacy of competing models of word structure.In
	addition, the role of phonological factors in shaping complex words
	is discussed.Evidence for particular positions defended in this volume
	is taken from a wide variety of languages.This volume is of interest
	to those working in theoretical, descriptive and historical linguistics,
	morphologists, phonologists, computational linguists, and psycholinguists.

	In this paper I survey the state of the field and describe current
	ideas on the origins and development of complex predicates. In particular,
	I show that the assumption of cline-like development from parataxis
	to affix (through serialisation, light verbs and auxiliation) is
	too simplistic. Finally, I review arguments in favor of and against
	views of light verbs as stable structures. German Obwohl Complex
	predicate-Konstruktionen, einschließlich Light verb- und Verbserialisierungsstrukturen,
	in vielen Sprachen der Welt zu finden sind, liegen bis heute nur
	wenige diachrone Arbeiten zu diesem Thema vor. Er werden deshalb
	hier der bisherige Forschungsstand sowie aktuell diskutierte Hypothesen
	bezüglich des Entstehens und der Entwicklung von Complex predicates
	zusammengefasst und diskutiert. Dabei erweist sich insbesondere die
	Annahme dass sich Complex predicates entlang eines Grammatikalisierungspfads
	von Parataxis zu Affix (per Serialisierung, Light verb und Auxiliarisierung)
	entwickeln als zu einfach. Abschließend werden Argumente für und

	orthography and of the inflectional and derivational morphology applied
	to all major word classes, with special attention to the complex
	morphology of verb formation and descriptions of the multiple pronominal
	systems. Notes on some of the prominent syntactic constructions are
	provided as a descriptive basis for learners of Pashto and for those
	interested in syntactic properties characteristic of South Asian
	languages. For the first time, the highly distinctive Middle dialects,
	including Waziri, receive attention next to the other major dialect
	groups. A formal grammar focusing on the morphology is an available

	generally maps only to event structures like those of monomorphemic

	structures differing from those of monomorphemic verbs. The volume
	coverage is truly cross-linguistic, including languages from Australia,
	Papua New Guinea, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, East Africa
	and North America. The volume establishes a new arena of research

	suppletion (as in go ∼ went). This is an unusual enterprise within
	typology, and it requires a 'canonical' approach. That is, I define
	the canonical or best instance, through a set of converging criteria,
	and use this point in theoretical space to locate the various occurring
	types. Thus the criteria establish the dimensions along which specific
	instances of suppletion are found, allowing me to calibrate examples
	out from the canonical. The criteria fall into two main areas, those
	internal to the lexeme and those external to it. Moreover, I find
	interactions with other morphological phenomena and discuss four
	of them: syncretism, periphrasis, overdifferentiation, and reduplication.
	These remarkable instances of suppletion, particularly when in interaction
	with other phenomena, extend the boundary of the notion 'possible
	word'. Besides laying out the possibilities for the specific phenomenon
	of suppletion, I show how a canonical approach allows progress in
	typology, even in the most challenging areas.},

	or cross-referencing on the verb, can be either (i) ergative, marking
	transitive subject [A] function, vs. absolutive, marking intransitive
	subject [S] and transitive object [O]; or (ii) nominative, marking
	A and S, vs. accusative, marking O function. Absolutive is always
	the unmarked term in an absolutive/ergative opposition. Nominative
	is most frequently the unmarked term in a nominative/accusative system,
	but there are some languages in which accusative is unmarked. A language
	whose morphology mixes accusative and ergative marking has the split
	determined by (a) the semantic content of verbs, (b) the semantic
	content of NP's, (c) aspect/tense choice, or (d) a combination of
	these. A, S, and O are universal semantic-syntactic primitives. A
	universal category of 'subject' can be defined as the set \{A,S\},
	and is valid only for the level of deep structure. Language-particular
	syntactic operations, such as coördination and subordination, work
	in terms of a (shallow-structure) 'pivot'; this is most often S/A,
	but can be wholly or partly S/O (languages of the latter type are
	said to be ergative at the syntactic level). A major function of
	antipassive or passive derivations is to place A or O NP's (respectively)
	in derived pivot function, S. Many languages which have some morphological
	ergativity are entirely accusative (S/A pivot) at the syntactic level.
	All languages that show syntactic ergativity have some morphological
	ergativity.},

	Shina varieties. An attempt is made at reconstructing some phonological
	and grammatical features of a common source speech, here named Proto-Dangari,
	and the order in which the present-day varieties may have split off.
	An important conclusion drawn is that Southern and Northern Palula
	probably are more distantly related than present-day similarities
	seem to indicate, the high degree of synchronic similarity instead
	being due to relatively recent convergence taking place in southern
	Chitral. It is hypothesized that the present speech communities are
	the result of two different westward routes of migration, one geographically
	linking Southern Palula (Ashreti) and Sawi with Chilas, the other
	linking Northern Palula (Biori) and Kalkoti with Tangir, both located

	Bilinguals, when faced with the tension of choosing among the systems

	tempted to reduce the overt representation of the "grammar of directing"
	to just one set of elements. Preference is given to the pragmatically

	modifiers is therefore not due to lack of equivalent functions in
	the indigenous language, nor is it due to the prestige effect that
	the integration of L2 items may have on the overall flavor of the
	discourse. Rather, I attribute synchronic variation in the speech
	of bilinguals to the cognitive pressure exerted on them to draw on
	the resources of the pragmatically dominant language for situative,
	gesture like discourse-regulating purposes, and the diachronic change

	processes. Examination of the phenomenon across a large number of
	geographically and genetically diverse languages indicates that,
	where syntax and morphology diverge, incorporation is a solidly morphological
	device that derives lexical items, not sentences. It is used for
	four different but related purposes; these fall into an implicational
	hierarchy which in turn suggests a path along which incorporation
	develops historically. Differences in its productivity from language
	to language show that this development may be arrested at any point-resulting
	either in the eventual disappearance of the process, or in its resurgence
	as a productive system of affixation.},

	considerable importance in cognitive and functional linguistics over
	the last couple of decades, namely 'prototypical transitivity'. It
	discusses what prototypical transitivity is, why it should exist,
	and how it should be defined, as well as how this definition can
	be employed in the analysis of a number of phenomena of language,
	such as case-marking, experiencer constructions, and so-called ambitransitives.
	Also discussed is how a prototype analysis relates to other approaches
	to transitivity, such as that based on markedness. The basic claim
	is that transitivity is iconic: a construction with two distinct,
	independent arguments is prototypically used to refer to an event
	with two distinct, independent participants. From this principle,
	a unified account of the properties typically associated with transitivity
	can be derived, and an explanation for why these properties tend
	to correlate across languages can be given.},
