	abstract = {"The semantics of grammar" presents a radically semantic approach to syntax and morphology. It offers a methodology which makes it possible to demonstrate, on an empirical basis, that syntax is neither "autonomous" nor "arbitrary," but that it follows from "semantics." It is shown that every grammatical construction encodes a certain semantic structure, which can be revealed and rigorously stated, so that the meanings encoded in grammar can be compared in a precise and illuminating way, within one language and across language boundaries. The author develops a semantic metalanguage based on lexical universals or near-universals (and, ultimately, on a system of universal semantic primitives), and shows that the same semantic metalanguage can be used for explicating lexical, grammatical and pragmatic aspects of language and thus offers a method for an integrated linguistic description based on semantic foundations. Analyzing data from a number of different languages (including English, Russian and Japanese) the author explores the notion of ethnosyntax and, via semantics, links syntax and morphology with culture. She attemps to demonstrate that the use of a semantic metalanguage based on lexical universals makes it possible to rephrase the Humboldt-Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in such a way that it can be tested and treated as a program for empirical research.},

While addressed primarily to linguists, the book deals with highly topical and controversial issues of central importance to several disciplines, including anthropology, psychology, and philosophy. - ;Conceptual primitives and semantic universals are the cornerstones of a semantic theory which Anna Wierzbicka has been developing for many years. Semantics: Primes and Universals is a major synthesis of her work, presenting a full and systematic exposition of that theory in a non-technical and readable way. It delineates a full set of universal concepts, as they have emerged from large-scale investigations across a wide range of languages undertaken by the author and her colleagues. On the basis of empirical cross-linguistic studies it vindicates the old notion of the 'psychic unity of mankind', while at the same time offering a framework for the rigorous description of different languages and cultures. - ;A major synthesis of Anna Wierzbicka's work -},

Already the number of simple verb roots can vary between only around twelve up to several thousand. There is, however, a small core of concepts that have a strong tendency to be lexicalized as verbs in all languages. Crosslinguistically, interesting patterns have been identified with respect to polysemy and the way in which elementary meanings are combined in simple roots. Syntactically, verbs are central in the clause via their argument structure. Languages also tend to have one or more valency-changing derivations marked on verbs. The major inflectional categories are agreement or reference tracking and tense, mood, and aspect.},

It also treats etymology and onomastics in some detail.The approach is data oriented throughout. Students are encouraged to confront data, to spot patterns and to construct their own accounts and they are encouraged to consider their own experience of English and other languages.},

She presents an analysis of grammatical descriptions of over 160 languages drawn from the language families of the world. She shows that some languages have a single copula, others several, and some none at all. In a series of statistical analyses she seeks to explain why by linking the distribution of copulas to variations in lexical categorization and syntactic structure. She concludes by advancing a comprehensive theory of copularization which she relates to language classification and to theories of language change, notably grammaticalization.},

As in the first edition, the theoretical discussion is eclectic and critical: its scope ranges from the ancient grammarians to the work of Chomsky and his followers, the disintegration of the classical Chomskyan scheme, and the renewed standing of morphology and historical linguistics in recent years. The examples are drawn from English and other European languages, both ancient and modern. The work will appeal to both specialists in particular languages--it contains much original material--and students of general linguistics. For this new edition much now obsolete discussion has been removed and replaced by discussion of current trends, and the further reading sections have been thoroughly updated.},

The contributions to this volume represent the next generation of studies in anaphora  defined broadly as those morpho-syntactic forms available to speakers for formulating reference  taking as their starting point the foundation of research done in the 1980s. These studies examine in detail, and with a richness of methods and theories, what patterns of anaphoric usage can reveal to us about cognition, social interaction, and language change.},

Gender distinction is often based on sex; sometimes this is only one criterion and the gender of nouns depends on other factors (thus "house" is masculine in Russian, feminine in French and neuter in Tamil). On occasion there are equivalent distinctions such as human/non-human, animate/inanimate, where sex is irrelevant.},

This study focuses on the use and meaning of grammatical markers of tense, aspect, and modality and identifies a universal set of grammatical categories. The authors demonstrate that the semantic content of these categories evolves gradually and that this process of evolution is strikingly similar across unrelated languages.  Through a survey of seventy-six languages in twenty-five different phyla, the authors show that the same paths of change occur universally and that movement along these paths is in one direction only. This analysis reveals that lexical substance evolves into grammatical substance through various mechanisms of change, such as metaphorical extension and the conventionalization of implicature. Grammaticization is always accompanied by an increase in frequency of the grammatical marker, providing clear evidence that language use is a major factor in the evolution of synchronic language states.  The Evolution of Grammar has important implications for the development of language and for the study of cognitive processes in general.},

	abstract = {On the basis of a cross-linguistic study of over 250 languages, this book brings to light several fascinating characteristics of pronouns. It argues that these words do not form a single category, but rather two different categories called 'personal pronouns' and 'proforms'. It points out several differences between the two, such as the occurrence of a dual structure among proforms but not among personal pronouns. These differences are shown to derive from the distinct functions that thetwo categories have to perform in language. The book also shows that the so-called interrogative pronouns of familiar languages do not actually have interrogation as their meaning. One can only assign the meaning of indefiniteness to them. Further, the notion of indefiniteness that can be associated with these and other pronouns is quite different from the one that can be associated with noun phrases. Other interesting aspects of this book include the postulation of certain typological distinctions like 'two-person' and 'three-person' languages and 'free-pronoun' and 'bound-pronoun' languages.},

	abstract = {Members of a functional category that I tentatively call "utterance modifiers" are the most vulnerable items to contact-related linguistic change in grammar. Utterance modifiers regulate linguistic-mental processing activities that can be attributed to a "grammar of directing" Bilinguals, when faced with the tension of choosing among the systems at their disposal in what is a highly automaticized operation, are tempted to reduce the overt representation of the "grammar of directing" to just one set of elements. Preference is given to the pragmatically dominant language. Contact-related change in the area of utterance modifiers is therefore not due to lack of equivalent functions in the indigenous language, nor is it due to the prestige effect that the integration of L2 items may have on the overall flavor of the discourse. Rather, I attribute synchronic variation in the speech of bilinguals to the cognitive pressure exerted on them to draw on the resources of the pragmatically dominant language for situative, gesture like discourse-regulating purposes, and the diachronic change that arises from such variation to the establishment of a permanent licensing for speakers to do so.},

It shows students in a step-by-step fashion how to analyze the syntax and morphology of any language, by clearly describing the basic methods and techniques, and providing almost 100 practical exercises based on data from a rich variety of the world's languages. Written in an engaging style and complete with a comprehensive glossary, Exploring Language Structure explains linguistic concepts by using clear analogies from everyday life. It introduces a range of essential topics in syntax and morphology, such as rules, categories, word classes, grammatical relations, multi-clause constructions and typology. Providing a solid foundation in morphology and syntax, this is the perfect introductory text for beginning students, and will fully prepare them for more advanced courses in linguistic analysis.},

	abstract = {Morphological marking, whether realized by nominal case inflections or cross-referencing on the verb, can be either (i) ergative, marking transitive subject [A] function, vs. absolutive, marking intransitive subject [S] and transitive object [O]; or (ii) nominative, marking A and S, vs. accusative, marking O function. Absolutive is always the unmarked term in an absolutive/ergative opposition. Nominative is most frequently the unmarked term in a nominative/accusative system, but there are some languages in which accusative is unmarked. A language whose morphology mixes accusative and ergative marking has the split determined by (a) the semantic content of verbs, (b) the semantic content of NP's, (c) aspect/tense choice, or (d) a combination of these. A, S, and O are universal semantic-syntactic primitives. A universal category of 'subject' can be defined as the set \{A,S\}, and is valid only for the level of deep structure. Language-particular syntactic operations, such as coördination and subordination, work in terms of a (shallow-structure) 'pivot'; this is most often S/A, but can be wholly or partly S/O (languages of the latter type are said to be ergative at the syntactic level). A major function of antipassive or passive derivations is to place A or O NP's (respectively) in derived pivot function, S. Many languages which have some morphological ergativity are entirely accusative (S/A pivot) at the syntactic level. All languages that show syntactic ergativity have some morphological ergativity.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-926402-5},
	abstract = {Patrick Farrell explains how grammatical relations are characterized in modern theories of grammar. He describes the historical development and conceptual precedents of competing theories and, ranging across a wide variety of languages, considers what their merits and limitations are in different contexts. He examines their conceptions of relations such as subject, object, indirect object, agent, patient, and actor, and their accounts of such syntactic phenomena as ergativity, split intransitivity, voice alternations, and case marking. Professor Farrell compares mainstream generative-transformational approaches with both formalist and functionalist alternative approaches, revealing points of convergence and divergence. He identifies and discusses problems and issues of continuing concern and considers how these might be resolved. This is an ideal introduction for graduate students and will be a valuable reference for theoretical linguists of all persuasions.

Its volumes are accessible, critical, and up-to-date. Individually and collectively they reveal the value of the field's intellectual history and theoretical diversity. The books provide graduate students of syntax, morphology and related aspects of semantics with a vital source of information and reference, and are designed for use in graduate courses. They give the context by which specialist articles can be fully understood. They provide useful background reading for advanced undergraduates researching a specific area. by Patrick Farrell by Andrew Carnie by Gisa Rauh by Daniel Everett by Sharon Inkelas by Stephen Weschler by Jean-Pierre Koenig by Nomi Erteschik-Shir by Anna Siewierska by Olga Fischer by Brian Roark and Richard Sproat by Shanley Allen and Heike Behrens},

	abstract = {The twentieth century was witness to two major poetic personalities on the Indian literary scene, both of whom were inspired by the message of the Qur'an: Khwaja Alfat Husayn Hali (d. 1914) and Muhammad Iqbal (d. 1938). In his Musaddas, Hali versified the rise and fall of Islamic civilisation, and through his poetry he sought to inculcate the teachings of the Qur'an in the hearts of the Indian people. As for Iqbal, he presented his Islamic philosophy through the medium of Urdu poetry, referencing Qur'anic stories, verses, and teachings in works such as Baange-e-Dara and Baal-e-Jibrail. This article seeks to analyse the Qur'anic imagery that features extensively in Hali's and Iqbal's poetic works. The Musaddas, for example, speaks of the Muslim confraternity enshrined in the Qur'anic verse, You were enemies of each other but Allah aroused a sense of fraternity in your heart and you became brothers (Q. 3:103). Similarly, Iqbal's Shikwah and Jawāb-e-Shikwah are full of Qur'anic similes, metaphors, and images, as well as references to various prophets, including Moses, Abraham, and Muḥammad. Thus, Iqbal enlists the verse God is the Light of the heavens and the earth (Q. 24:35), for example, to show that man attains enlightenment because of the Light of God which is cast upon each and every object in the universe.},

The CASL Pashto grammar originates from extensive use of both primary and secondary materials. It attends to features of both spoken and written forms of Pashto and exemplifies the latter generously with naturally-occurring sentences. Detailed descriptions are provided of the phonology and orthography and of the inflectional and derivational morphology applied to all major word classes, with special attention to the complex morphology of verb formation and descriptions of the multiple pronominal systems. Notes on some of the prominent syntactic constructions are provided as a descriptive basis for learners of Pashto and for those interested in syntactic properties characteristic of South Asian languages. For the first time, the highly distinctive Middle dialects, including Waziri, receive attention next to the other major dialect groups. A formal grammar focusing on the morphology is an available companion work.},

	abstract = {A natural assumption in typology is that surveys taken at different periods of history would produce much the same profile. However, there are a number of hypotheses that posit global trends. Givón (1979), for instance, posits a long-term unidirectional change from SOV to SVO. Most SVO languages are clustered in large linguistic areas, so it may be that diffusion is largely responsible for the posited growth in SVO languages. Nichols (1992) interprets the global distribution of certain morphosyntactic features as reflecting large-scale drift, and the distribution of ergativity is suggestive of such a widespread change. But apart from these putative large-scale changes, there is evidence of an emerging global trend that results from the political dominance of European, international languages such as English. It is well known that this dominance has led to loss of diversity and overrepresentation of the type represented by these languages. Not so well known is the effect international languages are having on the grammar of various other languages. We may be seeing the emergence of a global linguistic area.},

It is argued, however, that the contradiction can be resolved in the present case, where change has been limited to large-scale lexical transfer as part of a general process of language-switching, the overall semantic scheme remaining the same. As with a number of similar theoretical treatments the article locates specific kinship terminologies and their changes in a historical framework.},

Moreover, while adverbial clauses are marked by an adverbial subordinator, relative clauses include a gap or (pro)noun(disregardinginternallyheadedrelativeclauses)thatiscoreferentialwiththe headnoun,i.e.thenounthattheymodify(Lehmann1984).6 5Since the semantic relationship between main and complement clauses is primarily defined by the meaningofthecomplement-takingpredicate(CTP)inthemainclause,complementizersusuallyhavelittle semanticcontentandcanthereforeoftenbeomitted. 6Notethatrelativeclausesmayalsoincludearelativemarkerthat,unlikethegaporrelative(pro)noun, is not co-indexed with the head noun.

	abstract = {This paper reports on the results of a detailed empirical study of word order correlations, based on a sample of 625 languages. The primary result is a determination of exactly what pairs of elements correlate in order with the verb and object. Some pairs of elements that have been claimed to correlate in order with the verb and object do not in fact exhibit any correlation. I argue against the Head-Dependent Theory (HDT), according to which the correlations reflect a tendency towards consistent ordering of heads and dependents. I offer an alternative account, the Branching Direction Theory (BDT), based on consistent ordering of phrasal and nonphrasal elements. According to the BDT, the word order correlations reflect a tendency for languages to be consistently right-branching or consistently left-branching.},

	abstract = {A mentored, learner-directed approach is a very effective strategy to enhance local capacity-building initiatives, particularly in cross-cultural, non-western environments. The focus of this research project was to determine what factors are critical and how trainers can facilitate such an approach in an appropriate manner that can empower people, and ensure the community-based organizations, which they represent, are successful and sustainable. While many studies on both learner-directed methodologies and mentoring have been carried out, most have been carried out in western contexts and rarely are they combined. In spite of that fact, the importance of a learner-directed approach facilitated within the context of a mentoring relationship cannot be overstated. The educational systems in non-western contexts, like Pakistan, builds high levels of dependency between students and teachers, which allows teachers to have manipulative influence over learners and limits their ability to achieve their full potential. This controlling factor can best be addressed and reversed within the context of a mentoring relationship in which the mentor uses a variety of training processes to transition the protégé from a state of "bound dependency" to "empowered interdependency"-from a mindset of passive learning in a classroom to that of an active lifelong learner. The results of this study demonstrate how trainers with a learner-directed mindset are better able to help heavily dependent learners grow and become competent, interdependent learners, necessary for fostering indigenous vision and enhancing work performance. A key objective in this study was to develop a model that not only helps learners gain new knowledge, skills and attitudes, but, more importantly, helps them learn how to learn. The concepts of transformational development, capacity building, experiential learning, learner-direction, mentoring, enculturation and acculturation are some of the key terms that are explored in-depth. Also because the capacity-building initiative, the Forum for Language Initiatives (or FLI), is central to this study and is located in Pakistan, considerable research on the Pakistan educational system was carried out and is presented here. The methodology used in this study is qualitative rather than quantitative. I conducted several interviews, documented my observations and results, and gathered various evaluations. A grounded theoretical approach was used to analyze these data. I make a number of assumptions in this work--one being that trainers and trainees often approach learning activities unaware of their own assumptions and expectations which directly impact the learning process, sometimes negatively, sometimes positively. The analysis of these data produces a working theory that answers my primary research question,},

Some of the central issues include the subject properties of noun phrases with ergative, dative, accusative and genitive case, case assignment and checking, anaphor-antecedent coreference, the nature of predicates with NNSs, whether they.},

	abstract = {The two Ladakhi dialect groups: Kenhat (Upper Ladakh) and Shamskat (Lower Ladakh) behave differently with respect to case marking variation. The Kenhat dialects are more sensitive to downgrading on the transitivity scale and allow more pragmatically conditioned variation between ergative and absolutive marking of agents. The more transitive a verb is, the more likely the 'subject' is to receive an ergative marker and vice versa. Pragmatic alternations occur mainly in the middle field, and are less likely to occur on the highest or lowest level. Several other Tibetan varieties have reduced case marking to a minimum. Depending on how severely case marking is reduced, there may be different solutions to the problems of elicitation and of creating an appropriate lexical entry. In this contribution, I will mainly focus on that type of varieties where case marking is (still) quite robust, and will exemplify this type with the dialect of Gya-Miru of the Kenhat group.},

Therefore, methodological key words of this book are areal typology and linguistic area. The issues addressed cover such diverse aspects of language structure and change as verb morphology, relative clause formation, Noun Phrase determination, demonstrative systems, possessive markers in Noun Phrases, conjunctive, disjunctive and adversative constructions, non-canonical object marking, impersonal constructions, reduplication and early translations of the Gospels. These topics are discussed particularly in relation to Romance, Germanic, Celtic and Semitic languages, both modern and ancient.

Contributions focus on four central topics: firstly, the question of the locus of variation, whether the attested variation may plausibly be understood in parametric terms and, if so, what form such parameters might take; secondly, the fate of one of the most prominent early parameters, the Null Subject Parameter; thirdly, the matter of parametric clusters more generally; and finally, acquisition issues.},

In this paper I survey the state of the field and describe current ideas on the origins and development of complex predicates. In particular, I show that the assumption of cline-like development from parataxis to affix (through serialisation, light verbs and auxiliation) is too simplistic. Finally, I review arguments in favor of and against views of light verbs as stable structures. German Obwohl Complex predicate-Konstruktionen, einschließlich Light verb- und Verbserialisierungsstrukturen, in vielen Sprachen der Welt zu finden sind, liegen bis heute nur wenige diachrone Arbeiten zu diesem Thema vor. Er werden deshalb hier der bisherige Forschungsstand sowie aktuell diskutierte Hypothesen bezüglich des Entstehens und der Entwicklung von Complex predicates zusammengefasst und diskutiert. Dabei erweist sich insbesondere die Annahme dass sich Complex predicates entlang eines Grammatikalisierungspfads von Parataxis zu Affix (per Serialisierung, Light verb und Auxiliarisierung) entwickeln als zu einfach. Abschließend werden Argumente für und gegen die Annahme, dass Light verbs historisch stabil sind, abgewogen. French Malgré la présence de constructions à prédicats complexes (ce qui inclut les constructions à verbes légers et les verbes en série) dans un grand nombre de langues, ces structures n'ont suscité à ce jour qu'un nombre restreint d'études diachroniques. Dans ce travail, je passe ces études en revue, et j'examine les hypothèses actuellement entretenues sur l'origine et le développement des prédicats complexes. En particulier, je montre que l'hypothèse du développement graduel des prédicats complexes de la parataxe à l'affixation (en passant par la sérialisation, les verbes légers, et l'auxiliation) est trop simpliste. Finalement, je résume les arguments pour ou contre l'analyse des verbes légers comme constructions stables.},

The third section introduces the words that comprise a noun phrase including nouns, personal pronouns, and pronominal demonstrative forms, which are marked on a spatial axis (e.g. proximate, neutral, distal, and non-visible). The fourth section examines the affixes that combine with verb stems to form clauses and sentences. This includes a discussion of the basic SV/AOV constituent order, and the ergative/absolutive alignment system. Here nominalization/relativization, a common feature of Tibeto-Burman languages, is also presented along with the clause chaining strategy commonly found in narrative discourse.},

Contributions focus on four central topics: firstly, the question of the locus of variation, whether the attested variation may plausibly be understood in parametric terms and, if so, what form such parameters might take; secondly, the fate of one of the most prominent early parameters, the Null Subject Parameter; thirdly, the matter of parametric clusters more generally; and finally, acquisition issues.},

	abstract = {All languages have words, such as English hot and cold, hard and soft, rough and smooth, and heavy and light, which attribute qualities to things. This paper maps out how such descriptors can be analysed in the natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) framework, in terms of like and other semantic primes configured into a particular semantic schema: essentially, touching something with a part of the body, feeling something in that part, knowing something about that thing because of it, and thinking about that thing in a certain way because of it. Far from representing objective properties of things “as such”, it emerges that physical quality concepts refer to embodied human experiences and embodied human sensations. Comparisons with French, Polish and Korean show that the semantics of such words may differ significantly from language to language.},

	isbn = {9781881526438},
	abstract = {This book argues for a conception of linguistic organisation involving the factorisation of syntactically relevant information into at least four parallel dimensions of structure: semantic structure, argument structure, grammatical function structure, and grammatical category structure. The author argues that these dimensions are co-present, being simultaneously accessible for the statement of regularities. Different principles of grammar may either reinforce one another, or conflict with one another. The observed facts of a language then turn out to be the result of interaction among the reinforcing and conflicting principles. Tara Mohanan was born in Kerala, India, spent her childhood in various parts of Northern India, and grew up speaking both Malayalam and Hindi as a mother tongue. Tara now lives in Singapore with her husband and daughter, and teaches linguistics at the National University of Singapore.},

They have proven problematic for linguistic theory, particularly for proposed distinctions between the lexicon, morphology, and syntax.

The volume showcases the 'coverb construction' a complex predicate construction which, though widespread, has received little attention in the literature. The coverb construction contrasts with more familiar serial verb constructions. The coverb construction generally maps only to event structures like those of monomorphemic verbs, whereas serial verb constructions map to a range of event structures differing from those of monomorphemic verbs. The volume coverage is truly cross-linguistic, including languages from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, East Africa and North America.

	isbn = {9780226300863},
	shorttitle = {Constructions},
	abstract = {Drawing on work in linguistics, language acquisition, and computer science, Adele E. Goldberg proposes that grammatical constructions play a central role in the relation between the form and meaning of simple sentences. She demonstrates that the syntactic patterns associated with simple sentences are imbued with meaning—that the constructions themselves carry meaning independently of the words in a sentence.Goldberg provides a comprehensive account of the relation between verbs and constructions, offering ways to relate verb and constructional meaning, and to capture relations among constructions and generalizations over constructions. Prototypes, frame semantics, and metaphor are shown to play crucial roles. In addition, Goldberg presents specific analyses of several constructions, including the ditransitive and the resultative constructions, revealing systematic semantic generalizations.Through a comparison with other current approaches to argument structure phenomena, this book narrows the gap between generative and cognitive theories of language.},

	abstract = {A systematic collection of problems and counterexamples is presented for predictions of patterns of relational marking on noun phrases in terms of a noun phrase hierarchy (also known as animacy hierarchy), as conceived of by Silverstein (1976) and others. In seeking to account for case marking distributions that are at odds with the three main principles underlying the noun phrase hierarchy – role expectation, marking economy, scalar continuity –, the ordering of 1st and 2nd person pronouns on top of the hierarchy is given particular attention. Several ways of liberalizing noun phrase rankings in terms of feature systems, in particular an equal ranking for speech-act participants, are considered in order to square hierarchy predictions with the attested diversity of pronominal case marking in split alignment systems.

Presupposing very little prior knowledge of linguistics, the book guides the reader from absolute basics to the most recent theoretical developments. Written in an accessible style, and including a wealth of exercises, this textbook is designed so that it can be used either on courses explicitly focused on morphology or as an adjunct to other courses, particularly in generative syntax and in phonology.The book opens with an account of the phenomena studied by morphologists, an outline of classical problems and an introduction to the earliest models of morphology proposed within the generative paradigm. Its second part deals with the interface between morphology and phonology and includes a detailed discussion of lexical Phonology, and related models, as well as a variety of types of nonconcatenative morphology.Part III begins with a comprehensive introduction to more recent theories of word structure, including inflectional morphology. Subsequent chapters examine the interface between morphology and syntax, exploring the processes which affect grammatical relations, such as passives and causatives. Further chapters examine compounding processes and the morphology, phonology and syntax of clitic systems. The final part of the book includes a full discussion of "bracketing paradoxes" and closes with a survey of models of morphology and competing views of the place of morphology in linguistic theory.},

	abstract = {I specify a typology for the extreme of inflectional morphology, namely suppletion (as in go ∼ went). This is an unusual enterprise within typology, and it requires a 'canonical' approach. That is, I define the canonical or best instance, through a set of converging criteria, and use this point in theoretical space to locate the various occurring types. Thus the criteria establish the dimensions along which specific instances of suppletion are found, allowing me to calibrate examples out from the canonical. The criteria fall into two main areas, those internal to the lexeme and those external to it. Moreover, I find interactions with other morphological phenomena and discuss four of them: syncretism, periphrasis, overdifferentiation, and reduplication. These remarkable instances of suppletion, particularly when in interaction with other phenomena, extend the boundary of the notion 'possible word'. Besides laying out the possibilities for the specific phenomenon of suppletion, I show how a canonical approach allows progress in typology, even in the most challenging areas.},

This is evidence of a larger problem involving the interface between syntax and morphology: inflectional morphology is supposed to specify syntactic function, but sometimes it sends out the wrong signal. Although the problem is as old as the Western linguistic tradition, no generally accepted account of it has yet been given, and it is safe to say that all current theories of language have been constructed as if deponency did not exist.  In recent years, however, linguists have begun to confront its theoretical implications, albeit largely in isolation from each other. There is as yet no definitive statement of the problem, nor any generally accepted definition of its nature and scope.  This volume brings together the findings of leading scholars working in the area of morphological mismatches, and represents the first book-length typological and theoretical treatment of the topic. It will establish the important role that research on deponency has to play in contemporary linguistics, and set the standard for future work.},

In addition to identifying types of suppletion which occur cross-linguistically, the study brings to light areal patterns of the occurrence of suppletive forms in verb paradigms. Several hypotheses as regards the diachronic development of suppletive forms are presented as well. The author also seeks to explore the methodological issues of evaluating the frequency of linguistic features in large language samples by introducing a method of weighting languages according to their genetic relatedness. All figures obtained in this way are compared to the proportions yielded by more familiar counting methods, and the results and implications of the different procedures are compared and discussed throughout.},

	volume = {21},
	abstract = {This paper focuses on Swedish nominal compounds with a personal proper name as their first
component (PropN-compounds), e.g. en Mozart+sonat ‘a Mozart sonata’ or Palme+mord-et ‘the Palme
murder’ (‘Palme+murder-the’), and aims at showing that such compounds are truly situated between
lexicon and syntax. Syntactic considerations are relevant for PropN-compounds for at least the
following reasons: a) since proper names themselves are often phrases rather than single words, the
first part of PropN-compounds can be a phrase, including pre- and postposed attributes of varying
complexity, coordination and even definite suffixed articles on the head noun; b) PropNcompounds
are often involved in competition with syntactic coding strategies, and c) the proper-names in
PropN-compounds are occasionally accessible for external anaphora. Lexical considerations are also
relevant for PropN-compounds: a) PropN-compounding provides a systematic way of creating new
lexical items, with many PropN-compounds fully conventionalized or on their way to full
conventionalization; b) various structural properties of PropNcompounds (e.g. recursion, the use of
proper names with attributes or of conjoined proper names as the non-head component) are
sensitive to the “lexicalization degree” of the involved elements, where lexicalization primarily refers
to their recognition as expressions for unitary concepts. It is suggested that some of the theoretical
claims on the morphology of compounding are not particularly relevant for PropN-compounds, since
their defining property is that they are based on personal proper names or on what is conceived of as
a personal proper name. These expressions can have quite different structural properties ranging from
single simplex words to phrases, but all these structures (including certain types of close appositional
structures) are allowed to function as the first-most component in compounds as long as they are
recognized as a name for a unique referent – a person or a group of persons. PropNcompounds in
Swedish are simply right-headed nominal compounds in which the first slot is occupied by any
expression that is recognized as a personal proper name (with the marginal exception of expressions
with a preposed syntactic determiner).},

Examination of the phenomenon across a large number of geographically and genetically diverse languages indicates that, where syntax and morphology diverge, incorporation is a solidly morphological device that derives lexical items, not sentences.

Differences in its productivity from language to language show that this development may be arrested at any point-resulting either in the eventual disappearance of the process, or in its resurgence as a productive system of affixation.},

Prior to such points, projectability is often limited to the progressive anticipation of small increments of talk. However, participants are able to achieve smooth speaker transitions with minimal gap or overlap through the use of specific grammatical and prosodic devices for marking possible points at which a transition may become relevant.},

In the previous edition (1984) the author deliberately chose to de-emphasize the more formal aspects of syntactic structure, in favor of a more comprehensive treatment of the semantic and pragmatic correlates of syntactic structure. With hindsight the author now finds the de-emphasis of the formal properties a somewhat regrettable choice, since it creates the false impression that one could somehow be a functionalist without being at the same time a structuralist. To redress the balance, explicit treatment is given to the core formal properties of syntactic constructions, such as constituency and hierarchy (phrase structure), grammatical relations and relational control, clause union, finiteness and governed constructions. At the same time, the cognitive and communicative underpinning of grammatical universals are further elucidated and underscored, and the interplay between grammar, cognition and neurology is outlined. Also the relevant typological database is expanded, now exploring in greater precision the bounds of syntactic diversity. Lastly, Syntax treats synchronic-typological diversity more explicitly as the dynamic by-product of diachronic development or grammaticalization. In so doing a parallel is drawn between linguistic diversity and diachrony on the one hand and biological diversity and evolution on the other. It is then suggested that as in biology synchronic universals of grammar are exercised and instantiated primarily as constraints on development, and are thus merely the apparent by-products of universal constraints on grammaticalization.},

	abstract = {This book investigates noun phrases in a representative sample of the world's 6,000 or so languages and proposes a semantic model to describe their underlying structure in any natural language. It examines the semantic and morpho-syntactic properties of the constituents of noun phrases. Indoing so it shows that the noun phrase word order patterns of any human language can be derived from three universal ordering principles and, furthermore, that these are all elaborations of one general iconic principle according to which elements that belong together semantically tend to occurtogether syntactically. Professor Rijkhoff analyses the noun phrase as a semantic hierarchy which accommodates four noun modifiers relating to quality, quantity, location, and discourse. Noun phrases and sentences can be similarly analysed, he argues, because they have the same underlying semantic structure thataccommodates the same kind of modifier categories. He introduces the notion of Seinsart or 'mode of being' as the nominal counterpart of Aktionsart 'mode of action' in verb semantics. He proposes a new grammatical category of nominal aspect and an implicational universal concerning the occurrence ofadjectives as a major word class in the part-of-speech system of a language. The book is clearly organized, easily accessible, and assumes no knowledge of a particular formal or functional theory. It will interest linguists and students of linguistics of all theoretical persuasions, as well as students of the cognitive sciences and anthropology.},

The book makes many observations and points about typology and areal features and includes a wealth of unfamiliar data.

The five basic kinds of illocutionary acts are: representatives (or assertives), directives, commissives, expressives, and declarations. Each of these notions is defined. An earlier attempt at constructing a taxonomy by Austin is defective for several reasons, especially in its lack of clear criteria for distinguishing one kind of illocutionary force from another. Paradigm performative verbs in each of the five categories exhibit different syntactical properties. These are explained.

Data from numerous languages are presented in order to show what parameters can contribute to the linguistic expression of transitive events typologically.

The semantic definition usually presented is, however, not sufficient, because there are many properties that can affect the structure of the basic transitive sentence without affecting the inherent semantic transitivity of the sentence in any major way. Some of the most important of these parameters are exemplified and discussed. Finally, a new, specified prototype is proposed.},

It discusses what prototypical transitivity is, why it should exist, and how it should be defined, as well as how this definition can be employed in the analysis of a number of phenomena of language, such as case-marking, experiencer constructions, and so-called ambitransitives. Also discussed is how a prototype analysis relates to other approaches to transitivity, such as that based on markedness. The basic claim is that transitivity is iconic: a construction with two distinct, independent arguments is prototypically used to refer to an event with two distinct, independent participants. From this principle, a unified account of the properties typically associated with transitivity can be derived, and an explanation for why these properties tend to correlate across languages can be given.},

I argue against the Head-Dependent Theory (HDT), according to which the correlations reflect a tendency towards consistent ordering of heads and dependents. I offer an alternative account, the Branching Direction Theory (BDT), based on consistent ordering of phrasal and nonphrasal elements.

It is controlled by the larynx and arose historically from the influence of laryngeal contrasts (such as voicing) in consonants. Languages may contrast at least four levels, and at least two different rises or falls. In phonology, tone acts largely independently of the segments of the word, showing remarkable mobility and stability under segmental deletion. Rising and falling tones are not indivisible but arise when two different level tones appear on the same syllable. Conversely, one tone can spread over several syllables, creating a tonal plateau.},

	abstract = {Data from four little-studied varieties of Indo-Aryan (Southern Palula, Northern Palula, Sawi and Kalkoti) spoken in the Hindu Kush is analyzed and discussed from a historical-comparative perspective. Evidence is presented showing that Kalkoti, until recently only tentatively classified, is part of this particular cluster of closely-related Shina varieties. An attempt is made at reconstructing some phonological and grammatical features of a common source speech, here named Proto-Dangari, and the order in which the present-day varieties may have split off. An important conclusion drawn is that Southern and Northern Palula probably are more distantly related than present-day similarities seem to indicate, the high degree of synchronic similarity instead being due to relatively recent convergence taking place in southern Chitral. It is hypothesized that the present speech communities are the result of two different westward routes of migration, one geographically linking Southern Palula (Ashreti) and Sawi with Chilas, the other linking Northern Palula (Biori) and Kalkoti with Tangir, both located in the same general area of the main Indus Valley.},
