\BackBody{This work is devoted to morphosyntactic processing in the earliest stages of L2 Polish. The target structure taken into consideration is the morphosyntactic opposition between the nominative and accusative case, respectively corresponding to the subject and object function. This is the first book-length work devoted to the VILLA project, a first-exposure experiment in which 90 adult learners with five different L1s took part in a 14-hour Polish course under controlled input conditions. As participants had never been exposed to Polish or other Slavic languages, the study portrays the very first contact with a completely new target language. The book offers an in-depth analysis of sensitive methodological points like the role of input properties and cross-linguistic influence on morphosyntactic processing, but also the impact of semantics on semi-spontaneous production and variability related to elicitation techniques.}
