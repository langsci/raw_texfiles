\title{{NP}-internal possessive constructions in {Hoocąk} and other {Siouan} languages}
\abstract{Languages usually have more than one construction to express a possessive relationship. Possessive constructions in an individual language usually express semantically different relations, which are traditionally subsumed under the notion of possession such as part-whole relationships, kinship relationships, prototypical ownership, and others. Hooc\k{a}k and the other Siouan languages are no exception from this many-to-many relationship between possessive constructions and semantic kinds of possession. The present paper deals with NP-internal types of possession in Siouan languages leaving aside constructions that express possession on the clause level such as benefactive applicatives, reflexive possessives and the predicative possession. The NP-internal possessive constructions will be examined according to the semantic/syntactic nature of the possessor (regarding the Animacy Hierarchy), and the semantic nature of the possessed (alienable/ inalienable distinction). I will begin with an analysis of Hooc\k{a}k and will then compare the Hooc\k{a}k constructions with the corresponding ones in some other Siouan languages. At least one language of each sub-branch of Siouan will be discussed. It will be shown that the choice of differlakota
ent NP-internal possessive constructions depends on both semantic scales (the Animacy Hierarchy and the alienable/inalienable distinction), but in each Siouan language in very individual ways.

\section{The structure of NP-internal possessive constructions}
It may safely be assumed that all languages have grammatical and lexical means to express a possessive relation between an entity A and an entity B. Semantically, possession is a cover term for a broad range of distinct relations, which are expressed by possessive constructions (PC) in the languages of the world. Central to the notion of grammatical possession are the relations of ownership, whole-part relations, and kinship relations. Less central to the general notion of possession are attribution of a property, spatial relations, association, and perhaps nominalization. All these relations may be expressed by NP-internal possessive constructions in English as exemplified in \tabref{semantics}.\footnote{See \citet[262--267]{Dixon2010} for a more detailed discussion of these relations.}

\begin{table}
\caption{Semantics of possessive relation in the broad sense (cf. \citealt[262--267]{Dixon2010})} \label{semantics}

\begin{tabular}{ c c c l }
\lsptoprule

\lspbottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Not all of the different kinds of relations in \tabref{semantics} can be expressed by possessive constructions in all languages, but in most cases ownership, whole-part, and kinship relations are covered by their NP-internal PCs. It is still an open question, whether there is a general semantic notion of possession that covers all relations expressed by PCs. There is at least one prominent approach to possession which claims that there is a semantic prototype with a core and a periphery (cf. Seiler's prototype approach (\citealt{Seiler1983,Seiler2001}); and a critical examination of it in \citealt{Helmbrecht2003}). Others reject this idea (cf. for instance \citealt{Heine1997}; \citealt[263]{Dixon2010} and others).

Languages usually have more than one syntactic construction expressing possessive relations on the clause level as well as on the NP level. In Tables \ref{typology1} and \ref{typology2}, there are examples of different possessive constructions from Hooc\k{a}k,\footnote{Hooc\k{a}k, formerly also known as Winnebago, is a Siouan language still spoken in Wisconsin. Hooc\k{a}k together with Otoe, Ioway, and Missouria forms the Winnebago-Chiwere sub-branch of Mississippi-Valley Siouan. For the widely accepted classification of Siouan languages see, for instance, \citet{Rood1979}, \citet[501]{Mithun1999}, and  \citet{ParksRankin2001}.} English and German for illustrative purposes.

The present paper deals only with PCs on the NP level. Languages often possess more than just one NP-internal PC, as it is the case for instance in English. English has the \textit{of}-construction and the genitive \textit{=s} construction to express possession NP-internally; similarly for German. If there are two or more NP-internal PCs in a language, the choice of these constructions often depends on the semantic and syntactic category of the possessor and/or the semantic type of the possessed entity. 

With regard to the possessor, the choice of the PC may depend on the specific NP type of the possessor. For instance, if the possessor is expressed by means of a possessive pronoun a different construction may be used than with a possessor expressed by a lexical noun phrase. If the possessor is a proper name or kinship term this may determine the selection of a specific PC, too. Animacy proper of the possessor, i.e. possessor NPs with a human, animate or inanimate common noun, may play a role as well. The implicational scale that brings together these different NP-types that may be relevant for the choice of different NP-internal PCs in Siouan languages as well is called Animacy Hierarchy (AH). The AH is a scale that describes many different grammatical phenomena cross-linguistically. The AH is usually considered as: 1/2 > 3 > proper noun/kin term > human common noun > animate common noun > inanimate common noun (cf. for instance \citealt{Dixon1979}; \citealt{Comrie1981}; \citealt{Croft2003}).

With regard to the possessed, it can be observed that the choice of the NP-internal PC depends on the semantic class of the possessed, i.e. these languages often have two sets of nouns, so that set\textsubscript{1} nouns designating the possessed entity require one type of the PC, and set\textsubscript{2} nouns designating the possessed entity the other. This classification of nouns with regard to PCs is better known under the heading alienable versus inalienable distinction. Alienable nouns usually designate entities that can be owned in the prototypical sense implying that the possessor has full control over these possessed entities; for instance the possessor can sell them, give them away, and so on. The class of inalienable nouns is much more heterogeneous with regard to the semantics; inalienable nouns designate entities that bear a close association to the possessor implying that the possessor has no or only a limited control over them. Often, kinship terms, body part terms, and other relational nouns (local/spatial nouns) belong to this class. 
With regard to the formal marking of the respective PCs, the following possibilities can be distinguished (cf. \citealt[286--290]{Dixon2010}):

\vspace{1em}
i.	the alienable PC is similar to that for inalienable possession with an added grammatical element;

ii.	the grammatical marking for alienable possession is longer than that for inalienable possession;

iii.	the alienable PC requires a classifier, the inalienable construction does not;

iv.	overt marking only in an alienable PC;
\vspace{1em}

The possibilities i-iv cover the cross-linguistic observation that inalienable PCs tend to be shorter and morphological less complex than alienable PCs. In other words, the PC for alienable possession is always more marked than the PC for inalienable possession. In what follows it will be shown that this observation also holds in general for the different NP-internal PCs in Siouan.

\section{Methodical remarks}

The goal of this study is to search for all different NP-internal PCs in selected Siouan languages and to describe the conditioning factors for their choice. The guiding hypothesis is that the syntactic/semantic properties of the possessor (Animacy Hierarchy) and the semantic properties of the possessed (alienable vs. inalienable) is a fruitful notional frame for the discovery and the description of the splits in the expression of possession; cf. Table 3. 
	
Typological studies on possession show that the properties of the possessive relation itself such as actual possession vs. possession in the past, temporary possession vs. permanent possession, close possession vs. loose possession and so on, may trigger a constructional split too, in some languages (cf. \citealt[274--276]{Dixon2010}). This is, as far as I can see, not the case in Siouan languages. Therefore, these semantic parameters won't play a role in the rest of the paper. 

\begin{table}
\caption{Semantic/syntactic parameters for constructional splits in NP-internal possessive constructions.} \label{parameters}

\begin{tabular}[h]{ l l l }

\end{table}

The properties of the possessor and the possessed as summarized in \tabref{parameters} serve as a kind of questionnaire or guideline for the search for constructional splits in the various grammatical descriptions of Siouan languages that are used here. The data and descriptions of PCs are taken from the grammars that are available for the different Siouan languages. For Hoocąk, data fro m a text corpus and from fieldwork sessions will be taken. 

I will exclude the question of the relation between NP-internal PCs and the clause level PCs for later research. My own experience with text data from Hoocąk makes me think that clause level PCs are often preferred over the NP-internal PCs at least in Hoocąk, but this needs to be shown in more detail. 

\section{NP-internal possession in Hoocąk}

Hoocąk and Chiwere (Missouria, Otoe, Ioway) are closely related and constitute the Winnebago-Chiwere sub-branch of the Mississippi Valley group of the Siouan languages. Hoocąk is taken as a representative of this sub-branch, then. 

Hoocąk has no possessive pronouns comparable to English \textit{my, your, his, her}, etc., no nominal case marking in general, and no genitive case marker in particular. In addition, there are no connectives, linkers or possessive markers, i.e. grammatical forms that indicate a possessive relation between two nominals. Hoocąk has in principal two different types of NP-internal PCs. The first one is a simple juxtaposition of two nouns without any special possessive marking, see example \REF{petersdog} below. The second type of PC is a complex construction with an inflected verb of possession, e.g. \textit{=hii} 'have.kin' plus a definite article nominalizing the entire construction illustrated in example \REF{myaunts}. Without this definite article, we have a clause expressing a kind of predicative possession. 

\ea  \label{petersdog}
\langinfo{Hoocąk} {}{\citealt[16]{Helmbrecht2003}} \\
\ea
\glll Petergá šųųkrá\\
Peter=gá     šųųk=rá \\

hicųwį́  wa-haa=rá \\
aunt     \textsc{obj.3pl}-have.kin(\textsc{1e.u})=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `my aunts'
\z
\z

Both types of NP-internal PC will be discussed in more detail in the subsequent sections.

\subsection{Juxtaposition}\label{sec:helmbrecht:3.1}

The semantic/syntactic type of the possessor does not require the choice of the juxtaposition PC in Hoocąk with one exception. If the possessor is a speech act participant or a third person, the second construction type with the nominalized possessive verb has to be chosen obligatorily (see \sectref{nomvposs} below).

The following series of examples demonstrates that neither the AH – except with regard the pronoun/noun distinction – nor the distinction between alienable vs. inalienable nouns have any effect on the expression of attributive possession in Hoocąk. The example in \REF{petersfather} is an attributive possessive relation with a proper name as possessor and a kinship term as possessed noun. The relation is inherent and inalienable. The definite article is required.

\ea Hoocąk (\citealt[16]{Helmbrecht2003}) \label{petersfather}

\glll Petergá hi'\k{a}crá\\
Peter=gá       hi'\k{a}c=rá \\
  P.=\textsc{prop} father=\textsc{def} \\
\glt`Peter's father'
\z

The possessive relation in \REF{womansfacea} is a part-whole relationship with a human possessor and a body part term as possessed. The possessive relation is inherent and inalienable. The same holds for the examples in \REF{womansfaceb}-\REF{womansfacec}. The whole PC needs to be specified by a determiner, i.e. the definite article, or a demonstrative pronoun. If there is a definite article following the possessor (cf. \REF{womansfaceb}), then it is the possession of a specific and definite possessor. If the indefinite article follows the possessor (cf. \REF{womansfacec}), it is the possession of an indefinite possessor. 

\ea Hoocąk (\citealt[13]{Helmbrecht2003})\label{womansface}
\ea \label{womansfacea}
\gll hinų́k    hišja=rá \\
woman face=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `the woman's face'
\ex\label{womansfaceb}
\gll hinų́́k=\textbf{rá}         hišja=rá \\
woman=\textbf{\textsc{def}} face=\textsc{def} \\

\ex\label{womansfacec}
\gll hinų́́k=\textbf{íz\k{a}} hišja=ra \\
woman=\textbf{\textsc{def}}  face=\textsc{def} \\ 
\glt `the face of an (indefinite) woman'
\z
\z

The PCs in \REF{johnscar} and \REF{petersdog} (above) are alienable. Both contain alienable possessed nouns, the inanimate noun \textit{hiráati} `car' and the animate noun \textit{šųųk} `dog'. The possessor is a human being (proper name) in both cases. 

\ea Hoocąk (\citealt[13]{Helmbrecht2003}) \label{johnscar}

\gll John=ga      hiráati=ra \\
J.=\textsc{prop} car=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `John's car'
\z

The possessive relation in \REF{leg} includes a body part term as possessed noun (inseparable, inalienable) with a non-human possessor. The example in \REF{wheel} represents a part-whole relation with an inanimate object as possessor and an inanimate object as possessed (separable, alienable). Both possessors in \REF{leg} and \REF{wheel} can be interpreted either as specific or as generic. 

\ea Hoocąk (\citealt[13]{Helmbrecht2003}) \label{leg}

\gll wijúk huu=rá \\
cat      leg=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `the leg(s) of the/a cat'
\z

\ea Hooc\k{a}k (\citealt[13]{Helmbrecht2003}) \label{wheel}

\gll waž\k{a}tíre hogis=rá \\
car  circular.part=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `the wheel(s) of a/the car'
\z

Note that the constructions in \REF{leg} and \REF{wheel} often resemble a nominal compound with the first noun specifying the second noun thus creating a new word and concept instead of expressing a possessive relation. For instance, the Hoocąk word \textit{n\k{a}\k{a}h\'a} `bark' is a compound of the noun \textit{n\k{a}\k{a}} `tree' and \textit{haa} `skin, pelt, hide' thus giving the new concept `tree skin' which corresponds to `bark' in English. This combination of two nouns is a nominal compound on phonological grounds. The vowel in the second noun is shortened, which is a normal word-internal process in Hoocąk. However, the boundary between compound and juxtaposition is often blurred and the function "the first noun specifies the second" can be found in phrasal juxtaposition as well as in nominal compounding. The expressions in \REF{leg} and \REF{wheel} are certainly phrasal in nature. Both words in these expressions have their own primary accent and there are no sandhi processes between the two nouns. 

The same type of construction employed for the expression of possession in the preceding examples is also used for the expression of spatial relations. There are numerous local nouns such as \textit{coow\'e}  `front part', \textit{n\k{a}\k{a}k\'e} `back part', \textit{rook} `inside', \textit{hihák} `top, surface', and so on, which are used to express the specific local/ spatial relation of an object vis-à-vis the spatial region of another object. The local nouns are the possessed nouns in these constructions. They designate the spatial position of the possessor. The possessor functions as the reference point (cf. \citealt{Langacker1993}) of the localization, it represents the object with regard to which another one is localized, cf. the examples in \REF{dogposition}. The clitic \textit{=eja} `there' is a local adverb almost obligatorily used in these constructions. 
 
\ea Hooc\k{a}k (\citealt[14]{Helmbrecht2003}) \label{dogposition}

\ea 
\glll \v{s}\k{u}\k{u}kr\'a hirar\'uti  coow\'eja `ak\v{s}\k{a}n\k{a}  \\
\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k=r\'a \textbf{hirar\'uti}  \textbf{coow=\'eja} `ak=\v{s}\k{a}n\k{a} \\ 
dog=\textsc{def} \textbf{car} \textbf{front=there} be.lying=\textsc{decl} \\
\glt `The dog is (in a lying position) in front of the car.'

\ex 
\glll šųųkrá hirarúti hihákeja jeen\k{a}\\
\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k=r\'a \textbf{hirar\'uti} \textbf{hih\'ak=eja} jee=n\k{a} \\
dog=\textsc{def}  \textbf{car} \textbf{top=there} be.standing=\textsc{decl} \\
\glt `The dog is (in a standing position) on the top of the car.'

\ex 
\glll šųųkrá hirarúti rookéja n\k{a}k\v{s}\k{a}n\k{a}\\
\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k=r\'a   \textbf{hirar\'uti} \textbf{rook=\'eja} n\k{a}k=\v{s}\k{a}n\k{a} \\
dog=\textsc{def} \textbf{car} \textbf{inside=there} be.sitting=\textsc{decl} \\
\glt` The dog is (in a sitting position) inside of the car.'
\z
\z

The expressions in examples \REF{petersfather} through \REF{dogposition} show that the semantic nature of a lexical possessor does not trigger a shift to another construction type: this holds if the possessor is a proper name (=\textit{ga} \textsc{prop}), human noun (=\textsc{def/=indef/}=Ø), animate noun (=\textsc{def/=indef}/=Ø), or inanimate noun (=\textsc{def/=indef}/=Ø). In addition, the expressions in \REF{petersfather} through \REF{dogposition} show that there is no alienable-inalienable distinction: the same construction type is chosen with kinship terms, body part terms, relational spatial nouns, as well as with alienable nouns. The possessor noun may be marked by a definite (\textsc{def}), an indefinite (\textsc{indef}) article, or by zero. If the possessor is a proper name (\textsc{prop}), it will be marked by the proper name marker. The entire PC is always definite (\textsc{def}) (marked on the possessed noun) except with spatial nouns. They are usually marked by means of a local adverb clitic =\textit{eja} 'there' which – in this respect – could also be analyzed as a general local postposition. The examples also show that this type of PC may express real ownership, part-whole relations, kinship relations, and spatial relations.
 
\subsection{Nominalized verbal possessive constructions}\label{sec:helmbrecht:3.2} \label{nomvposs}

The juxtaposition of two nominals is a general construction type to express possession and other binary relations in Hoocąk. There is, however, an alternative NP-internal possessive construction, which indeed exhibits a classification of nouns: inalienable nouns such as kinship terms, domestic (pet) animals, and alienable nouns. These alternative constructions are in each case a nominalized version of the possessive predication employing different possessive verbs for different types of possessed entities. The nominalized possessive clauses appear in the same syntactic position as the juxtaposed nouns, i.e. in a noun phrase position of the clause. 

\ea Hoocąk (\citealt[16]{Helmbrecht2003}) \label{seecar}

\ea 
\gll \textbf{John=g\'a hir\'aati=ra}  hac\'aa=n\k{a} \\
\textbf{J.=\textsc{prop} car=\textsc{def}} see(\textsc{1e.a}\&\textsc{obj.3sg}=\textsc{decl} \\
\glt `I see John's car.'  

\ex 
\gll J\textbf{ohn=g\'a hir\'aati han\k{i}=r\'a} hac\'aa=n\k{a}  \\
\textbf{J.=\textsc{prop} car own(\textsc{sbj.3sg}\&\textsc{obj.3sg})=\textsc{def}} see(\textsc{1e.a}\&\textsc{obj.3sg})=\textsc{decl}  \\
\glt `I see John's car.'
\z
\z 

Both clauses in \REF{seecar} have the same translation, but speakers indicate that they prefer the nominalized variant over the juxtaposed variant. The same constructional pairs exist for possessive constructions with kinship terms and pet animals (domestic animals). These nominalized possessive clauses represent a kind of transition from attributive to predicative possession. The general structure of these nominalized possessive clauses is given in \REF{generalstructure}.

\ea General structure of the nominalized verbal possessive construction \label{generalstructure}

[(N-POSSESSOR\textsubscript{i})  N-POSSESSED\textsubscript{j}    PRO\textsubscript{j}-PRO\textsubscript{i}-Verb of possession=DET]\textsubscript{NP}
\z

If the possessor is a speech act participant or third person, these nominalized PCs are the only possibility. Since the possessor is often a topic (given and definite) in discourse and hence expressed pronominally as a \textsc{3sg}, this type of PC prevails in discourse over the alternative juxtaposition. Note that \textsc{3sg} arguments are always marked zero on the verbs. Both entities X\textsubscript{possessor} and Y\textsubscript{possessed} are cross-referenced in the verb of possession utilizing the two different series of pronominal prefixes, the actor/subject series for the possessor and the undergoer/object series for the possessed. The verbs of possession are treated as regular transitive verbs.

If the possessor is a lexical human noun, this construction type competes with the juxtaposition type of PCs dealt with in the preceding section; cf. the following examples in \REF{petersthings}.
 
\ea Hoocąk (\citealt[16]{Helmbrecht2003}) \label{petersthings}

\ea 
\glll Peterga hi'ą́c hiirá \\
Peter=ga        hi’ą́́c   \textbf{hii}=ra \\
P.=\textsc{prop}  father have.kin=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `Peter's father'

\ex 
\glll Peterga šų́ųk nįįhíra \\
Peter=ga      šų́́ųk   \textbf{nįįhí}=ra \\
P.=\textsc{prop} dog   have.pet=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `Peter's dog'

\ex \gll John=gá      hiráati \textbf{hanį}=rá \\
J.=\textsc{prop} car       own=\textsc{def} \\
\glt `John's car'

\z \z

The verbs of possession that are used in the PCs in \REF{petersthings} are restricted in their usage. The verb \textit{=hii} `X has Y as kin' can only be used with kinship terms or with terms designating close friends. This verb is homophonous with the causative auxiliary \textit{=hii} `to cause'. There are reasons to believe that both verbs are historically cognate, and that they should be considered as different usages of one verb rather than homonyms. The main reason for this analysis is that the causative verb \textit{=hii} has an irregular personal inflection, and the possessive verb \textit{=hii} shows exactly the same pattern. 

The possessive verb \textit{nįįh\'i} `X has Y as pet' is used only with pet animals. Usually, pet animals are domesticated animals such as cats, and dogs, etc. The semantic boundaries of this class are not clear-cut. Historically, \textit{nįįhí} is presumably a combination of *\textit{nį} `to live, living thing', which does not occur independently in Hoocąk and the causative auxiliary \textit{=hii}.\footnote{*\textit{n\k{i}} is the reconstructed Proto-Mississippi-Valley Siouan form for `live, be alive' (cf. \citealt{RankinEtAl2015AccessMay}). This form can be found in other verbs in Hooc\k{a}k such as \textit{n\k{i}\k{i}h\'a} `to breathe'  or in \textit{n\k{i}\k{i}'\'{\k{a}}p} `be alive'.} The verb \textit{nįįhí} shows the same inflectional irregularities as the causative verb \textit{=hii}. 

The possessive verb \textit{han\k{i}} `to own' is a regular (lexical) transitive verb designating the possession of alienable entities such as inanimate objects, artifacts, animals, and so on. Body parts belong to this group of nouns, too. It is restricted to human possessors. Part-whole relations with inanimate possessors, on the other hand, are never expressed with this construction. Cf. the summary in \tabref{alienabilityinhochunk}.

All three verbs in \tabref{alienabilityinhochunk} form the same type of nominalized verbal PC with pronominal and lexical human possessors. There is no difference between them with regard to structural markedness or with regard to the iconic relationship observed for the inalienable vs. alienable distinction and the size of the corresponding PCs. The paradigms for all three verbs of possession are given below; cf. \tabref{havekin}, \tabref{havepet}, and \tabref{haveparadigm}. The paradigms contain only constructions with a \textsc{3sg} possessed noun. If the possessed nouns were plural (`aunts', `dogs', and `cars') the verbs of possession would be inflected for the third person plural object (wa- \textsc{obj.3pl}).

The kinship term \textit{hicųwį́} `aunt (father's sister)' has a variant form that is used for address purposes, \textit{cųwį́} `(my) aunt!'. These address forms of kinship terms --- often simply lacking the initial syllable \textit{hi-} --- cannot occur in a possessive construction. This seems to be a general rule for obvious reasons. The usage of kinship terms as address terms usually presupposes that such a kinship relation holds between speaker and hearer. 

There is another kind of variation in the paradigm of kinship possession that may be rooted in the mutual knowledge of the interlocutors. The common determiner in possessive constructions with a kinship term is the definite article \textit{=ra}. However, in the second person singular and plural the determiner is \textit{=ga}, a deictic element also used for the indication of proper names. Lipkind claims that \textit{=ga} has to be used exclusively in these instances (cf. \citealt[31]{Lipkind1945}), but Hoocąk speakers gave me forms that show that there is actually a choice between \textit{=ra} and \textit{=ga} in the second person and in the first person inclusive dual form;\footnote{I am particularly grateful to Henning Garvin\ia{Garvin, Henning} helping me to collect the relevant forms here.} \textit{=ga} is ungrammatical in all other person categories. One of my most important language consultants, Phil Mike\ia{Mike, Phil}, indicated to me that this choice has to do with the mutual knowledge of the kinsman by both interlocutors. The definite article is used in the second person, if the speaker does not know the kinsman (assuming that the hearer knows his or her kinsmen), but \textit{=ga} is used when both interlocutors know the person talked about (which is more naturally the case if the speaker talks about the kinsman of the hearer). This could also explain why \textit{=ga} is not allowed if the possessed is plural. The deictic suffix \textit{=ga} is also used with the address forms of kinship terms indicating the first person as possessor. \citet[31]{Lipkind1945} says that all kin terms with initial \textit{hi-} take \textit{haará} `my' in the first person; the few ones without it take solely \textit{=ga} instead; the reason is that the shorter forms are terms of address while the \textit{hi-} forms are terms for reference. For instance, the form \textit{cųwį́} is the address term corresponding to \textit{hicųwį́} 'aunt (father's sister)'. Hence the \textsc{1sg} possessive form is \textit{cųwį́-gá} which translates literally `that aunt' implying that everybody knows that she is the aunt of the speaker (EGO). It is a kind of reduced form of speaking. The address term implies that the person so addressed has the kin relation designated by the term toward the speaker. It is an effect of the Animacy Hierarchy. Shared background knowledge of the possessor plays an important role here (cf. also \citealt[26f]{Heine1997}).\footnote{This can also be interpreted as an instance where the inherent relationality of kin terms leads to a structural reduction of the expression of possession confirming the prediction of the prototype approach.}

\section{Constructional splits in the other Siouan languages}

In what follows a few other Siouan languages are examined with regard to constructional splits that have to do with the NP type of the possessor and the semantics of the possessed. I will begin with the Northwestern Siouan languages Crow, Hidatsa, and Mandan (\sectref{crow}--\ref{mandan}), then I will continue with Lakota (the Dakotan sub-branch of Mississippi-Valley Siouan; \sectref{lakota}) and Osage (Dhegiha sub-branch of Mississippi-Valley Siouan; \sectref{osage}), and I will close this investigation with Biloxi as a representative of the South-Eastern branch of Siouan (Ohio-Valley Siouan; \sectref{biloxi}).
 
\subsection{Crow}\label{sec:helmbrecht:4.1} \label{crow} 
\subsubsection{The possessor}
Crow has four different NP-internal PCs depending on the semantic/syntactic nature of the possessor; cf. the examples in \REF{crowfather} through \REF{crowdeer}.

\z \z

No matter whether the possessed noun is alienable or inalienable, there has to be a possessive pronoun attached to the possessed noun indicating the possessor (cf. example \REF{crowfather}). The same is true if there is a lexical possessor in addition (cf. example \REF{crowcharlie}). The possessive prefix may be emphasized by means of a bound emphatic pronoun prefixed to the possessive prefix (cf. example \REF{crowbrother}). Interestingly, there are also PCs that do not show any possessive marking and hence look like a juxtaposition expressing a whole-part relationship, cf. the example in \REF{crowdeer}. I did not find more examples like this in Graczyk's grammar, so I cannot say if this is generally an alternative possibility or required for non-human possessors.

\subsubsection{The possessed}
Crow has different paradigms of proper bound possessive pronouns distinguishing different sets of possessed nouns according to the alienable versus inalienable distinction. The paradigm of possessive pronouns for alienable possession is given in \tabref{crowalienablepossession}; the paradigm of inalienable possession is given in \tabref{crowinalienablepossession}.

\begin{table}

\end{table}

The possessive pronouns of alienable possession in \tabref{crowalienablepossession} are formally invariable; they have an additional /\textit{-s}/ thus being phonologically more marked than the prefixes of the inalienable paradigm. The \textsc{2sg} possessive pronoun of the alienable paradigm shows a shift of the primary stress from the stem to the prefix, a pattern which is found also in some of the active verb paradigms. The \textsc{1i.pl} prefix \textit{balee-} is taken from the B-set pronominal paradigm for stative verbs. This form is added to the \textsc{3sg.poss} \textit{is-} prefix, probably a late innovation introducing a \textsc{1pl} inclusive-exclusive distinction into the alienable paradigm. This distinction is lacking in the inalienable paradigm of possessive pronouns as well as in the verbal paradigms. The suffixes in both paradigms (\textit{-o} in the alienable possessive paradigm, \textit{-úua} in the inalienable possessive paradigm) indicate the plurality of the possessor.

The paradigm of inalienable possession varies in form depending on the stem-initial sounds. There are three phonologically conditioned allomorphic paradigms, for stems in /d-/, /i+consonant-/, and /vowel-/. As can be seen in \tabref{crowinalienablepossession}, the stem itself also undergoes some sound changes.

There are, however, three additional paradigms of inalienable possession: a) one that marks possession with the undergoer series of pronominal prefixes (called B-set of pronominal prefixes in Graczyk's grammar), b) one with an irregular paradigm, and c) one residual paradigm that shows stem suppletion. \citet[57]{Graczyk2007} finds the following classification of nouns associated with these three different inalienable paradigms.

\begin{description}
\item[a)] Inalienable possession with the B-set prefixes is used with nouns referring to internal body parts such as `gland', `joint', `limb', `hip', `bone', `lung', `stomach', etc. (cf. \citealt[57]{Graczyk2007}).

\item[b)] There are not enough nouns requiring the irregular paradigm for a semantic classification, but they all seem to belong semantically rather to the inalienable class of nouns, though;

\item[c)] The nouns that require suppletive stems refer to kinship relations, clothing, and some culturally important possessions, cf. the examples in \tabref{crowsuppletion}. The first column shows the nouns in citation form, the second column in a possessive construction. The corresponding stems are clearly suppletive. 
\end{description}

\begin{table}
\caption{Suppletive stems in Crow (\citealt[58]{Graczyk2007})} \label{crowsuppletion}
\begin{tabular}[h]{ l l l l}

 ihkáa	 & `mother'	& is-ahká	& `his mother \\

alúuta &  `arrow' & is-aá &  `his arrow'\\
buú & `song'	&  is-huú & `his song'\\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

There is also a prefix \textit{bale-} that is used if inalienable nouns are used without indicating a possessor. This form is called depossessivizer in \citet[53/234]{Graczyk2007} and it is obligatorily used with unpossessed body part nouns. This form is not used with kinship terms.

\tabref{crowalienability} summarizes the findings with regard to the alienable/inalienable distinction. Inalienable nouns are a closed class of nouns in Crow. It is clear that the semantic classification of the nouns with regard to the different PCs is not sharp. There are even body part nouns that belong to the alienable class (set\textsubscript{5}). Gross modo, however, the nouns in set\textsubscript{1} - set\textsubscript{4} could be subsumed under a class of inalienable nouns semantically.

\subsection{Hidatsa}\label{sec:helmbrecht:4.2} \label{hidatsa} 
\subsubsection{The possessor}
Hidatsa and Crow are closely related and constitute the Missouri Valley sub-branch of Siouan. Although they belong to the same sub-branch of Siouan, there are differences in the expression of possession. Hidatsa has different PCs depending on the syntactic/semantic type of the possessor. As in Crow, there is an obligatory marking of the possessor on the possessed noun no matter whether the possessed noun is alienable or inalienable; cf. the alienable PC in \REF{hidatsahisdog}). If there is an additional lexical possessor, the structure of the PC in Hidatsa is analog to the one in Crow, cf. the alienable PC in \REF{hidatsamansdog}.

\ea Hidatsa (\citealt[81]{Boyle2007})
\ea \label{hidatsamansdog}
\glll macée idawashúga \\ 
wacée ita=wašúka \\

\ex \label{hidatsahisdog}
\glll idawashúga \\
ita=wašúka \\
\textsc{3sg.poss}=dog \\
\glt `his dog'
\z \z

\citet{Boyle2007} does not mention in his grammar of Hidatsa whether there exists a juxtaposition of possessor-possessed as another possible PC in Hidatsa. One of the peculiarities of PCs in Hidatsa is that they can freely be modified by a definite article and/or a demonstrative pronoun. Since there are a lot of similarities between Crow and Hidatsa, the discussion of the properties of the possessed will be brief.

\subsubsection{The possessed}

As in Crow, there are two paradigms of possessive pronouns in Hidatsa, one indicating inalienable possession, the other alienable possession; cf. \tabref{hidatsapronouns}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Alienable and inalienable possessive pronouns (\citealt[72]{Boyle2007}; 80)} \label{hidatsapronouns}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l}
\lsptoprule
& \multicolumn{2}{c }{inalienable possessive pronouns} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{alienable possessive pronouns} \\
\midrule
1 & ma-  /wa-/	 & `my'	 & mada= /wa-ta=/ & `my' \\
 
2 & ni-     /ri-/	& `your	& nida=   /ri-ta=/	& `your \\
 
3 & i-       /i-/	& `his, her'	& ida=     /i-ta=/	& `his, her' \\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The paradigm for inalienable possession shows --- as with Crow set\textsubscript{1} nouns --- phonologically conditioned allomorphy (stem-initial vowel vs. stem-initial consonant, and /r/-initial stems). It seems that there is no semantic sub-classification associated with the allomorphy in the inalienable prefixes and the corresponding irregularities. Therefore, I lumped these different formal properties of inalienable nouns together in one set\textsubscript{1} class of nouns in \tabref{hidatsaalienability}.
	
However, there are also differences. For instance, the 2POSS forms do not trigger a shift in stress assignment as in Crow, and the inalienable possessive prefixes are true prefixes, whereas the corresponding alienable forms are analyzed as clitics.  The alienable forms are identical to the ones for inalienable possession plus /\textit{ta-}/ which can be found in other Siouan languages as well (cf. e.g. in Lakota alienable PCs of set\textsubscript{4} nouns which have a \textit{-t\textsuperscript{h}a} prefix added to the undergoer pronominal prefix; cf. \tabref{lakotaalienability} below). There is no mention of a depossessivizer in Boyle's grammar of Hidatsa.

\subsection{Mandan}\label{sec:helmbrecht:4.3} \label{mandan}

Mandan is considered a proper sub-branch of Siouan neither belonging to the Missouri Valley nor the Mississippi Valley group of Siouan. 

The semantic/syntactic properties of the possessor and their possible effects on the choice of the PC are not discussed and described in Mixco's grammatical sketch (\citealt{Mixco1997a}). However, looking into the appended Mandan text, it seems that juxtapositions are possible in case  the possessor is a lexical noun. There is at least one clear example of this construction (cf. \REF{villagechief}) that shows that association may be expressed by this PC.

\ea Mandan (\citealt[70: text line 24]{Mixco1997a}) \label{villagechief}

\gll 'wį=ti   rų'wąʔk=ši-s \\
village man=good-\textsc{def} \\
\glt `the village chief'
\z

If the possessor is a speech act participant or a third person, one of the following distinct PCs has to be used. In one construction the possessive pronominal affixes, which are in principle identical to the undergoer series of pronominal affixes (called `stative' in \citealt[44]{Mixco1997a}) are attached directly to the noun stem that designates the possessed [\textsc{poss}-N\textsubscript{stem}]\textsubscript{inalienable possession}. This construction is used for inalienable possession; see the relevant forms in \tabref{mandanpossaffixes}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Possessor affixes in Mandan (\citealt[16f,44]{Mixco1997a})} \label{mandanpossaffixes}
\begin{tabular}{l l l }
\lsptoprule
& \textsc{sg} & \textsc{pl} \\
\midrule
1 & wį-\footnote{Note that this form of the \textsc{1sg.poss} differs from the corresponding form of the undergoer series, which is w\k{a}-. Mixco speculates that the w\k{i}- form is a contraction of w\k{a}- + i- for the third person, but provides no evidence for this idea.}  & ro:- \\
 
2 & rį- & rį-stem-rįt \\
 
3 & i- & -kræ\footnote {Mixco does not give the full paradigm, neither for the stative or undergoer affixes nor for the possessive affixes. This is the reason for the question mark. In addition I did not find a single example in Mixco's sketch of Mandan that corresponds to `their Y'. Note, however, that \citet[8]{Kennard1936} gives the form \textit{-k\textipa{E}r\textipa{E}} for the \textsc{3pl} possessive affix. The forms are identical, but the transcription is different.} \\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The second PC inserts a prefix \textit{ta-} between the stem and the possessive prefix [\textsc{poss}-\textit{ta}-N\textsubscript{stem}]\textsubscript{alienable possession}. This construction is used for alienable possession. The form \textit{ta-} as an alienable marker is cognate to Lakota \textit{t\textsuperscript{h}á-}, see below. The possessive prefixes are the same as in the inalienable PC, see \tabref{mandanpossaffixes}.

There are some peculiarities with PC for inalienable possession. First, there are some kinship terms that require a prefix \textit{ko-} for third person possessor. I suppose this form is related historically to \textit{ku-/tku-} in Lakota. Secondly, there are kinship terms and a few other alienable terms (old nominalized verb forms) that take the actor series of pronominal prefixes in order to express the possessor. For instance, the kinship term for `mother' takes the usual undergoer series of prefixes for inalienable possession, but requires \textit{ko-} for the third person possessor; cf. \REF{mandanmother}. 

\ea Mandan (\citealt[45]{Mixco1997a}) \label{mandanmother}

\ex \gll ko-hų:-s \\

The term for `father', on the other hand, requires the actor series of pronominal affixes in Mandan in order to express the possessor, cf. the examples in \REF{mandanfather}.

Interestingly, no mention is made of the way body parts are possessed in Mandan. A quick look into the Mandan text (cf. \citealt[66ff]{Mixco1997a}) reveals that body part nouns never occur in one of the above described PCs with possessive affixes. They appear always without the \textit{ta-} form and never carry any possessive affixes. The possessor always has to be inferred from the text.
 
\subsection{Lakota}\label{sec:helmbrecht:4.4} \label{lakota} 
\subsubsection{The possessor}
Lakota is a language of the Mississippi Valley Siouan languages, more specifically of the Dakotan sub-branch of this group. Lakota does employ possessive pronouns, which are almost entirely identical to the set of undergoer pronominal prefixes in stative/inactive verbs. If the possessor is a SAP/pronoun and the possessed noun belongs to the class of alienable nouns, the following constructions may be used. Note that the \textsc{1sg.poss} \textit{mi-} is a special form that does not correspond to the regular \textsc{1sg} form of the pronominal undergoer prefixes (\textit{ma-}).\footnote{Data in this section has been re-spelled in the current Lakota orthography.}

\z \z

There is no information about the conditions or the differences between the two constructions; it is clear that the one in \REF{lakotahouse} contains a stative verb of possession \textit{t\v{h}áwa-} `have' that is nominalized in this context inflecting for the person and number of the possessor and the number of the possessed. In \citet[458]{RoodTaylor1996} it is said that the stative verb of possession \textit{it\v{h}áwa} `have' depends only on the category of the possessor in this PC and not on the number of the possessed. It seems that this stative verb of possession has been grammaticalized towards a marker of possession quite recently in Lakota. 

The PCs in \REF{lakotalandwisdom} contain a marker for possession \textit{t\v{h}á-} `POSS' which is attached to the possessed noun and preceded by the pronominal affix of the possessor. This marker is common Siouan (cf. \citealt{RankinEtAl2015AccessMay}). If there are lexical nouns expressing the possessor, the following PCs are used.

Again we have two different PCs in the examples \REF{lakotadavidshorse}-\REF{lakotaabraham} with a lexical possessor, one with a verb of possession that is nominalized, and the other exhibiting a morphological possessor marking on the possessed noun. These examples represent alienable possessions. It can be concluded that the syntactic status of the possessor does not play a role for the choice of the PCs.

If the relation between the possessor and the possessed is a whole-part relation, or a partitive relation, or the possessor noun is an abstract noun or a nominalization, the following constructions are used.

Example \REF{lakotamanychiefs} is not really a PC, but a regular quantified NP. The same holds for \REF{lakotagoodworks}. It can hardly be considered a PC. It is rather a juxtaposition expressing a NP (`good works') modifying another NP (`man').

\subsubsection{The possessed}
There are different PCs according to the semantic type of the possessed noun; body part terms are simply affixed by the pronominal series of undergoer prefixes. Among the body part terms, there is a split between body parts that are ``conceived as particularly subject to willpower" (\citealt[128]{BoasDeloria1941}), and the others. \citet[100]{Buechel1939} describes this difference as ``possession of one's incorporeal constituents" versus ``possession of one's body and its physical parts"; compare the examples in \REF{lakotaincorporeal} and \REF{lakotabody}.

\ea Lakota (\citealt[101]{Buechel1939}) \label{lakotaincorporeal}

\textit{mi-ná\v{g}i ki\textipa{N} } \hspace{2.1em}		`my souls'

\textit{mi-\v{c}há\v{z}e  ki\textipa{N} } \hspace{1.9em} `my name'

\textit{mi-ó\v{h}'a\textipa{N} ki\textipa{N}}	\hspace{2em}		`my occupation'

etc.

\ex Lakota (\citealt[100]{Buechel1939}) \label{lakotabody}

\textit{ma-\v{c}hé\v{z}i ki\textipa{N} } \hspace{1.7em}	`my tongue'

\textit{ma-íšta ki\textipa{N} }	 \hspace{2.1em}	`my eye'

\textit{ma-sí ki\textipa{N} }		 \hspace{3em}	`my foot'

etc.
\z

Note that this distinction has become partially obsolete in contemporary Lakota. \citet[458]{RoodTaylor1996} note that this distinction is semantically maintained only in the Oglala variety of Lakota. There \textit{ma-} (\textsc{1sg.poss}) is used for ``concrete visible possessions", and \textit{mi-} (\textsc{1sg.poss}) for ``intangibles" (cf. \citealt[458]{RoodTaylor1996}). Otherwise, both forms are in free variation.

Kinship relations with a possessor of the first and second person are expressed solely by the possessive prefixes. A possessor of the third person requires an additional marker \textit{–ku, -tku, -\v{c}u} which is suffixed to the possessed kinship term; cf. \REF{lakotamygrandfather}.

\ea	Lakota (\citealt[102]{Buechel1939}) \label{lakotamygrandfather}

\textit{mi-t\v{h}\'u\textipa{N}kašila} \hspace{3.6em}		`my grandfather'
 
\textit{ni-t\v{h}\'u\textipa{N}kašila ki\textipa{N} } \hspace{2.3em}	`thy grandfather'

\textit{Ø-t\v{h}\'u\textipa{N}kaši\textbf{tku} ki\textipa{N} }	\hspace{1.8em} `his/her grandfather'
\z

\tabref{lakotaalienability} summarizes the findings. As was mentioned above, the set\textsubscript{1} and set\textsubscript{2} possessed nouns are no longer separated formally in Lakota (except for Oglala).

As in Hoocąk, the causative verb is used for the clause-level predicative expression of possession of a kinship term, cf. \REF{lakotahavegrandfather}.

\ea Lakota (\citealt[102]{Buechel1939}) \label{lakotahavegrandfather}

\glt `We have (him) as grandfather'
\z \z

I found no example showing that this verb of possession could be used like the alienable verb of possession \textit{t\v{h}\'awa} illustrated in \REF{lakotahouse} above. If this were the case, we would have a quite similar opposition of verbs of possession in Lakota as we found in Hoocąk. 

In addition, it should be mentioned that Lakota allows the non-modifying auto-referential usage of the possessive pronouns, however only the expressions based on the verb of possession \textit{t\v{h}\'awa} plus the definite article. This could be interpreted as a nominalized possessive predication; cf. \REF{lakotatookmine}.\footnote{One of the reviewers mentioned that \textit{mit\v{h}áwa kį he} could be analyzed as a null head relative clause. This is probably the best way to treat it. It does not, however, change the argument here. The example only demonstrates that a nominal expression for the possessed is not required in this possessive construction.}

\glt `She came and took mine'
\z

Interestingly, this is a PC in which there is no possessed noun. All other PCs discussed so far require a possessed lexical noun.
 
\subsection{Osage}\label{sec:helmbrecht:4.5} \label{osage}

Osage is taken as a representative of the Dhegiha sub-branch of Mississippi Valley Siouan. It was chosen because there is a recent extensive grammatical description of this language (\citealt{Quintero2004}). Unfortunately, it is difficult to find the relevant data out of Quintero's grammar of Osage. There is no specific chapter on possession, and there is no index in the grammar. Quintero uses the terms alienable and inalienable, but it is not made explicit which nouns are alienable and which are inalienable. However, some conclusions about this question can be drawn from the numerous examples provided by the grammar.
There is a special construction for PCs with possessed kinship nouns. Kinship nouns are inflected with a series of inalienable pronominal prefixes, cf. \tabref{osageinalienable}.

\begin{table}
\caption{Inalienable possessive prefixes for kinship terms in Osage (\citealt[481]{Quintero2004}f)} \label{osageinalienable}
\begin{tabular}{ l l l l }
\lsptoprule
Possessor	 & inalienable & example & translation \\
& prefix paradigm & & \\
\midrule
\textsc{1sg} & wi-	& wi-sǫ́ka & `my (male's) younger brother' \\
 
\textsc{2sg} & ði- & ði-sǫ́ka & `your (male's) younger brother' \\

\textsc{2pl} & ? & ? & \\
 
\textsc{3pl} & ? & ? & \\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
 
The question marks in \tabref{osageinalienable} indicate that Quintero did not provide the expected forms. In addition, PCs with possessed body part nouns are not provided either.

Alienable nouns require another construction, which has the following properties. There is a pronominally inflected (bound) stem \textit{-hta}, which marks possession.\footnote{Again, this is the Common Siouan marker for alienable possession (cf. \citealt{RankinEtAl2015AccessMay}).} The pronominal prefixes resemble the ones used for the PCs with possessed kinship terms, with one exception. There is a dual and plural form for the first person, which does not exist in the PCs with possessed kinship terms. The inflected possessive form follows the possessed noun; cf. the examples in \REF{osagegroceries} and \REF{osagemaryandjohn}. The full paradigm is given in \tabref{osagealienableposs}.

\ea	Osage (\citealt[298]{Quintero2004}) \label{osagegroceries}

\textsc{1sg} & hcí  'house'	& wihta ? (<wi-hta) & `my house' \\

\textsc{3pl} & hcí  'house' & ihta-api (<i-hta-api) & `their house' \\
\lspbottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Quintero analyzes the possessive form \textit{-hta} as a noun or nominal element for two reasons: first, this stem is inflected by the same prefixes as the inalienable nouns (kinship terms), and secondly, if it would be analyzed as a verbal stem, the possessive inflection would be quite irregular (cf. \citealt[317]{Quintero2004}f). 

One problem with this reasoning is that one would have to expect that the nominal stem \textit{-hta} belongs to the group of inalienable nouns because it requires the inalienable series of prefixes. There is, however, no evidence for that. Secondly, the order of elements suggests that the \textit{-hta} stem is of verbal origin. If it would be nominal, it should precede the possessed noun. Attributive nouns always precede the head nouns; all other modifying elements follow the head noun. That the pronominal prefixes are different from the ones for stative/inactive verbs is not necessarily an argument for the non-verbal character of the stem --- there are often deviations in possessive paradigms. Furthermore, this possessive form may be used autonomously without a possessed noun, cf. the example in \REF{osagebroken}. This construction is not possible in Hoocąk. The utterance in \REF{osagebroken} would require the reflexive possessive prefix \textit{k-/kara-} in Hoocąk.

\ea	Osage (\citealt[413]{Quintero2004}) \label{osagebroken}

\gll ąkóhta     akxa     Ø-xǫ́-api-ðe \\
\textsc{1pl.poss} \textsc{sbj} \textsc{3sg.sbj}-break-\textsc{pl-decl} \\
\glt `Ours is broken'
\z 

Part-whole relationships - at least with regard to inanimate parts - seem to be expressed by means of a simple juxtaposition. However, I found only one example illustrating this in Quintero's grammar, cf. example \REF{osagegarage}.

\ea	Osage (\citealt[423]{Quintero2004}) \label{osagegarage}

\gll oðíhtą hci      hcíže áðiitą-a \\
car       house door close-\textsc{imp} \\
\glt `Close the garage door!'
\z

To summarize: there is an alienable/inalienable distinction in Osage and it seems that kinship terms belong to the inalienable set of nouns (set\textsubscript{1}), while all other nouns belong to the alienable set of noun (set\textsubscript{2}); cf. \tabref{osagealienability}.

\subsection{Biloxi}\label{sec:helmbrecht:4.6}\label{biloxi}
Biloxi was chosen as a representative of the Ohio Valley sub-branch of Siouan. The standard reference work with respect to a grammatical description is \citet{Einaudi1976}. She mentions two NP internal PC types in her grammar of Biloxi, a) a juxtaposition of two nominals to be used for all kinds of possessed nouns, and b) pronominally inflected nouns designating body parts and kinship relations (cf. \citealt[57--68]{Einaudi1976}). Concerning a) the order of nouns in the juxtaposition PC is possessor precedes possessed. Concerning b) if body parts and kinship terms are possessed, the possessed nouns have to be inflected obligatorily with pronominal prefixes that are identical to the ones in verbs. This holds also for some intimate personal possessions such as `house', `clothing', etc. See two examples for the juxtaposed PC construction in \REF{biloxihouse} and two examples of the inflected PC construction in \REF{biloxiuncle}.

\section{Conclusions}
There is an alienable-inalienable distinction in one way or other in all Siouan languages, even in Biloxi, as seen in \tabref{biloxialienability}, but there, the inalienable nouns (kinship, body parts) are inflected by means of the subject prefixes. As the examination of PCs in the various Siouan languages shows, there are at least four kinds of constructions that are used to express possession on the NP level. The simplest construction is  juxtaposition, which is used in all sample languages except for Hidatsa, for which no data were available. Inalienable possession is expressed in all sample languages with a series of possessive affixes directly attached to the possessed. The sole exception is Hoocąk, which has no possessive affixes. There are two principal constructions that express alienable possession in the sample Siouan languages. There is a construction that has a possessive marker attached to the stem indicating alienable possession. The same set of possessive affixes appears with these constructions. This construction is not available in Hoocąk and Biloxi. The second construction utilizes a verb of possession that is nominalized by a determiner and inflected by the same paradigm of possessive affixes. It follows the possessed noun. This construction is missing in Missouri Valley Siouan and in Biloxi. I have no clear data for Osage. The principle types of constructions that are used in Siouan languages to express possession are summarized in \tabref{siouandistribution} together with the semantic kinds of possessed nouns.

The nominalized verbs of possession appear only in Mississippi Valley Siouan, most prominently in Hoocąk. Hoocąk is particular also with regard to the lack of the two middle construction types in Table 20; one could perhaps say that Hoocąk has not really grammaticalized a NP-internal possessive construction:  juxtaposition is semantically the most abstract means, hence able to subsume all kinds of binary relations (among them also real ownership) and the verbal expression of possession is semantically the most concrete one, hence excluding many binary relations that are often expressed by means of possessive constructions (there is no possibility to express association, whole-part, attribution of property relations with these PCs).

Another interesting observation is that there is no neat classification of nouns with respect to the alienable/inalienable distinction. Alienable and inalienable nouns are distributed over all kinds of PCs and it seems that the often observed markedness relations between alienable and inalienable PCs do not really hold in Siouan. For instance, juxtapositions as the least marked PCs comprise real ownership (Lakota, Biloxi) as well as body parts (Mandan, Hoocąk) and kinship terms (Hoocąk). On the other hand, nominalized predicative PCs, which are the most complex PCs in this study, include not only real ownership (Lakota, Hoocąk) but also kinship terms which are inalienable nouns. The two construction types in the middle columns in Table 20 show a markedness relation between inalienable and alienable nouns that is much clearer. The PC with the possessive pronouns attached to the possessed nouns (second column from left) are chosen primarily for inalienable possession (all languages except Hoocąk) and the PC with the added possession marker (\textsc{POSS}) are used overwhelmingly for alienable possession such as real ownership or as a kind of rest category that always includes alienable nouns (all languages except Hoocąk). In Lakota and Mandan, however, kinship terms as possessed nouns are included, which blurs this distinction to some degree.
