This structure captures the differences between \isi{subject}s and \isi{object}s with respect to locative scope\is{scope, locative}, quantifier scope\is{scope, quantifier}, \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}verb-phrase ellipsis, and \isi{resultative}s.

\section{Introduction}

 
Since at least \citealt{Williamson1984}, there has been a debate over the \isi{configurationality} of Siouan languages \citep{Boyle2007,Graczyk1991a,West2003,VanValin1985,VanValin1987}.  The purpose of this paper is to weigh in on this issue with evidence (based on original fieldwork) from \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. By providing novel data from locative scope\is{scope, locative}, quantifier scope\is{scope, quantifier}, \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}verb-phrase ellipsis, and \isi{resultative}s, we argue that \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk has a verb phrase (\is{verb phrase}VP). This adds empirical support for previous studies that have argued that Siouan languages have a verb phrase (e.g., \citealt{Boyle2007}; \citealt{Graczyk1991a}; \citealt{West2003}).

	The crucial observation that we make is in this paper is that there exist a number of \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries. To account for these data, we propose a \isi{syntax} for \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk that consists minimally of the structure shown in \REF{ex:jrs:1}.
 

\ea\label{ex:jrs:1}
\Tree [ .\isi{XP} [ .Subject ] [ .\is{verb phrase}VP [ .Object ] [ .Verb ] ] ]
\z

By contrast, we argue that a flat, \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational structure such as the one in \REF{ex:jrs:2} cannot adequately account for the data (cf.  \citealt{VanValin1985,VanValin1987,Williamson1984}).

\ea\label{ex:jrs:2}

This paper is organized as follows. In \sectref{sec:jrs:2}, we outline previous analyses that argue in favor of a \isi{flat structure} for various Siouan languages, and then discuss how the \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk data compare. \sectref{sec:jrs:3} reviews arguments for a \is{verb phrase}VP in other Siouan languages, and shows that similar arguments can be made for \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. In \sectref{sec:jrs:4}, we provide four new arguments in favor a of \is{verb phrase}VP analysis of \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. \sectref{sec:jrs:5} concludes the paper.
 


\section{Arguments in favor of a \isi{flat structure}}\label{sec:jrs:2}

 
In this section, we provide background on the nature of \isi{configurationality} in the context of \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk (and other Siouan languages). \sectref{sec:jrs:2.1} outlines the previous nonconfigurational accounts (\citealt{Hale1983} and \citealt{Jelinek1984}) that stand in contrast to the configurational account that we propose in this paper. In \sectref{sec:jrs:2.2}, we review the previous arguments for a flat \is{verb phrase}VP structure in Siouan languages. Then in \sectref{sec:jrs:2.3}, we show that \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk displays all three of the prototypical characteristics of being a nonconfigurational language.
 

\subsection{Non\isi{configurationality} and pronominal arguments\is{Pronominal Argument Hypothesis}:  Hale (1983) and Jelinek (1984)}\label{sec:jrs:2.1}

Since \citet{Hale1983}, \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational languages have been typologically\is{typology} characterized by the three traits given in \REF{ex:jrs:3}:

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:3} Properties of \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational languages

	i.	Free \isi{word order}

	ii.	Extensive null anaphora

	iii.	Presence of discontinuous constituents
\end{exe}

Hale's approach makes use of two levels of representation: \textit{lexical structure} (LS) and \textit{phrase structure} (PS). Hale argues that all languages are configurational at LS; that is, the \isi{subject} asymmetrically c-commands the \isi{object}. However, this asymmetry is not realized at the level of PS in nonconfigurational languages: the phrase structure is flat. This is the definition of \isi{configurationality} that is most adopted by Siouanists. For example, \citet{Boyle2007} claims that \ili{Hidatsa} is a configurational language on the grounds that there are \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries that are indicative of a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent. (See also  \citealt{VanValin1985,VanValin1987,Williamson1984}, and \citealt{West2003}.) 

	Another formal account of non\isi{configurationality} is \citegen{Jelinek1984} \textit{\isi{Pronominal Argument Hypothesis}} (PAH). According to the \isi{PAH}, person markers are the actual arguments of the verb, while the overt NPs are adjuncts adjoined high in the \is{clauses}clause, as in \REF{ex:jrs:4}. We use ``TP'' (Tense Phrase) for the phrase that represents the sentence level.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:4} 
\Tree [ .TP [ .NP\textsubscript{i} \edge[roof]; {\textit{subject}} ] [ .TP [ .NP\textsubscript{j} \edge[roof]; {\textit{object}} ] [ .Verb [ . Agreement ] [ .Verb ] ] ] ]
\end{exe}

The overt NPs, when present, are coindexed with the person markers. Since adjuncts are known to have freer distribution of \isi{word order} than arguments, the ``free'' \isi{word order} in \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational languages is accounted for. Adjuncts are also never obligatory, explaining the possibility of \textit{pro}-drop of all NPs in nonconfigurational langugages. Lastly, this proposal accounts for the presence of apparent discontinuous constituents in nonconfigurational languages. Jelinek proposes that more than one \isi{adjunct} NP can be coindexed with a given person marker. Thus, what appear to be discontinuous NPs are actually two separate NPs that correspond to the same argument.

 In contrast, a \is{configurationality}configurational language is one that that does show \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries and has a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent, as depicted in \REF{ex:jrs:5} below.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:5} 
\Tree [ .TP [ .T ] [ .vP [ .NP \edge[roof]; {\textit{subject}} ] [ .\is{verb phrase}VP [ .NP \edge[roof]; {\textit{object}} ] [ .Verb ] ] ] ]
\end{exe}

Example \REF{ex:jrs:5} shows that the \isi{subject} and \isi{object} are not in \isi{adjunct} positions: they do not adjoin to the TP (or Sentence). Following \citet{Chomsky1995}, we assume that the \isi{subject} is base-generated in a position outside of the \is{verb phrase}VP, which we label ``vP.'' The \isi{object} merges as an argument of the verb inside the \is{verb phrase}VP. Thus, by ``\is{verb phrase}VP'' we refer to the constituent that contains the \isi{object}, the verb, and perhaps other modifier material. Crucially, the \isi{subject} is not considered part of the \is{verb phrase}VP.
 
\subsection{Previous analyses: Williamson (1984), Van Valin (1985, 1987)}\label{sec:jrs:2.2} 

\renewcommand{\exfont}{\upshape}

In this section, we discuss arguments in favor of a \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational analysis of Siouan languages that have been put forth in previous works.
	
\citet{Williamson1984} argues that \ili{Lakota} is \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational because it lacks the \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries traditionally associated with the Empty Category Principle (ECP).  Long distance \textit{wh}-extraction of the \isi{subject} over an overt complementizer is possible in \ili{Lakota}; that is, the language does not display \textit{that}-trace effects. Long distance extraction out of \textit{wh}-islands from \isi{subject} position is also allowed in \ili{Lakota}.  Examples \REF{ex:jrs:6}--\REF{ex:jrs:8} below illustrate these facts:

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:6} \gll Mary		tuwa		wąyąke	\textbf{ki}			ilukcha 		he? \\
Mary 	who		see 			\textsc{comp}		you.think	\textsc{q} \\
\trans `Who do you think that Mary saw?' (\citealt[281]{Williamson1984}, (64a))
\ex\label{ex:jrs:7} \gll Tuwa		hel			na\v{z}\k{i} 		he		\textbf{ki}			ilukcha 		he? \\
who		there		stand		\textsc{dur} 	\textsc{comp}		you-think	\textsc{q} \\
\trans `Who do you think that was standing there?' (\citealt[281]{Williamson1984}, (65a))
\ex\label{ex:jrs:8} \gll	Tohą		tuwa	u				pi	\textbf{ki} 			slolyaya		he? \\
when		who	come		\textsc{pl} 	\textsc{comp} 	you.know \textsc{q} \\
\trans `Who do you know when is coming?' (\citealt[281]{Williamson1984}, (66a))
\end{exe} 

In a language with \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries, long-distance \textit{wh}-extraction of the \isi{subject} should not be possible, as doing so would constitute a violation of the ECP (as evidenced by the ungrammaticality of the \ili{English} translations in \REF{ex:jrs:7}-\REF{ex:jrs:8}).  Because \ili{Lakota} appears to allow long-distance \textit{wh}-extraction from \isi{subject} position, Williamson argues that the language has no \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetry and thus lacks a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent.

\citet{VanValin1985,VanValin1987} also argues for a \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational analysis of \ili{Lakota} on the basis of the lack of Weak Crossover and Binding\is{binding} Condition C effects.  First, let us consider the diagnostic from Weak Crossover (WCO). A WCO violation occurs when a pronoun is coreferential with the \textit{wh}-trace in \isi{subject} or \isi{object} position and neither one c-commands the other (\citealt{Sportiche1985}).  \REF{ex:jrs:9} illustrates an \ili{English} example of WCO: the \textit{wh}-word \textit{who} undergoes movement from an \isi{object} position (represented by a trace, ``t'') to the left edge of the \is{clauses}clause. \textit{Who} must ``cross over'' the co-indexed pronoun \textit{his}. Since \textit{who} and \textit{his} cannot refer to the same person, the sentence is ungrammatical. 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:9}  *Who\textsubscript{i} does his\textsubscript{i} mother love t\textsubscript{i}?
\end{exe}

Thus in a language with a \is{verb phrase}VP node, a coreferential reading between the \textit{wh}-word and \isi{possessive pronoun} in the sentence in \REF{ex:jrs:10} below would be expected to be unavailable.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:10} \gll $\varnothing$-tha-kh\'ola-ku 	ki	tuwá	wąy\k{á}ka	he? \\
3-\textsc{poss}-friend-\textsc{poss} the who		\textsc{3sg}.see.\textsc{3sg} 	\textsc{q} \\
\trans `Who\textsubscript{i} did his\textsubscript{i}  friend see?' (\citealt[379]{VanValin1987})
\end{exe}

Because the construction in \REF{ex:jrs:9} does not cause a WCO violation in \ili{Lakota}, Van Valin argues that no \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetry exists in the language, and thus it does not possess a \is{verb phrase}VP.
	
Van Valin additionally cites the lack of Binding Condition C (BCC) violations in \ili{Lakota} as evidence that the language lacks a \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetry.  This is due to the fact that \isi{binding} conditions crucially rely on a c-command relationship between anaphors, pronouns and r-expressions.  Van Valin argues that since there appear to be no BCC violations in \ili{Lakota}, the \isi{subject} must not c-command the \isi{object}. This falls out of an analysis where both NPs are attached at the TP (or sentence) level. We return to BCC violations in the next section.

 
\subsection{Hocąk data}\label{sec:jrs:2.3}

\citet{Hale1983} and \citet{Jelinek1984} identify three properties that they claim are common to all nonconfigurational languages: free \isi{word order}, extensive null anaphora, and discontinuous constituents. Below, we show that \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk does display each of the three classic signs of non\isi{configurationality} put forth by Hale and Jelinek, as well as a number of additional characteristics of nonconfigurational languages proposed by \citet{Baker1996}.  

First, NP arguments may appear in a variety of orders.  This is expected in an analysis under which there is a \isi{flat structure} and all NPs are adjuncts adjoined at the TP (or sentence) level. SOV \isi{word order} is the most common in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk, as in \REF{ex:jrs:11}. Any variation in \isi{word order} has discourse-informational effects, as hinted at by the \ili{English} translations given in the examples below. As shown in \REF{ex:jrs:12a}, a participant displaced to the left serves a \isi{topic} or focus\is{information structure} function, whereas participants displaced to the right\is{postverbal arguments} are interpreted as anti-\isi{topic}s (e.g., ``backgrounded'' or discourse-old), as shown in \REF{ex:jrs:12b}--\REF{ex:jrs:12e}.

\textsc{3s/o}-buy lady-\textsc{def} car-\textsc{def} \\
\trans `Someone bought something, (it was) the lady, the car.'
\z
\z

It is also possible for NP arguments to have freedom of placement among each other. The default order of arguments in a ditransitive construction is Agent > Indirect Object > Direct Object; however, their order can vary.  This is shown below in \REF{ex:jrs:13}, where the \isi{subject} NP \textit{hin\k{u}khi\v{z}ą} `a woman' can appear in several different positions.

\ea\label{ex:jrs:13}
\glll (Hin\k{u}khi\v{z}ą,) 	hoc\k{i}c\k{i}hi\v{z}ą 	(hin\k{u}khi\v{z}ą,) wiiwagaxhi\v{z}ą 	(hin\k{u}khi\v{z}ą,) hok'\k{u}.\\
hin\k{u}k-hi\v{z}ą 		hoc\k{i}c\k{i}-hi\v{z}ą 	hin\k{u}k-hi\v{z}ą 		wiiwagax-hi\v{z}ą 	hin\k{u}k-hi\v{z}ą 	$\varnothing$-hok\k{u}\\
	woman-\textsc{indef}	boy-\textsc{indef} 	woman-\textsc{indef} 	pencil-\textsc{indef} 	woman-\textsc{indef} 	\textsc{3s/o}-give\\
\trans `A woman gave a boy a pencil.'
\z
	
Second, NPs corresponding to arguments can be freely omitted in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. Examples of this are shown below in \REF{ex:jrs:14}, where the agent and patient/the\-me arguments are omitted:

\ea\label{ex:jrs:14}
\ea \label{ex:jrs:14a} 
\glll Wij\k{u}kra	\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}kra		hoxataprookeeja 		haja.\\
wij\k{u}k-ra	\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k-ra	hoxatap-rook-eeja 	$\varnothing$-haja \\
	cat-\textsc{def} 	dog-\textsc{def} 	woods-inside-there 	\textsc{3s/o}-see \\
\trans `The cat saw the dog in the woods.'

\ex \label{ex:jrs:14b}
\glll Hoxataprookeeja haja. \\
hoxatap-rook-eeja 	$\varnothing$-haja \\
woods-inside-there \textsc{3s/o}-see \\
\trans `It (the cat) saw it (the dog) in the woods.'
\z 
\z 

Sentence \REF{ex:jrs:14b} is grammatical and can (under the right \isi{discourse} context) have the equivalent meaning to \REF{ex:jrs:14a}; however, it is missing the agent and patient/the\-me NPs \textit{wij\k{u}kra} and \textit{\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}kra}. This is also expected under  \citegen{Hale1983}, \citegen{Jelinek1984}, and \citegen{Baker1996} analyses: NPs have \isi{adjunct} status and thus are not obligatory.

\il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk also displays discontinuous constituents. Demonstratives and quantifiers may be separated from the head noun, as shown in \REF{ex:jrs:15} with \textit{\v{z}e'e} `that': 

\ea\label{ex:jrs:15}
\ea \label{ex:jrs:15a}
\glll Wijukra	\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k	\v{z}e'e	haja. \\
wijuk-ra	\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k	\v{z}e'e	$\varnothing$-haja \\
	cat-\textsc{def} 	dog	that		\textsc{3s/o}-see\\
\trans `The cat saw that dog.' 

\ex \label{ex:jrs:15b}
\glll \v{Z}e'e	wijukra	 \v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k	haja. \\
\v{z}e'e	wijuk-ra	\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k	$\varnothing$-haja \\
that cat-D\textsc{def} dog \textsc{3s/o}-see \\
\trans `The cat saw that dog.'
\z 
\z 

Discontinuous constituents are expected under the analyses of nonconfigurationality by \citet{Hale1983} and \citet{Jelinek1984}, due to the fact that NPs have the status of adjuncts. Hale and Jelinek propose that multiple adjuncts can be associated with the same argument in a given sentence. Thus, the demonstrative and head noun in \REF{ex:jrs:15b} are actually two separate NPs that both correspond to the \isi{object}.

In addition to \citegen{Hale1983} classic characteristics of non\isi{configurationality}, \il{Ho-Chunk}Ho\-cąk displays four additional traits of nonconfigurational languages discussed by \citet{Baker1996}. First, \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk does not display BCC effects within \isi{clauses}.  As discussed in the previous section, this lack of BCC effects is expected when there is no asymmetry between the \isi{subject} and the \isi{object} In \REF{ex:jrs:16} below, coreference between the \isi{subject} `he' and the \isi{possessor} `Bryan' is grammatical.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:16}	
\glll (Ee) 	Bryanga 			hi'\k{u}ni 	hiira 				homąk\k{i}n\k{i}. \\
Ee 		Bryan-ga 		hi'\k{u}ni 	hii-ra 			$\varnothing$-homąk\k{i}n\k{i} \\
he 		Bryan-\textsc{prop} mother 	\textsc{poss-def} 	\textsc{3s/o}-visit  \\
\trans `He\textsubscript{i} visited Bryan\textsubscript{i}'s mom.'
\end{exe}
 
However, as Baker shows to be true in other \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational languages, \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk does display BCC effects across \isi{clauses}. In \REF{ex:jrs:17}, coreference between the matrix \isi{subject} `she' and the embedded \isi{object} `Meredith' is impossible.
 
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:17}	
\glll (Ee) 	Hunterga 	Meredithga		hajara 						hiraperes\v{s}ąną. \\
 Ee 		Hunter-ga 	Meredith-ga 		$\varnothing$-haja-ra 				$\varnothing$-hiraperes-\v{s}ąną \\
she 		Hunter-\textsc{prop} 	Meredith-\textsc{prop} 	\textsc{3s/o}-see-\textsc{comp} 	\textsc{3s}-know-\textsc{decl}  \\
\trans `She\textsubscript{*i/j} knows that Hunter saw Meredith\textsubscript{i}.'
\end{exe}	

 
Second, \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk lacks NP anaphors, which are also argued by \citet{Baker1996} to be nonexistent in \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational languages. Instead, reflexive and reciprocal meanings are expressed morphologically on the verb, as seen in \REF{ex:jrs:18}:
 
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:18} 
\glll Meredithga		anąga 	Hunterga 			hokikij\k{i}ire.\\
Meredith-ga	 	anąga 	Hunter-ga 			<kiki>hoj\k{i}-ire \\
Meredith-\textsc{prop} and 		Hunter-\textsc{prop} 	<\textsc{refl}>hit-\textsc{3s.pl} \\
\trans `Meredith and Hunter hit each other.'
\end{exe}
	
 
Third, according to \citet{Baker1996}, \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational languages should lack both universal quantifiers that are grammatically singular and negative\is{negation} quantifiers. \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk does not have a universal quantifier that is grammatically singular.  In \REF{ex:jrs:19} below, both \textit{hanąąc} `all/every' and \textit{hi\v{z}ąki\v{s}ąną} `each' trigger plural agreement on the verb.
 
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:19}	
\begin{xlist}	
\ex
\glll Bryanga {waisgap sguu xuwuxuwura} 	hanąą 	waruuc\v{s}ąną.\\
Bryan-ga 	{waisgap sguu xuwuxuwu-ra} 	hanąą 	wa-$\varnothing$-ruuc-\v{s}ąną \\
	Bryan-\textsc{prop} 	cookie-\textsc{def}	all 		\textsc{3o.pl-3s}-eat-\textsc{decl} \\
\trans `Bryan ate every cookie/all of the cookies.'

\ex 
\glll Hoc\k{i}c\k{i}ra 	hi\v{z}ąki\v{s}ąną 	{waisgap sguu xuwuxuwuhi\v{z}ą }		ruucire.\\
hoc\k{i}c\k{i}-ra 	hi\v{z}ąki\v{s}ąną 	{waisgap sguu xuwuxuwu-hi\v{z}ą }		ruuc-ire \\
	boy-\textsc{def} 		each 					cookie-\textsc{indef}		eat-\textsc{3s.pl}\\
\trans `Each boy ate a cookie.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

 
\il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk also does not possess negative\is{negation} quantifiers: instead, the equivalents to `nothing' and `nobody' are expressed through a combination of clausal \isi{negation} and indefinite pronouns. This is shown in (\ref{ex:jrs:20}a) and (\ref{ex:jrs:20}b), respectively.

Finally, \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk lacks WCO effects. In \REF{ex:jrs:21} below, a coreferential reading between the \isi{possessive pronoun} and the \isi{object} \textit{wh}-word is grammatical.

Recall from the previous subsection that \citet{VanValin1985,VanValin1987} uses the lack of BCC and WCO effects in \ili{Lakota} to argue for a \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational \isi{syntax}. While \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk also lacks BCC and WCO effects, we argue that this does not constitute conclusive evidence of the lack of a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent in the language. In the remainder of the paper, we provide other arguments that strongly favor a \is{verb phrase}VP analysis for \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. We leave an explanation for the lack of BCC and WCO effects in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk for future research.
 
\section{Arguments in favor of a VP}\label{sec:jrs:3}

\subsection{Previous analyses: Boyle (2007), Graczyk (1991), West (2003)}

In the previous section, we presented arguments in favor of a \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational, VP-less analysis in several Siouan languages.  In this section, we present arguments in favor of a configurational analysis of Siouan languages (that is, arguments in favor of a \is{verb phrase}VP analysis).  The first piece of evidence comes from \isi{word order} restrictions. Recall that one of \citegen{Hale1983} and \citegen{Jelinek1984} typifying characteristics of nonconfigurational languages is free \isi{word order}.  Across Siouan languages, neutral \isi{word order} is SOV.  Several Siouanists have argued that other word orders have discourse-informational effects, and thus that \isi{word order} is not actually free in these languages. For example, \citet{West2003} shows that in \ili{Assiniboine} sentences with OSV \isi{word order}, the fronted \isi{object} has a preferred focus reading; otherwise, the first argument is interpreted as the \isi{subject}. This is shown below in \REF{ex:jrs:22}. 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:22}	\gll  \v{S}k\'o\v{s}obena wã\v{z}í 	hok\v{s}ína 	\v{z}e 		y\'uda. \\
banana 		a 			boy 	\textsc{det} 	ate \\
\trans `The boy ate a banana (not the apple).' (preferred translation) or 

`A banana ate the boy'  \citep[49]{West2003} 
\end{exe}

The same is true of \ili{Hidatsa}.  \citet{Boyle2007} shows that unmarked \isi{word order} is SOV, with exceptions occurring in \isi{topic}alization or focus constructions.  This is shown below in \REF{ex:jrs:23} with neutral SOV \isi{word order} and \REF{ex:jrs:24} OSV order:

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:23} 
\glll Buushígesh wash\'ugash éegaac.\\
puu\v{s}íhke-\v{s}  ma\v{s}\'uka-\v{s} éekaa-c \\
cat-\textsc{det.d} dog-\textsc{det.d} see-\textsc{decl}  \\
\trans `The cat sees the dog.'  \citep[214]{Boyle2007}

\ex\label{ex:jrs:24} 
\glll Mas\'ugash 		buushígesh 	éegaac.\\
mas\'uka-\v{s} 		puusíhke-\v{s} 	ékaa-c \\
dog-\textsc{det.d} 		cat-\textsc{det.d}\textsc{det}	see-\textsc{decl} \\
\trans `The cat sees the dog.' \citep[214]{Boyle2007}

\end{exe}
	
\citet{Graczyk1991a} observes that SOV is neutral \isi{word order} for \il{Apsaalooke}Crow as well, and that other word orders have discourse-informational effects.  This is shown below, where \REF{ex:jrs:25} has neutral \isi{word order}, and \REF{ex:jrs:26} has OVS \isi{word order}:

\let\eachwordtwo=\upshape

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:25} \gll Shikáak-kaatee-sh ashé 		hii-ák. \\
boy-\textsc{dimin-det} 		home 	reach-\textsc{ss} \\
\trans `The little boy reached home.' \citep[101]{Graczyk1991a}

\ex\label{ex:jrs:26} \gll Iaxp-\'uua 		ítchi-kiss-uua-sh			kootáa 	híi-k 	hinne		talée-sh. \\
their.feather-\textsc{pl} good-sport-\textsc{pl}-\textsc{det}		entirely 	reach-\textsc{decl}	this 	oil-\textsc{det} \\
\trans `It entirely covered their beautiful feathers, this oil.' \citep[103]{Graczyk1991a}
\end{exe}


In \REF{ex:jrs:26}, OSV \isi{word order} is used to deemphasize the discourse-old \isi{subject} \textit{talee} `oil', and emphasize the \isi{object} \textit{iaxp} `their feather'.  Based on these \isi{word order} restrictions, West, Boyle and Graczyk all argue that \ili{Assiniboine}, \ili{Hidatsa} and \il{Apsaalooke}Crow are \is{configurationality}configurational. 
	
The second piece of evidence that has been previously used to show the presence of a \is{verb phrase}VP in Siouan languages comes from enclitics. \citet{West2003} and \citet{Boyle2007} use the scope of enclitics to argue for a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent. \citet{Boyle2007} demonstrates that the \ili{Hidatsa} habitual enclitic \textit{-ʔii} takes scope over both verbs in the example in \REF{ex:jrs:27} below:


\let\eachwordtwo=\itshape
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:27} 
\glll Doosha	wiriʔéeraga 	adáʔa 	 k\textsuperscript{h}\'uuiidoog?\\
too\v{s}\textsuperscript{h}a 	wiri-éeraka 	atá-a k\textsuperscript{h}\'uu-ʔii-took \\
how 	sun-\textsc{dem} 	appear-\textsc{cont}  come.up-\textsc{hab.sg.spec} \\
\trans `How does the Sun always appear and come up? (he wondered)' \citep[223]{Boyle2007}
\end{exe}

The situation is the same in \ili{Assiniboine}.  In \REF{ex:jrs:28} below, the aspectual clitic \textit{s'a} scopes over both verbs, not just to the one to which it is attached:

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:28} \gll Wiy\'{ã}-bi 		\v{z}é-na 	woy\'uta 	spãy\'{ã}-bi 	hikná 	hayábi 		ga\v{g}é\v{g}e-bi 	s'a. \\
woman-\textsc{pl} the-\textsc{pl} 	food 	cook-\textsc{pl} \textsc{conj} 	clothes 	sew-\textsc{pl} 	\textsc{hab} \\
\trans `The women usually cooked the food and sewed the clothes.' \citep[39]{West2003}
\end{exe}

The sentence in \REF{ex:jrs:28} cannot mean `the women cooked the food and usually sewed the clothes' (\citealt{West2003}).  If \ili{Assiniboine} had no \is{verb phrase}VP, this reading should not be possible: the clitic should only be able to scope over the verb it is attached to. Both \citet{Boyle2007} and \citet{West2003} argue that the clitics head a functional projection that c-commands the coordinated\is{coordination} elements, which are VPs.  Thus, enclitic scope provides evidence in support of the existence of a \is{verb phrase}VP in \ili{Hidatsa} and \ili{Assiniboine}.
	
It has been argued for other Siouan languages (\citealt{Boyle2007}, \citealt{West2003}) that \isi{coordination} itself targets VPs, since \isi{coordination} can target a constituent that includes the \isi{object} and verb. In contrast, \isi{coordination} can never target the \isi{subject} and verb to the exclusion of the \isi{object}.  \citet{Boyle2007} shows that in \ili{Hidatsa}, the \isi{subject} of the second \is{clauses}clause must be the same as the \isi{subject} of the first clause in \REF{ex:jrs:29}:

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:29} 
\glll Alex wía ikáaa réec.\\
Alex wía ikáa-a rée-c \\
Alex woman see-\textsc{cont} leave-\textsc{decl} \\
\trans `Alex saw the woman and (Alex/*the woman) left.' \citep[217]{Boyle2007} 
\end{exe}

\citet{West2003} provides similar data from \ili{Assiniboine} to support a \is{configurationality}configurational analysis, as shown in \REF{ex:jrs:30} below:


\let\eachwordtwo=\upshape
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:30} \gll Wíyã 	 \v{z}e 		{\ob}wicá 	\v{s}e 	wayága{\cb}  hĩkná 	{\ob}céya{\cb}. \\
woman 	\textsc{det} 	{\db}man 		the see 				\textsc{conj} 		{\db}cry \\
\trans `The woman saw the man and cried.'

*`The woman saw the man and he cried' \citep[34]{West2003}
\end{exe}

As in \ili{Hidatsa}, the \isi{subject} of the second conjoined verb \textit{céya} `cry' in \REF{ex:jrs:30} can only be \textit{wíyã} `the woman'.  In a \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational language, either NP should be able to be the \isi{subject} of the second verb; thus Boyle and West argue that \ili{Hidatsa} and \ili{Assiniboine} are configurational and have a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent.

 
\subsection{Hocąk data}

In the previous subsection, we presented previous arguments for a \is{configurationality}configurational analysis of several Siouan languages.  In this section, we show that the tests used by \citet{Boyle2007} for \ili{Hidatsa}, \citet{Graczyk1991a} for \il{Apsaalooke}Crow, and \citet{West2003} for \ili{Assiniboine} yield the same results when applied to \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.
	
First, \isi{word order} is crucial to disambiguate \isi{subject}s and \isi{object}s in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.  In \REF{ex:jrs:31} below, the first argument is interpreted as the \isi{subject}:
 
\let\eachwordtwo=\itshape

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:31} 
\glll Wijukra	\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}kra 		haja.\\
wijuk-ra 		\v{s}\k{u}\k{u}k-ra 		$\varnothing$-haja \\
cat-\textsc{def} 		dog-\textsc{def} 	\textsc{3s/o}-see \\
\trans `The cat saw the dog.'

$\neq$ `The dog saw the cat.'
\end{exe}

A reading in which the dog saw the cat is also possible for \REF{ex:jrs:31}, but only when the first argument is followed by an \isi{intonation}al pause.
	
 
As shown in the previous section, \citet{Boyle2007} and \citet{West2003} provided evidence from enclitic scope to show that \ili{Hidatsa} and \ili{Assiniboine} have a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent.  The same proves true in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.  In \REF{ex:jrs:32}-\REF{ex:jrs:34} below, the enclitics \textit{g\k{i}n\k{i}} `already', \textit{ege} `might' and \textit{\v{z}ee\v{z}i} `hopefully' take scope over both coordinated\is{coordination} verbs in the (b) examples, even though they are only attached to the second verb.

\trans `Hopefully Bryan will buy coffee and give it to me.'
\z
\z
 
If \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk lacked a \is{verb phrase}VP, this pattern would be unexpected: the clitics should only be able to scope over the verb to which they are attached. Instead, the clitics in the (b) examples above take scope over both coordinated\is{coordination} verb phrases. This indicates that the constituent that clitics scope over is a \is{verb phrase}VP, and that these enclitics attach at the \is{verb phrase}VP level. 
	
Lastly, \citet{Boyle2007} and \citet{West2003} showed that \isi{coordination} targets VPs in \ili{Hidatsa} and \ili{Assiniboine}, providing further evidence for a \is{configurationality}configurational analysis of these languages.  Coordination also targets VPs in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk, as shown in \REF{ex:jrs:35} and \REF{ex:jrs:36} below. In these examples, the \isi{subject} of the first conjunct\is{conjunction}, \textit{wąąkwa\v{z}oon\k{i}ra} `the hunter', must also be the \isi{subject} of the second conjunct.  Example \REF{ex:jrs:36} is especially revealing, as the only possible meaning is not as pragmatically plausible: it would (arguably) be more likely for the bear to die in that scenario.
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:35} 
\glll Wąąkwa\v{z}oon\k{i}ra 		hk{u}k{u}ra 			ruxe 				ank{a}ga 	t'eehii. \\
wąąkwa\v{z}oonk{i}-ra 	hk{u}k{u}c-ra 		$\varnothing$-ruxe  		ank{a}ga 	$\varnothing$-t'ee-hii \\

  \ex\label{ex:jrs:36} 
\glll Wąąkwa\v{z}oon\k{i}ra 		h\k{u}\k{u}cra 		guuc 				anąga 	t'ee. \\
wąąkwa\v{z}oon\k{i}-ra 	h\k{u}\k{u}c-ra 		$\varnothing$-guuc 			anąga 	$\varnothing$-t'ee \\
hunter-\textsc{def} 		bear-\textsc{def} 	\textsc{3s/o}-shoot 		and 		\textsc{3s}-die \\
\trans `The hunter shot the bear and [the hunter] died.'
\end{exe}
	
 
If there was no \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetry, either `hunter' or `bear' should be a possible \isi{subject} for the second conjuncts\is{conjunction} in \REF{ex:jrs:35} and \REF{ex:jrs:36}. Thus, these examples show that \isi{coordination} in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk targets a constituent that excludes the \isi{subject}; namely, the \is{verb phrase}VP.
 

\section{New Evidence for a \is{verb phrase}VP in Hocąk}\label{sec:jrs:4}

\subsection{Scope of Locatives}

The first piece of new evidence for a \is{verb phrase}VP involves the interpretation of locative adjuncts. The neutral position of locative adjuncts is shown in \REF{ex:jrs:37} with \textit{hoxataprookeeja} `in the woods' appearing between the \isi{object} and the verb.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:37} 
\glll Wijukra	\v{s}uukra		hoxataprookeeja		haja.\\
wijuk-ra	\v{s}uuk-ra		hoxatap-rook-eeja		$\varnothing$-haja \\
cat-\textsc{def}		dog-\textsc{def} 	woods-inside-there	\textsc{3s/o}-see \\
\trans `The cat saw the dog in the woods.' 
\end{exe}

The translation in \REF{ex:jrs:37} is ambiguous. The \ili{English} sentence has three possible interpretations, as outlined in \REF{ex:jrs:38} below.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:38} 
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{ex:jrs:38a} The cat is in the woods, and it saw the dog. The dog is not in the woods. 
\ex \label{ex:jrs:38b} The dog is in the woods, and the cat saw the dog. The cat is not in the woods.
\ex \label{ex:jrs:38c}Both the cat and the dog are in the woods, and the cat saw the dog.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

 
In \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk, however, only the interpretations in (\ref{ex:jrs:38}b) and (\ref{ex:jrs:38}c) are available for \REF{ex:jrs:37}; that is, the locative \isi{adjunct} must describe the location of the \isi{object}. This is true even if the locative \textit{hoxataprookeeja} `in the woods' is \is{clauses}clause-initial or clause-final, as in (\ref{ex:jrs:39}a) and (\ref{ex:jrs:39}b) , respectively. These sentences cannot have the reading in (\ref{ex:jrs:38}a), where only the dog can be in the woods.
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:39}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\glll Hoxataprookeeja, 		wijukra	\v{s}uukra			haja.\\
hoxatap-rook-eeja		wijuk-ra	\v{s}uuk-ra		$\varnothing$-haja \\
	woods-inside-there 	cat-\textsc{def}		dog-\textsc{def}		\textsc{3s/o}-see \\
\trans `In the woods, the cat saw the dog.'
\ex 
\glll Wijukra	\v{s}uukra			haja,				hoxataprookeeja.\\
wijuk-ra	\v{s}uuk-ra		$\varnothing$-haja			hoxatap-rook-eeja \\
	cat-\textsc{def}		dog-\textsc{def}		\textsc{3s/o}-see	woods-inside-there \\
\trans `The cat saw the dog in the woods.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
	
 
A \is{configurationality}nonconfigurational analysis cannot readily account for this \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetry: if \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk had a \isi{flat structure}, we would not expect the locative to be able to modify only the \isi{object}.
 
	
Alternatively, we argue that the \isi{object} NP is the unique \isi{complement} to the verb. We account for the scope facts by suggesting that the locative phrase can merge in two locations. If the locative adjoins to the \is{verb phrase}VP (that is, the constituent that contains the \isi{object} and the verb) then the reading in (38b) is available: the locative only has scope over the \isi{object}. On the other hand, if the locative adjoins to a position above the \is{verb phrase}VP, then the reading in (38c) is obtained: the locative then scopes over both arguments.

\subsection{Verb-Phrase Ellipsis (\is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE)}

 
As first discussed by \citet{Johnson2013}, \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk displays a process of \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE in which the \isi{light verb} \textit{\k{u}\k{u}} replaces the verb and the \isi{object}, to the exclusion of the \isi{subject} \REF{ex:jrs:40}:
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:40} 
\glll Cecilga	wa\v{z}ątirehi\v{z}ą		ruw\k{i}	kjane		anąga	nee		\v{s}ge		ha\k{u}\k{u}			kjane.\\
Cecil-ga	wa\v{z}ątire-hi\v{z}ą	$\varnothing$-ruw\k{i}		kjane		anąga	nee	\v{s}ge ha-\k{u}\k{u}		kjane \\
Cecil-\textsc{prop}		car-\textsc{indef}			\textsc{3s/o}-buy		\textsc{fut}	and	I	also	\textsc{1s}-do	\textsc{fut} \\
\trans `Cecil will buy a car, and I will too.'
\end{exe}

The examples in \REF{ex:jrs:41} show that \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE also targets certain adjuncts. (41a) shows that \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE targets VPs containing temporal adjuncts. In (41b), a locative \isi{adjunct} is included in the \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}ellipsis site. (41c) exemplifies \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE with a \isi{comitative}. In all of these examples, the \isi{adjunct} in the antecedent \is{verb phrase}VP is interpreted as being present in the \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}ellipsis site, indicating that \textit{\k{u}\k{u}} targets the entire \is{verb phrase}VP rather than just the \isi{object}.

Constructions with \textit{\k{u}\k{u}} cannot be analyzed as a \textit{pro}-form, as \isi{object} extraction is permitted. \REF{ex:jrs:42a} shows that focused elements can be extracted from the \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}ellipsis site. Furthermore, antecedent-contained deletion (ACD) is also possible {ex:jrs:42b}. ACD would not be possible if \textit{\k{u}\k{u}} were a \textit{pro}-form, since the head of the \is{clauses, relative}relative clause is the \isi{object} of the elided verb phrase.

\is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE is also permitted in embedded \isi{clauses} and adjuncts, which is also inconsistent with a \textit{pro}-form analysis. \REF{ex:jrs:43a} exemplifies \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE in an embedded clause, and \REF{ex:jrs:43b}--\REF{ex:jrs:43c} show that \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}ellipsis sites are licit inside \isi{adjunct} \isi{clauses}.

The presence of \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE constitutes strong evidence for a \is{configurationality}configurational analysis of \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk: in a \isi{flat structure}, there is no \is{verb phrase}VP constituent that can be targeted by \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}ellipsis. Since at least \citet{Ross1969}, the presence of \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE in \ili{English} has been used as an argument in favor of a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent that contains the verb and \isi{object} to the exclusion of the \isi{subject}. \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk also displays \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE, which leads us to conclude that \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk must have a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent.
 

\subsection{Quantifier scope}

 
Another piece of evidence in favor of a \is{configurationality}configurational analysis of \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk comes from quantifier scope\is{scope, quantifier}. As discussed in \citet{Johnson2014} and \citet{JohnsonRosen2014}, linear order determines the scope of quantified phrases in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. In a sentence with SOV \isi{word order}, the \isi{subject} obligatorily distributes over the \isi{object}. This is shown below in (44a), where the sentence can only describe a situation in which each man caught a different fish. However, the interpretation changes with SVO \isi{word order}: (44b) can only describe a situation in which each man caught the same fish. Lastly, in a sentence with OVS \isi{word order}, the \isi{subject} scopes over the \isi{object}, as shown in (44c).
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:44}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\glll Wąąkra	hi\v{z}ąki\v{s}ąną		hoohi\v{z}ą	gisikire.\\
wąąk-ra		hi\v{z}ąki\v{s}ąną		hoo-hi\v{z}ą	$\varnothing$-gisik-ire \\

\trans `Each man caught a fish.' (each > a; *a > each)

\trans `Each man caught a fish.'  (a > each; *each > a)
\ex

\trans `Each man caught a fish.' (each > a; *a > each)
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

 
These facts cannot be adequately accounted for if the \isi{subject} and \isi{object} are in a \isi{flat structure} in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk: there is no principled way that linear order could account for the interpretation of the sentences in \REF{ex:jrs:44}. In contrast, the interpretation of basic SOV \isi{word order} in (44a) is straightforwardly explained under a \is{verb phrase}VP analysis: the \isi{subject} is higher than the \isi{object} and thus scopes over it. Furthermore, we follow \citet{Johnson2014} and  \citet{JohnsonRosen2014} and propose that postverbal \isi{object}s (44b) and \isi{subject}s (44c) obligatorily take wide scope because they undergo movement that targets a position high in the \is{clauses}clause. 

\subsection{Resultatives and the Direct Object Restriction}

We now turn to an argument from \isi{resultative}s in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. Resultatives are complex \isi{predicate}s that put together a means \isi{predicate} (i.e., a verb) and a result \isi{predicate}, where neither is licensed by a \isi{conjunction} or an adposition \citep[507]{Williams2008}. As seen in \REF{ex:jrs:45}, \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk exhibits \isi{resultative}s: (45a) shows that the result \textit{paras} `flat' is immediately to the left the verb \textit{gistak} `hit', and a similar example is shown in (45b) with the result \textit{\v{s}uuc} `red and the verb \textit{hogiha} `paint'.
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:45}
\begin{xlist}
\ex 
\glll Meredithga	mąąsra		paras	gistak\v{s}ąną.\\
Meredith-ga			mąąs-ra	paras	$\varnothing$-gistak-\v{s}ąną \\
	Meredith-\textsc{prop}		metal-\textsc{def}		flat	 \textsc{3s/o}-hit-\textsc{decl} \\
\trans `Meredith hit the metal flat.'
\ex 
\glll Cecilga	wa\v{z}ątirera	 \v{s}uuc	hogiha.\\
Cecil-ga	wa\v{z}ątire-ra \v{s}uuc	$\varnothing$-hogiha \\
	Cecil-\textsc{prop}	car-\textsc{def}	red		\textsc{3s/o}-paint \\
\trans `Cecil painted the car red.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

 
\is{subject}Subjects and \isi{object}s behave differently in the \isi{resultative} construction. First, only the \isi{object} can be modified by the result. Second, only prototypical unaccusative verbs can be used in the \isi{resultative} construction. We use both of these pieces of evidence to support our claim that there is a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.
 

It has previously been observed for other languages, such as \ili{English}, that the \isi{resultative} \isi{predicate} must be linked to the ``deep'' \isi{object} of the verb.  \citet{LevinRappaportHovav1995} refer to this constraint as the \textit{Direct Object Restriction} (henceforth, DOR). In particular, the restriction states that only the \isi{object} of a transitive verb or the \isi{subject} of an unaccusative verb can be modified by the result \isi{predicate}. In contrast, a result \isi{predicate} cannot be linked to the \isi{subject} of an unergative verb. Consider the representative \ili{English} examples below in \REF{ex:jrs:46}.

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:46}
\begin{xlist}
\ex John hammered the metal flat.	(transitive)
\ex The water froze solid.						(unaccusative)
\ex *The dog barked hoarse.	(unergative; ungrammatical as \isi{resultative})
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
	
 
\il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk \isi{resultative}s obey the DOR. This is restriction is shown in \REF{ex:jrs:47} with the transitive verb \textit{gistak} `hit'.
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:47} 
\glll Rockyga			wan\k{i}ra			\v{s}uuc 		gistak\v{s}ąną.\\
Rocky-ga		wan\k{i}-ra		\v{s}uuc		$\varnothing$-gistak-\v{s}ąną \\
Rocky-\textsc{prop}	meat-\textsc{def}	red			\textsc{3s/o}-hit-\textsc{decl} \\
\trans $=$ `Rocky hit the meat red.'

$\neq$`Rocky hit the meat red and he was red as a result.'
\end{exe}

 
Since \textit{wan\k{i}ra} `the meat' is in \isi{object} position, it can be modified by the result, while the \isi{subject} of matrix verb Rocky cannot. Thus, \REF{ex:jrs:47} establishes a clear \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetry. If \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk had a \isi{flat structure}, we would not expect the result to only be able to modify the \isi{object}. In other words, the asymmetry would be difficult to explain without the presence of a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent.
	
Furthermore, only unaccusative (as opposed to unergative; cf. \citealt{Perlmutter1978}) verbs are compatible with \isi{resultative}s in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. This is demonstrated by the contrast between \REF{ex:jrs:48} and \REF{ex:jrs:49}.
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:48}
\begin{xlist}
\ex     
\glll Xaigirara			sgaasgap		ziibre.\\
xaigira-ra			sgaasgap		$\varnothing$-ziibre \\
	chocolate-\textsc{def}	sticky			\textsc{3s}-melt \\
\trans `The chocolate melted sticky.'
\ex  
\glll Waisgapra		seep		taaxu.\\
waisgap-ra		seep		$\varnothing$-taaxu \\
	bread-\textsc{def}		black		\textsc{3s}-burn \\
\trans `The bread burned black.'
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:49}
\begin{xlist}
\ex   [*]{ 
\glll Hinukra			n\k{i}\k{i}ra				teek	nąąwą.\\
hinuk-ra			n\k{i}\k{i}-ra				teek	$\varnothing$-nąąwą \\
		woman-\textsc{def}	 throat-\textsc{def}	sore	\textsc{3s/o}-sing \\
\trans (Intended: `The woman sang her throat sore.')}
\ex[*]{\label{ex:jrs:} 
\glll Henryga			wagu\k{i}irera		paras		nąąk\v{s}ąną.\\
Henry-ga		wagu\k{i}ire-ra	paras		$\varnothing$-nąąk-\v{s}ąną \\
		Henry-\textsc{prop}	shoe-\textsc{def}	flat	\textsc{3s/o}-run-\textsc{decl} \\
\trans (Intended: `Henry ran the shoe(s) flat.')}
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

 
Prototypical unaccusatives, such as \textit{ziibre} `melt' and \textit{taaxu} `burn', can serve as the matrix verb of \isi{resultative}s in \REF{ex:jrs:48}. On the other hand, prototypical unergative verbs, such as \textit{nąąwą} `sing' and \textit{nąąk} `run', cannot, as in \REF{ex:jrs:49}. Compare the \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk examples in \REF{ex:jrs:49} to the \ili{English} example in (46c). (46c) is ungrammatical because there was no \isi{object} present for the result \isi{predicate} to modify. In contrast, while the \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk examples in \REF{ex:jrs:49} have an \isi{object}, they are still ungrammatical.
	
Assuming \citegen{Perlmutter1978} unaccusative hypothesis, the single argument of an unaccusative verb is internal to the \is{verb phrase}VP, whereas the argument of an unergative verb is VP-external. The contrast between \REF{ex:jrs:48} and \REF{ex:jrs:49} provides evidence that \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk has an unaccusative-unergative split:\footnote{To the best of our knowledge, such a split has not been previously observed in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk. However, see \citet{Williamson1984} and \citet{West2003}, among others, for possible unaccusative-unergative splits in \ili{Lakota} and \ili{Assiniboine}, respectively.}  if there were no such distinction between unaccusative and unergative verbs, \REF{ex:jrs:49} would be expected to be grammatical, contrary to fact. If the \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk \is{verb phrase}VP were flat, we would not expect unergative verbs with \isi{resultative}s to be ungrammatical. As a result, this shows that the \is{verb phrase}VP in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk is not flat: we conclude that the data in this section provides further evidence for a \is{verb phrase}VP in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.

\subsection{Structure of the Hocąk VP}

In the sections above, we have seen that \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk shows \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries with respect to \isi{word order}, the enclitic scope, and \isi{coordination}. These same \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries have been previously documented\is{language documentation} in other Siouan languages. We also demonstrated that the facts from \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}VPE, \isi{resultative}s and the scope of adjuncts and arguments constitute additional \isi{subject}-\isi{object} asymmetries. The fact that we find so many asymmetries between the \isi{subject} and \isi{object} indicates that the \isi{subject} and the \isi{object} do not both form a constituent with the verb. Instead, we argue that these facts can be accounted for if the \isi{object} is the \isi{complement} of the verb in a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent. The \isi{subject} is base generated in a phrase that is external to the \is{verb phrase}VP, which we tentatively label ``\isi{XP}.'' A basic transitive verb phrase is represented in \REF{ex:jrs:50}.
 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:jrs:50} 
\Tree [ .\isi{XP} [ .Subject ] [ .\is{verb phrase}VP [ .Object ] [ .Verb ] ] ] 
\end{exe}

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:jrs:5}
 
The question of whether Siouan languages are \is{configurationality}configurational or nonconfigurational has been under debate for the past three decades. In this paper, we have presented new evidence to support a configurational analysis of \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.  We first showed that the tests previously used by \citet{Boyle2007} for \ili{Hidatsa}, \citet{Graczyk1991a} for \il{Apsaalooke}Crow and \citet{West2003} for \ili{Assiniboine} to argue in favor of a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent are also applicable in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.  Next we presented novel evidence from locative scope\is{scope, locative} \is{ellipsis, verb-phrase}verb-phrase ellipsis, quantifier scope\is{scope, quantifier}, and \isi{resultative} constructions which further support our claim that a \is{verb phrase}VP constituent exists in \il{Ho-Chunk}Hocąk.
