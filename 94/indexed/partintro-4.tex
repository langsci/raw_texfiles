Part IV consists of three chapters which compare some area of grammar across the Siouan family. The phenomena vary -- \isi{coordination} constructions, \isi{intonation}al and morphosyntactic variations as indices of \isi{information structure}, and the expression of possession\is{possessive construction} -- but the approach of all three authors is similar in that they compare the facts of a number of different Siouan languages, from different branches of the Siouan family, within the framework of a broader, cross-linguistic \isi{typology}.

Catherine Rudin\ia{Rudin, Catherine} (``Coordination\is{coordination} and related constructions in \ili{Omaha-Ponca} and in Siouan languages''), rather than demonstrating a shared characteristic of the Siouan family, shows that there is no common or typical Siouan \isi{coordination} pattern. Words meaning `and' or `or' are not cognate\is{cognates} among the various Siouan languages, sometimes even within one branch of Siouan. The syntactic\is{syntax} structure of conjoining constructions varies from language to language as well, sometimes involving structures other than true \isi{coordination}. This suggests that syntactic \isi{coordination} was not found in \ili{Proto-Siouan}, but developed later in the individual languages.

Bryan James Gordon\ia{Gordon, Bryan~James} (``Information-Structural Variations in Siouan Languages'') looks at the frequently ignored area of \isi{information structure}, using a \isi{corpus} study of variations in constituent order, reduction, \isi{intonation}al contour and other markings corresponding to specific types of \isi{topic}, focus and linking relations across a range of Siouan languages. The chapter includes discussion of the methodology the author developed for coding intonational and information structures.


Johannes Helmbrecht\ia{Helmbrecht, Johannes} (``NP-internal \isi{possessive construction}s in Hooc\k{a}k\il{Ho-Chunk} and other Siouan languages'') surveys at least one language from each branch of the Siouan family and examines how they express different types of possession. Besides \ili{Ho-Chunk}, the languages treated are Crow\il{Apsaalooke}, \ili{Hidatsa}, \ili{Mandan}, \ili{Lakota}, \ili{Osage} and \ili{Biloxi}. These languages have many similarities, but differ in how four basic morphosyntactic possessive types match up with semantic categories of possession (ownership, attribution of property, \isi{kinship}, etc.).
