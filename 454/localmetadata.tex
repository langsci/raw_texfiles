\BackTitle{Language and computers}
\BackBody{This book offers an accessible introduction to the ways that language is processed and produced by computers, a field that has recently exploded in interest.  The book covers writing systems, tools to help people write, computer-assisted language learning, the multidisciplinary study of text as data, text classification, information retrieval, machine translation, and dialog.  Throughout, we emphasize insights from linguistics along with the ethical and social consequences of emerging technology.

This book welcomes students from diverse intellectual backgrounds to learn new technical tools and to appreciate rich language data, thus widening the bridge between linguistics and computer science.

``At UT Austin, I've regularly taught a course based on the earlier version of this book, which attracts a mix of linguistics students looking to learn more about computation and computer science students looking to learn more about human language. It's incredibly valuable having a book that focuses on the core ideas about human language that underlie natural language technologies, and which explores deep underlying connections between human language processing and computational language processing. I'm delighted that this book has been updated to keep up with big changes in the field.'' -- Kyle Mahowald, University of Texas, Austin

``\emph{Language and Computers} provides an excellent introduction and overview to methods, tasks, and issues involved in getting computers to understand language.  It is sure to become a standard introductory textbook which will open many people's eyes both to the exciting opportunities and difficulties in developing language technologies.  In so doing, it is sure to inspire the next generation of computational linguists.'' -- Shane Steinert-Threlkeld, University of Washington
