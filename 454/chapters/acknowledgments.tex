\chapter{Acknowledgments}


\label{ch:acknowledgements}

The first edition of this book emerged from a course (\exword{Language
  and Computers}) taught at the Ohio State University beginning in
2004.  We are indebted to Peter Culicover and Beth Hume, who were at
the time Chair and Director of Undergraduate Studies of the
Linguistics Department, for their foresight in recognizing the
potential of such a course.  We also thank Danielle Descoteaux for
encouraging us to turn the course into a book, and Julia Kirk for her
work as project editor.

The second edition grew out of a course taught at Georgia Tech
beginning in 2018.  We thank Kyoko Masuda for proposing the course,
and Mark Riedl for helping to cross-list it with a Computer Science
number, thus attracting more diverse students.  We also thank Sam
Bowman, Timothy Dozat, and Yuval Pinter for helpful suggestions about how to structure
that course.

We express gratitude to curious and insightful students at Ohio State, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgetown University, Indiana University, and New York University for feedback as we developed and updated this book to use in their classes.

For generous and helpful feedback on individual chapters, we thank

Speaking individually, Lelia Glass thanks Mark Menzies for companionship and insight, as well as for discussion of Westlaw.  Thanks also to baby Lelia Carter Menzies for bringing joy and purpose.

Markus Dickinson expresses gratitude to Stephanie Dickinson for encouragement and support, as well as for dinnertime discussion of the sensitivity and specificity of medical tests. He also wants to thank all the students over the years who have helped make this material what it is, stemming back from 2004, when he had no clue what he was doing, and, in that light, he thanks his co-authors, for being there after he left academia and returned to having no clue.

Chris Brew thanks Sheena Phillips, Matthew and Jamie Brew.

Detmar Meurers thanks his coauthors as well as Walter Meurers for emphasizing the importance of connecting research issues with the real world.   He also thanks Kordula De Kuthy, Marius, Dario, and Cora for reminding him that life has a meaning beyond deadlines.
