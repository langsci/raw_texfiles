\lettrine[loversize=0.1, nindent=0.5em]{R}{en\'e de Saussure's little books on morphology} 
present a great many\linebreak points of interest, only
some of which can be addressed here. In the sections below, we discuss
first the background of Ren√©'s ideas in his work on Esperanto, and
then some ways in which the books anticipate themes that have been
developed in subsequent work by other scholars in the study of word
structure, and finally some noteworthy features of the theory of
meaning presumed (and presented) in the books.
