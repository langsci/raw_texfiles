\BackBody{This collection of papers on phrasal compounding is part of a bigger project whose
aims are twofold: First, it seeks to broaden the typological perspective by providing
data for as many different languages as possible to gain a better understanding
of the phenomenon itself. Second, based on these data which clearly
show interaction between syntax and morphology it aims to discuss theoretical
models which deal with this kind of interaction in different ways. Models like Generative Grammar, assume components of grammar and a clear-cut
distinction between the lexicon (often including morphology) and grammar.
Other models like construction grammar do not assume such components and
are rather based on a lexicon including constructs. A comparison of these models on the basis of this phenomenon on the morphology-syntax interface
makes it possible to assess their descriptive and explanatory power.}
