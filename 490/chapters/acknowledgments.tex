This book is a slightly revised version of my dissertation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the Faculty of Philosophy at Saarland University in Saarbrücken from 2024. A large number of people have contributed to the success of my doctorate, whom I would like to thank in the following.

First of all, I want to thank my supervisor and “Doktorvater” Ingo Reich from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for placing your trust in me, first as a student assistant, then as a research assistant substituting for parental leave, and finally as a doctoral student and project member. Thank you for always having an open door and an open ear for me, for the many constructive discussions about my project and the valuable comments on the earlier versions of this dissertation. 
I would also like to thank my second reviewer and co-supervisor Heiner Drenhaus. Through your persistent questioning in exactly the right places and your critical comments on my work, you helped to make this book more precise. And thank you also for the inspiring conversations we had at numerous coffee meetings.
Another big thank you goes to my third reviewer Hannah Rohde. Thank you so much for the effort you went to in order to be present at my defense and thereby making that special day even more special. Thank you also for your valuable feedback on my work, from which this published version has benefited greatly.
I would also like to thank the other members of my committee Stefanie Haberzettl, Elke Teich, and Robin Lemke for their time and effort. Thank you, Stefanie, for making the defense a special event with your personal words and thank you, Elke, for making my doctorate possible at all through founding and leading the collaborative research center (SFB) 1102.

For Robin, my former office neighbor and colleague in project B3 of the SFB 1102, I would like to express my special thanks. I am grateful for the enormous amount of feedback I received from you at numerous stages of this project. Thank you as well for always being available as a sparring partner for discussions about experimental stimuli, syntactic theories, and statistical analyses. In addition, you were a great travel companion on several work trips that took us to culinary delights such as the legendary Deep-Dish Pizza.
I would also like to thank my amazing current and former colleagues from the Department of Neuere deutsche Sprachwissenschaft at Saarland University in Saarbrücken for proofreading my thesis, for valuable feedback during the colloquium, and for creating a wonderful work atmosphere. Whether it's the daily visit to the Mensa, the games nights, the trips to the Christmas market, departmental hikes, or birthday and Christmas parties -- I've always had and still have a great time with you. Thanks to Philipp, Nele, Jenny, Constanze, Ricarda, Fabian, Dari, Lena, Luise, Sophia, Jessica, Natascha, Julia, Joanna, Josef, Augustin, and everyone else!
In addition, a big thank you also to the student assistants who supported me in this work by preparing stimuli and testing experimental setups. Thanks to Anna, Annika, Fabian, Katrin, Lea, Luise, Natascha, and Ricarda.

I would also like to thank all the members of the SFB 1102. Thanks to everyone who gave me constructive feedback on my project at several PhD Days and retreats. Thanks to Marie-Ann and the rest of the coordination team, whose patience overcame many a bureaucratic problem. I am also extremely grateful to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for their funding, without which this work and numerous valuable conference trips would not have been possible.\footnote{Gefördert durch die Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) – Projektnummer 232722074 – SFB 1102 / Funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) – Project-ID 232722074 – SFB 1102.}

Many thanks also to Michael T. Putnam and the rest of the editors of the Open Germanic Linguistics series for considering my work. Likewise, I am very grateful to the team at Language Science Press, especially to Sebastian Nordhoff and Felix Kopecky for their help with typesetting. And a big thank you to all the volunteer proofreaders who improved the language of this book considerably. All remaining errors are, of course, entirely my own.

Ein besonderes Dankeschön gilt meinen Freundinnen und Freunden, die mich über die anstrengenden Jahre immer wieder abgelenkt und aufgemuntert haben. Danke, dass ihr für mich da wart, Anne, Dennis, Hannah, Matthias, Sophie und alle anderen. Von ganzem Herzen danke ich auch meinen Eltern Ursula und Peter. Vielen Dank, dass ihr mich ermuntert habt, meinen Weg zu gehen und mich dabei bedingungslos unterstützt habt. Danke auch an meine Oma Doris, die immer an mich geglaubt hat. Und schließlich danke ich Jan -- für alles. Tausend Dank, dass du mich immer auffängst und dass du mich selbst an den härtesten Tagen zum Lachen bringst.
