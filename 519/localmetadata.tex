\subtitle{Selected papers from CSSP 2023}
\BackBody{The present volume in the series \emph{Empirical Issues in Syntax and Semantics} collects a curated selection of papers from the 2023 \emph{Colloque de Syntax et Sémantique à Paris} (CSSP 2023), held on December 7-8, 2023, at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. The result aims to be a snapshot of contemporary linguistic research in the areas of syntax and semantics.

CSSP has always been committed to fostering research uniting empirical rigor with formal precision, while remaining open to newly emerging methodologies, and multiple theoretical approaches. This volume embodies that spirit, presenting work that collectively demonstrates how contemporary linguistic research can simultaneously respect empirical complexity and seek theoretical generalization.}
