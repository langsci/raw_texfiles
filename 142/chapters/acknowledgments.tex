I am indebted to Mark Dingemanse for inviting me (several years ago) to contribute to the series he co-edits, and giving me the opportunity to support the \textit{Language Science Press} initiative. I am grateful to Mark for commenting on earlier versions of the manuscript, and for not giving up on me as I was taking much longer than anticipated in wrapping up the manuscript. 

The core ideas contained in this essay were presented in 2021 at the ``Future of Linguistics'' workshop organized by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. I am very grateful to the directors of the Institute for inviting me to take part in this workshop, and (again) to Mark Dingemanse for seizing this opportunity to renew his invitation for me to write something for the \textit{Conceptual Foundations of Language Science} series. Preparing for the ``Future of Linguistics'' lecture helped me enormously in organizing my thinking. Limor Raviv's input was also extremely valuable in bringing the essay to completion.

Although this is a short ``book'' (``pamphlet'' would be a better term, I feel), many people contributed to the ideas I present in it. The book reflects the evolution of my own thinking on the language sciences and language evolution over the past decade, and there are many people to thank. Doing so properly would require a book of its own, so I will limit myself to listing key influences.

Articulating conceptual arguments is a bit like constructing an edifice. You need a firm foundation, help with the overall building design, a strong team to make it all happen, as well as constant attention to the surrounding area and ecosystem.

For providing me with a firm foundation, I am grateful to Noam Chomsky, Howard Lasnik, Juan Uriagereka, Alec Marantz, Ray Jackendoff, Norbert Hornstein, Jean-Roger Vergnaud, Marc Hauser, and Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini. 

For making me think harder and better about the overall enterprise, I am extremely grateful to Simon Kirby, Simon Fisher, David Poeppel, and Dick Lewontin. I owe them a lot. Conversations with Gary Marcus, Gena Konopka, Tecumseh Fitch, Sonja Vernes, and Andrea Martin over the years were also extremely important in shaping my own thinking.

I have been extremely fortunate to receive the help of terrific students and collaborators, without whom I would be left with just empty promises. Thank you Constantina Theofanopoulou, Pedro Tiago Martins, Saleh Alamri, Bridget Samuels, Aritz Irurtzun, Rie Asano, Tom O'Rourke, Alejandro Andirko, Juan Moriano, Raul Buisan, Carmen Salda\~{n}a, Simone Gastaldon, Marcel Ruland, Sara Silvente, Ilaria Dutto, Giuseppe Testa and all the wonderful members of the Testa lab in Milan (which feels like a second home to me), Martin Kuhlwilm, Erich Jarvis, Bill Thompson, Bart de Boer, Andrea Ravignani, and the superb Evolinguistics community in Japan led by Kaz Okanoya and Koji Fujita. I have learned so much from each and everyone of them. 

For making me appreciate more the richness and variety of approaches in the language sciences, and for providing, through her own work, a model for how to integrate them in an evolutionary context, I owe a special note of gratitude to Limor Raviv.

For supporting my group's work, I acknowledge support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (grant PID2019-107042GB-I00), and from the Generalitat de Catalunya (2017-SGR-341).

I am grateful to Pedro Tiago Martins, Bridget Samuels and Rie Asano, trusted friends and former students, for taking the time to read and comment generously on a pre-final draft of this manuscript at short notice. Thank you also to Matt Spike and another, anonymous, reviewer for offering valuable suggestions. The book would be much better (but also much longer!) if I had been able to work them all into the final manuscript. Thanks also to Jeroen van de Weijer and Lachlan Mackenzie for proof-reading, and to Sebastian Nordhoff for assistance.

As my thinking evolved, two mentors (Morris Halle and Sylvain Bromberger) passed away. Like many others, I was extremely fortunate to learn from them and benefit from their advice. I am sorry Morris and Sylvain are no longer here for me to ask them questions and seek their wisdom, but some of the lessons they taught me remain very much with me.
