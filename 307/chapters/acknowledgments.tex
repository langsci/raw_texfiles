\addchap{Acknowledgments}
The publication of this volume took a lengthy chunk of time, for a number of reasons. We would like to thank all the authors for their infinite patience during this extended process.

We are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers engaged by us and likewise to the reviewers engaged by Language Science Press. All of you contributed enormously to improving the articles included here. 

We would also like to acknowledge the invaluable help of several people who helped convert many of the chapters to \LaTeX: Niina Manner, Elena Moser, Althea LÃ¶fgren and Nina Knobloch. 

Last but not least, we extend our warmest gratitude to Sebastian Nordhoff and Martin Haspelmath: thank you for the positive attitude, involvement, assistance and careful reading. This book will not be here without you.

For the financial support that made the workshop in Stockholm in May 2017 possible, we gratefully acknowledge the Stockholm-Helsinki collaboration fund as well as well as the Faculty of Arts at the University of Helsinki. We would also like to express our gratitude to the Department of Finnish, Finno-Ugrian and Scandinavian studies at the University of Helsinki who granted funding for the work on \LaTeX\ conversion.
