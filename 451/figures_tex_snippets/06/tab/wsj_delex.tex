\textbf{Text}: The presence of Unilever and P\&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics . While the two are among the world 's biggest advertisers , most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads . Instead , they  focus on events in department stores and pour their  promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases . Estee Lauder , for example , spends only an estimated 5 \% of sales on advertising in the U.S. , and Mr. Lauder says he  has no plans to change his  strategy . The most dramatic changes , however , probably will come in new - product development . \\ \midrule
