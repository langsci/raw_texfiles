\addchap{\lsAcknowledgementTitle} 

This book would not have been possible without the aid of numerous people and institutions in different parts of the world. I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of Ghent University, for funding my PhD position and two of my field trips. The financial support of the research organization Flanders (FWO) is acknowledged for another two field trips, as well as a number of conferences in which I presented ongoing research on Fwe to a wider audience. Within Ghent University, I want to thank all my colleagues, but especially my PhD supervisors Prof. Michael Meeuwis and Prof. Koen Bostoen, for their valuable support and input. Numerous others have contributed feedback and suggestions to improve this grammar. I am especially thankful to the members of my jury, Prof. Nancy Kula, Prof. Mark Van de Velde, Dr Maud Devos, and Dr Thera Crane, as well as two anonymous reviewers of this book. At Language Science Press, I am grateful to the editors, reviewers and proofreaders, and especially to Sebastian Nordhoff for his tireless assistance during the publication process.

In Southern Africa, I thank the University of Namibia and the Livingstone Museum of Zambia for their practical and official support with setting up my fieldwork. I am also thankful to Hennie Schoonwinkel, Lieneke de Visser and Orbet Pilaelo for everything they did to make fieldwork possible and enjoyable. Words (in English or Fwe) cannot express how grateful I am to all the Fwe speakers who contributed to my research: Mr. Bonard Simasiku, Mr. Ephraim Mafaya Mbango, Mr. Sishwashwa Muketwa Nector, Mr. Mutoiwa Namangolwa; Mr. Felix, Mrs Rebecca Maunda, Ms Betty Muyendekwa, induna Jared; Ms. Grace Muyendekwa; Mr. Event Mubika Linyando, and Mr. Aldrin Mahulilo Haluzibi. It is to them, and all the other Fwe speakers of the present and future, that I dedicate this work.
