\title{A grammar of Fwe}

\BackBody{This book provides a first-ever comprehensive overview of the grammatical structure of Fwe. Fwe is a Bantu language spoken on the border between Zambia and Namibia, by some 20,000 people. Very little previous documentation exists on the language, and the current description of Fwe is based exclusively on data collected by myself in both Zambia and Namibia, between 2013 and 2017 for a total of about 7 months. An earlier version of this grammar served as a dissertation for obtaining the degree of PhD in African Languages and Cultures from Ghent University in 2018.}
