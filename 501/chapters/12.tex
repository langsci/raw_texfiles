The word \textit{but}, in many of its applications, has a negative force. At first, it is a preposition, Old English \textit{be-utan}, formed like \textit{without}, and acquiring the same negative signification as that word. But gradually, it came to be used in a variety of ways not shared by \textit{without}. It is only with the negative applications that we are here concerned. 

\textit{But} is a kind of negative relative pronoun, meaning `that (who or which) {\dots} not', but only used after a negative expression.

Examples: (\ref{ex:12-01}).

In most cases, the relative pronoun represented by \textit{but} is the subject of the clause, but it may also be the object of a verb (\ref{ex:12-09}); rarely, however, the object of a preposition placed at the end of the clause: (\ref{ex:12-09a}).

The negative idea that conditions this use of \textit{but} may be expressed indirectly, or it may be what has been termed above an incomplete negative. It is sometimes wrongly asserted that Shakespeare did not use this \textit{but} after an interrogative sentence with negative import. Examples: \refp{ex:12-18}--\refp{ex:12-18b}.

In some cases, \textit{but} is followed by a personal pronoun in such a way that both together make up a relative pronoun (\textit{but they} meaning `who {\dots} not', etc.); the phenomenon may be compared with the popular use of \textit{that} or \textit{which} followed by \textit{he} or \textit{him}, etc. \textit{But}, in this case, is not a real relative pronoun, but rather a ``relative connective''.

\textit{But} evidently in all these cases means the same thing to the popular speech instinct; it stands as the natural conjunction where the notion is negative. But it is easy to see that it really stands for two strictly opposite ideas, according as the main sentence is simply negative or doubly negative, i.e., positive. In the former case \textit{but} gives a negative force to the dependent clause, in the latter case it does not. Thus, \xref{ex:WS1} above means `my master knows not otherwise than that I am gone hence', he believes that I am gone, he does not know that I am not gone; but in \xref{ex:WS2}, if for \textit{it must not be denied} we substitute the equivalent \textit{it is certain}, we must say \textit{that I am a plain-dealing villain} without any \textit{not}. The use of \textit{but} in such cases, therefore, is on a par with the redundant use of negatives in popular speech (above, p.~\pageref{paratactic}) and, like that, has now been generally discarded in educated speech and writing, so that the usual expression now is \textit{it must not be denied that I am}. {\dots} (``Here, \textit{that} is now considered more logical''---\href{https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.211152/page/n1239/mode/2up?view=theater}{\textit{NED}}, \textit{But} C \textit{conj.}~21.)

The use of \textit{but what} cannot be easily accounted for; the \textit{NED} attempts no explanation, but simply brands the use as ``erroneous'' in all cases (\textit{But} \href{https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.211152/page/n1239/mode/2up?view=theater}{C \textit{conj.} 12c}, \href{https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.211152/page/n1241/mode/2up?view=theater}{C \textit{conj.} 30}). Perhaps \textit{but what} first began in the relative employment (see p.~\pageref{relative_employment}f), where \textit{what} has sometimes approximately its usual force (as in the quotation on p.~\pageref{defoe_quote} from Defoe), and as \textit{but what} was thus felt to be the equivalent of \textit{but that}, it was substituted for that combination in other cases as well.

\textit{But}, or more frequently \il{English!but that@\textit{but that}}\textit{but that}, serves to introduce a clause of condition, `if {\dots} not'. An old combination, which has long been obsolete, was \il{English!but if@\textit{but if}}\textit{but if}. Examples of all three: (\ref{ex:12-132})--(\ref{ex:12-132b}).

\is{betting, metaphors referring to|(}
The same idea is very often expressed in betting terms as in the following quotations. But it should be noted that though \textit{ten to one but he comes} means originally `you may bet ten to one if he does not come', the negative idea has now disappeared, and it means `the chances are that he does come'; to the old phrase \textit{it is odds but he comes} therefore corresponds the modern \textit{the odds are that he comes}. Besides \textit{but} we find in the 18th century also \textit{but that} (\ref{ex:12-143b}).

\label{but_for}With \textit{but} in the sense `if {\dots} not' should also be placed the common elliptical idiom \textit{but for}: \textit{But for him we should have succeeded}, i.e. `if it had not been for him', `if he had not hindered it'.

\il{English!only@\textit{only}}
\is{only@`only', words meaning}
\label{12-nobbut}By a curious transition \textit{but} has come to mean the same thing as `only'; at first it required a preceding negative: \textit{I will not say but one word}, i.e., `not except (save) one word'; compare the form used in northern dialects 
\il{English!dialectal!northern England!\textit{nobbut}}\textit{nobbut}. But then the negative was dropped out, and \textit{I will say but one word} came to be used in exactly the same signification. The curious thing is that exactly the same thing has happened in German, where 
\il{German!nur@\textit{nur}}\textit{nur} at first required a negative word before it (it originated in \textit{ne wäre}); cf. also vulgar French \textit{je dis qu' ça}.

Old examples of \textit{but} in this way after a negative are easily found in the dictionaries; I shall therefore give only one: (\ref{ex:12-156}). The expression is strengthened by \textit{only} in (\ref{ex:12-157}).

As \textit{but} and \textit{only} are thus synonyms, by a natural reaction \textit{only} acquires some of the properties at first belonging exclusively to \textit{but}.

\is{except that@`except that/when', expressions meaning}
\il{English!only that@\textit{only that}}
\textit{Only that} comes to mean `except that' (or something very similar to that) and eventually even `if {\dots} not', exactly like \textit{but that}. Examples: (\ref{ex:12-160}).

Let me also mention the possibility of a negative answer after \textit{only} because it is = \textit{none but}.

If we were to ask the question `Had you only the children with you?' a person south of the Tweed\footnote{Loosely, a person from south of the River Tweed is English and another from north of it is Scots. \eds} would answer `\textit{no}', and a person north of the Tweed `\textit{yes}', both meaning the same thing---viz, that only the children were there. I think I should myself, though a Southron, answer \textit{yes}.
