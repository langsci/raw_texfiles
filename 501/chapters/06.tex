\ChapterAndMark{Negative Attraction} 
\label{ch:6}
\is{attraction!of negative other than to verb|(}
\is{position of negative|(}
\is{special negation!instead of nexal negation|(}

While the preceding chapter has shown the universal tendency to attract the negative to the verb even where it logically belongs to some other word, there is another tendency to attract the negative notion to any word that can easily be made negative.\label{p:made-neg}\is{colloquial syntax v. literary syntax}\is{literary syntax v. colloquial syntax} In colloquial language the former is the stronger tendency, but in literary English the latter often predominates because it yields a more elegant expression. Thus to the colloquial \textit{we didn't meet anybody} corresponds a more literary \textit{we met nobody}. Cf. also \textit{union won't be an easy matter} and \textit{union will be no easy matter}. 

In the following sentences \refp{ex:06-01} the negative really belongs to the nexus and should therefore be placed with the verb; note especially the tag question (\textit{have we}? as after a negative \textit{we haven't got}) in \refp{ex:06-got-have-we}. % PE: I've rearranged the content of this sentence.

\il{Danish!ingen@\textit{ingen}|(} \il{Danish!ingenting@\textit{ingenting}|(}The attraction of the negative element is the reason why a pronoun, like \textit{ingen},\textit{ ingenting}, \il{Danish!intet@\textit{intet}}\textit{intet} is very often in Danish placed in a position which would be impossible in the case of a positive pronoun, but is the one required for the adverb \textit{ikke}: \refp{ex:06-19}, or, more popularly, \refp{ex:06-22}, etc. Cf. also the following quotations \refp{ex:06-23}, the last two or three of which are, perhaps, not quite natural, though the attraction in them is easy to understand. Bjørnson's \refp{ex:06-30} % ??? PE: This was my helpful (?) addition. BB is described (in Wikipedia, etc) as Norwegian and as a writer of great Norwegian literature, and OJ contrasts this with "natural Danish". All in all "It's in Norwegian" seemed the obvious inference. But for all I know, it might better be described as Norwegian-dialect-inflected Danish. Ideally, we'd get a comment from an L1 Danish or (better) Norwegian speaker.

\label{join-to-first}Whenever there is logically a possibility of attracting the negative element to either of two words, there seems to be a universal tendency to join it to the first. We may say \il{English!no one@\textit{no one}}\textit{\textsc{no one ever} saw him angry} or \textit{\textsc{never} did \textsc{any one} see him angry}, but not \textit{\textsc{any one never} saw him angry} nor \textit{\textsc{ever} did \textsc{no one} see him angry}. In the same way in Danish \textit{\textsc{ingen} har \textsc{nogensinde} set ham vred} or \textit{\textsc{aldrig} har \textsc{nogen} set ham vred}, but not otherwise. Instead of \textit{\textsc{no} woman would \textsc{ever} think of that} it is impossible to say \textit{\textsc{any} woman would \textsc{never} think of that}, though it is possible to say \textit{\textsc{a} woman would \textsc{never} think of that}, because \textit{no} is not (now) felt to be a combination of the negative element and the indefinite article. % Peter: Now shorn of underlining to show emphasis-within-what's-already-italicized, this is hard to understand. But in this paragraph OJ makes liberal use of " ". The result isn't elegant, but it's easier to follow. Shall we do the same? 
% Brett: Now the emphasized elements seem de-emphasized. How about small caps?
% PE: Done
\il{Danish!ingen@\textit{ingen}|)}

\is{grammaticalization}
The negative is also attracted to the first word in well-known Latin combinations \il{Latin!neque quisquam@\textit{neque quisquam}}\textit{neque quisquam} `and no one' (not \il{Latin!et nemo@\textit{et nemo}}\textit{et nemo}), \il{Latin!neque ullus@\textit{neque ullus}}\textit{neque ullus} `and nothing', \il{Latin!nec unquam@\textit{nec unquam}}\textit{nec unquam} `and never'; thus also \il{Latin!ne quis@\textit{ne quis}}\textit{ne quis}, \il{Latin!ne quid@\textit{ne quid}}\textit{ne quid}, etc., in clauses of purpose. The same tendency is found in combinations like \textit{without any danger}, \textit{uden nogen fare}, \textit{sine ullo periculo}, where, however, English sometimes has \textit{with no danger} (\textit{to any one}); cf. \refp{ex:06-31}.\largerpage[2]

"parents", or "ancestors"? (If "parents", then not "any" but "either" ... and even then, the result would I think be subtly ungrammatical.
%% SG: The reason is that the negative polarity item "nogen" is triggered by the negation in the previous clause "I am no rooster". I think the best solution is to write "neither" in the Eng. transl.

(i.e. newspaper or magazine) quote, for no other "NP" quote, I think, does he specify the date. So I really wonder....

\il{English!and not@\textit{and not}|(}\textit{And} with a negative infinitive means the same thing as \textit{without -ing}. This is felt to be perfectly natural in positive sentences (\ref{ex:positive}), but there is a growing awkwardness about the construction in the following groups: negative sentences (\ref{ex:negative}), interrogative sentences, generally equivalent to negative statements (\ref{ex:interrogative}), and negative interrogative sentences (\ref{ex:neg-interrogative}); the sentence in (\ref{ex:unanalyzable}) is, strictly speaking, quite unanalyzable. In \textit{I couldn't see you, and not love you} (\ref{ex:negative-love}) \textit{couldn't} refers at the same time to \textit{see you}, and to \textit{not love you}, the latter in a way that would be quite unidiomatic if used by itself: \textit{I couldn't not love you} (cf. Latin \il{Latin!non possum non amare@\textit{non possum non amare}}\textit{non possum non amare}); we see that the expression is unimpeachable if we substitute: \il{English!impossible@\textit{impossible}}\textit{Impossible} (\textit{to see you and}) \textit{not to love you}.
