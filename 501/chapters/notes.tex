I have used ChatGPT-4 extensively to clean up OCR errors, make formatting changes, and do translations.

In resetting and this book, the following changes have been made:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All the addenda from pp 150--151 from the 1917 edition have been incorporated into the text in the appropriate locations.
    \item Examples, which were originally set in paragraphs with \vert as a separator, have been mostly set as numbered examples in italics, typical of modern norms.
    \item Italics for emphasis has been changed to underline. 
    \item Italicized terms have been reset in small caps.
\end{itemize}

The following are planned:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Material not in Modern English has been translated into English.
    \item Examples begin with a capital if they begin a sentence, regardless of the case of the original quote.
    \item The citations and references have been given following the Leipzig style rules for linguistics.
    \item Most abbreviations have been written out in full.
\end{itemize}

The following are considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item remove most double quotation marks (and replace, where needed with italics), except for dialogues. 
    \item replace most square brackets with parentheses
    \item remove most = signs
\end{itemize}

Peter's notes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item examples (in any language): italics
    \item words (not within italics) that are emphasized: italicized
    \item words (within italics) that are emphasized: underlined as well as italicized
    \item glosses of examples: in single quotation marks
    \item quotations (other than examples): in double quotation marks
    \item parentheses ( ) and brackets [ ] within italics: not themselves italicized
    \item what would normally be in parentheses, but within text that is already in parentheses: in parentheses, not brackets. Thus "(Bunyan P. 147 (ibid 124))", not "(Bunyan P. 147 [ibid 124])"
    \item corrections to OJ should be minimal. As an example, in the final paragraph he writes "Mr. Daniel Jones, in his Pronouncing English Dictionay 1917, does not...". The actual title is Everyman's Pronouncing English Dictionary. But Everyman's is in a smaller font than the rest, and therefore "in his English Pronouncing Dictionary 1917, does not...".
    \item examples that OJ placed in parentheses ( ), etc: formatted as regular examples are, yet retain OJ's punctuation. Thus "(65) (Haâ€™ not (2. syll.) you seen Camillo (Sh. Wint. I. 2. 267));" (the whole thing is in parentheses, and ends with a semicolon). Uh, except that "Sh. Wint." should perhaps be "Shak., Tale" but I'm not sure (see below), and --
