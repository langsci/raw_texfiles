\il{French!pas@\textit{pas}|(}\il{French!ne@\textit{ne}|(}The best-known examples of a transition from positive to negative meaning are found in French.

As this came to be used exclusively in immediate juxtaposition with a verb, the other words were in themselves sufficient to express the negative notion when there was no verb, at first perhaps in answers: ``\textit{Ne viendra-t-il jamais?}'' ``\emph{\textit{\textsc{Jamais}}}.''; ``\textit{Ne vois-tu personne?}'' ``\emph{\textit{\textsc{Personne}}}.''

PE: I think that this is unnecessarily confusing. As we are anyway glossing (Late Modern) French in English, there's no obvious need for OJ to do so in French (let alone any need for us to gloss his gloss). But we, or anyway I, would like to be able to say that we haven't removed anything. So how about removing OJ's gloss from where he placed it, and instead placing it within a footnote? (Something like: "Jespersen glosses this: `et tous les enfants assis en ligne mangeait jusqu'à ce qu'ils n'eussent plus faim'.")

\il{French!ne@\textit{ne}|(}The next step is the leaving out of \textit{ne} even where there is a verb. This may have begun through \is{prosiopesis}prosiopesis in \is{interrogatives}interrogative and \is{imperatives}imperative sentences: (\textit{ne}) \textit{viens-tu \textsc{pas}?}; (\textit{ne}) \textit{dis \textsc{pas} ça!} Cf. also (\textit{Il ne}) \textit{faut \textsc{pas} dire ça!} It may have been a concomitant circumstance in favour of the omission that it is in many sentences impossible or difficult to hear \textit{ne} distinctly in rapid \is{pronunciation, influence of}pronunciation: \textit{on n'a pas} \texttt{\vert} \textit{on n'est pas} \texttt{\vert} \il{French!jamais@\textit{jamais}}\textit{on n'arrive jamais} \texttt{\vert} \il{French!rien@\textit{rien}}\textit{la bonne n'a rien} \texttt{\vert} \textit{je ne nie pas}, etc. Sentences without \textit{ne}, which may be heard any day in France, also among the educated, begin to creep into literature, as in \refp{ex:03-09}. (Similarly \textit{ne} is now often omitted in those cases in which ``correct grammar'' requires its use without any \textit{pas}, for instance \textit{de peur qu'il vienne}.) In the soldiers' conversations in René Benjamin's \textit{Gaspard}\footnote{A 1915 novel, winner of the Prix Goncourt, based on the author's experiences during months-long hospitalization following war injuries. \eds} there is scarcely a single \textit{ne} left.\il{French!ne@\textit{ne}|)} % ???

\il{French!plus@\textit{plus}|(}In the case of \textit{plus} this new development might lead to frequent ambiguity, if this had not been obviated in the popular \is{pronunciation, disambiguating}pronunciation, in which [j ãn a ply] means `there is no more of it' and [j ãn a plys] `there is more of it' (literary \textit{il n'y en a plus} and \textit{il y en a plus}). In \textit{plus de bruit} we have a negative, but in \textit{Plus de bruit que de mal} a positive expression, though here the pronunciation is always the same. Note the difference between \textit{Jean n'avait plus confiance} and \textit{Jean n'avait pas plus confiance} [\textit{que Pierre}]; cf. also \textit{Jean n'avait pas confiance, non plus} (`nor had {\dots}').\il{French!pas@\textit{pas}|)}

There is a curious consequence of this negative use of \textit{plus}, namely that \il{French!moins@\textit{moins}}\textit{moins} may occasionally appear as a kind of comparative of its etymological antithesis \refp{ex:03-19}.

 {no more} {of schools} {no more} {of asylums} {no more} of charity even less of theology\\ % Peter: I'm puzzled by the inclusion of "no", three times. We're purporting to give the literal meaning, so delete all three.
 %Brett: I don't understand. Don't we need at least one? And since Mérimée didn't write "Plus d'écoles, d'asiles, de bienfaisance", then why should we elide two "no"s?
 % PE: I suppose the problem is one of just how literal our "literal" should be. Perhaps "literally" this should be "more of schools, more of asylums, more of charity, even less of theology". Of course each "plus" means "no more"; yes, it could be argued that for a century or longer it has "literally" meant this.
 %Brett: I think that's the point of the example.

\is{lexical change|(}\il{French!ne@\textit{ne}|(}One final remark before we leave French. From a psychological point of view it is exactly the same process that leads to the omission of \textit{ne} in two sentences like \textit{il} (\textit{ne})\textit{ voit \il{French!nul@\textit{nul}}nul danger} and \textit{il} (\textit{ne})\textit{ voit \il{French!aucun@\textit{aucun}}aucun danger}; but etymologically they are opposites: in one an originally negative word keeps its value, in the other an originally positive word is finally changed into a negative word.\il{French!ne@\textit{ne}|)}


In Spanish we have some curious instances of positive words turned into negative ones: \il{Spanish!nada@\textit{nada}}\textit{nada} from Latin \il{Latin!nata@\textit{nata}}\textit{nata} \il{Latin!res nata@\textit{res nata}}(\textit{res nata}) means `nothing', and \il{Spanish!nadie@\textit{nadie}}\textit{nadie}, older \il{Spanish!nadien@\textit{nadien}}\textit{nadien} with the ending of \il{Spanish!quien@\textit{quien}}\textit{quien} instead of \il{Spanish!nado@\textit{nado}}\textit{nado} from \il{Latin!natus@\textit{natus}}\textit{natus}, means `nobody'. In both I imagine that the initial sound of \textit{n-} as in \textit{no} has favoured the change. Through the omission of \textit{no} some temporal phrases come to mean `never' as in \refp{ex:03-20}. Thus also \il{Spanish!absolutamente@\textit{absolutamente}}\textit{absolutamente} (`durchaus nicht', `not at all'), see \citet[\href{https://archive.org/details/spanischegrammat00hansuoft/page/204/mode/2up?q=absolutamente&view=theater}{§60, 5}]{hanssen1910spanische}.
