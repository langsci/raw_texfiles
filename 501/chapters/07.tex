\is{double negation!law of}
When logicians insist that ``two negatives make an affirmative'' their rule is not corroborated by actual usage in most languages. But it would be wrong to divide languages into some that follow this rule and others that do not, for on closer inspection we find that in spite of great differences between languages in this respect there are certain underlying principles that hold good for all languages. We shall deal first with those instances in which the rule of the logicians is observed; and afterwards with those in which the final result of two negatives is in itself negative.

First, it seems to be a universal rule in all languages that \textit{two negatives make an affirmative}, if both are special negatives attached to the same word; this generally happens in this way that \textit{not} is placed before some word of negative import or containing a negative prefix. But it should be noted that the double negative always modifies the idea, for the result of the whole expression is somewhat different from the simple idea expressed positively. Thus \textit{not without some doubt} is not exactly the same thing as \textit{with some doubt}; \textit{not uncommon} is weaker than \textit{common}, and \textit{not unhandsome} (\href{https://archive.org/details/lightthatfailed0000rudy_q6g8/page/258/mode/2up?q=%22for+he+was+not%22&view=theater}{Kipling, \textit{Light} 246}) than \textit{handsome}, the psychological reason being that the \textit{detour} through the two mutually destroying negatives weakens the \is{mental energy for comprehension}mental energy of the hearer and implies on the part of the speaker a certain hesitation absent from the blunt, outspoken \textit{common} or \textit{handsome}, as in \refp{ex:07-01}. Assertion by negative of opposite is a common feature of English as spoken in Ireland (see \cite[\href{https://archive.org/details/englishaswespeak00joycuoft/page/15/mode/2up?view=theater}{16}]{joyce1910english}):
\textit{this little rasher will do you no harm} meaning it will do you good; \textit{Paddy Walsh is no chicken now} meaning he is very old, etc. This is really on a par with \textit{not untragical}, \textit{not unentitled to speak}, \textit{not unpromptly}, etc. which abound in Carlyle \citep[\href{https://archive.org/details/englischestudien06leipuoft/page/388/mode/2up?view=theater}{388}]{krummacher1883notizen}; with him \textit{not without} has become quite a mannerism for which he is taken to task by Sterling (\href{https://archive.org/details/lifeofjohnsterli00carliala/page/146/mode/2up?q=%22not+without%22&view=theater}{letter}): \textit{not without ferocity}, \textit{not without result}, \textit{not without meditation}, etc. etc.

\is{indirect negation}
A special instance of this detour is Latin \il{Latin!non@\textit{non}}\textit{non-nunquam} (`not never'), \textit{non-nulli} (`not none'), on the meaning of which see p.~\pageref{08-non-nulli} (\chapref{ch:8}). % PE: OJ merely says chapter VIII, with no page number.

Next, the result is positive if we have a nexal negative in a sentence containing an implied negative, as in \textit{I do not deny}; this, of course, closely resembles the first case. Here belong such frequent French phrases as \textit{il n'était pas sans être frappé par la différence}; the meaning of the round-about expression is `you will readily understand that he was struck {\dots}'.

In this place should, perhaps, be mentioned the French \textit{il n'y a pas que ça} (`there is not only this'), which means the opposite of \textit{il n'y a que ça}, thus `there is more than this'. 

The negation of words like \textit{nobody} resulting in the meaning of `everybody' (\textit{nemo non videt}) will be treated in \chapref{ch:8} (p.~\pageref{08-negativing-nobody}f). % PE: OJ merely says chapter VIII.

Yet another way of affirming through a double negative is seen in \refp{ex:07-02}. But this hardly belongs in this chapter.

But Henley is the primary author of the book that this appears in (and it doesn't appear in Henderson's own biography of Burns).

\is{double negation!for negation}

If now we proceed to those cases in which \textit{a repeated negation means, not an affirmative, but a negative}, we shall do well to separate different classes in which the psychological explanation is not exactly the same.

\is{attraction!double|(}
\is{cumulative negation|(}
\AddSubSection{Double attraction}
In the first place we have instances of \textsc{double attraction}. % ??? PE: Should this be in small caps rather than italics?
Above we have seen the two tendencies, one to place the negative with the verb as nexal negative, and the other to amalgamate a negative element with some word capable of receiving a negative prefix. We have seen how now one, now the other of these tendencies prevails; but here we have to deal with those instances in which both are satisfied at once in popular speech, the result being sentences with double, or even treble or quadruple, negation.

\is{adverbs!negative|(}\il{English!Old English!ne@\textit{ne}|(}This was the regular idiom in Old English, so regular indeed that in the whole of \href{https://archive.org/details/anglosaxonversi00thorgoog}{\textit{Apollonius}} there is only one sentence containing \textit{ne} with the verb in which we have another word that might take \il{English!Old English!n-@\textit{n-}|(}\textit{n-} and does not---\textit{ne ondræt þu ðe æniges þinges} (`do not fear anything') (\href{https://archive.org/details/anglosaxonversi00thorgoog/page/n32/mode/2up?q=%22ne+ondrset+fu+t%24e+seniges%22&view=theater}{Appolonius: 22})%

There are 40 instances of \textit{ne} or \textit{n-} with the verb without any other word that might take \mbox{\textit{n-}\il{English!Old English!n-@\textit{n-}},} and four of \textit{na} as special negative without any verb. In this text there are no instances of treble or quadruple negation, but these are by no means rare in Old English prose, as in  \refp{ex:07-03}. In the same way in Middle English, e.g. \refp{ex:07-05}.

In context, this meant "no league(s) with any nation". I've slightly reordered what OJ wrote.

In Elizabethan English this kind of repeated negation is comparatively rare; from Shakespeare I have only two instances (\ref{ex:07-11}; but I may, of course, have overlooked others). \citet{bogholm1906bacon} has one from Bacon (\href{https://archive.org/details/lettersandlifef08bacogoog/page/n219/mode/2up?q=%22never+no+violent%22&view=theater}{\textit{Observations}}): \textit{his lordship was \textsc{n}ever \textsc{n}o violent and transported man}. % "his lordship" and "and transported" restored

I cannot explain how it is that this particular redundancy seems to disappear for two centuries; it can hardly be accidental that I have no examples from the beginning of the seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth century, when \citet[\href{https://archive.org/details/anecdotesofengli00peggrich/page/80/mode/2up?q=luxuriance&view=theater}{80}]{pegge1814anecdotes} mentions this kind of ``luxuriance'' among the cockneys (\textit{I \textsc{don't} know \textsc{nothing} about it}) and says that he has heard in Yorkshire, \textit{No, I shall \textsc{not} do \textsc{no} such thing} and that a citizen is said to have enquired at a tavern, \textit{if \textsc{nobody} had seen \textsc{nothing} of \textsc{never-a} hat \textsc{nowhere's}?}

This was continued in later centuries, though as in English it was counteracted by schoolmasters.

This is particularly frequent in vulgar language. In \citet[\href{https://archive.org/details/unseremutterspr03weisgoog/page/n88/mode/2up?view=theater}{78}]{weise1896unsere} I find the following:


\begin{quote}
  
Die Verneinung wird nachdrücklich wiederholt, damit sie recht ins Gewicht fällt. In Angelys Fest der Handwerker wird einem Gesellen auf die Frage: ‘Hat keener Schwamm?’ nicht geantwortet; als er dann aber der Frage die Form giebt: ‘Hat denn \emph{keener} \emph{keinen} Schwamm \emph{nich}?’ findet er Gehör. Doch kann einer der Anwesenden seinen Unwillen darüber nicht zurückhalten, dass er nicht gleich ordentlich deutsch geredet habe.

\end{quote} % I (PE) suggest NOT presenting this as a numbered example but instead presenting the German original (not in italics), followed by a gloss in English -- in the same way that, in chapter 5, we treat quotations from Vondrák, Krüger, and Kühner (all on p 53 of OJ's printed book)

In Danish similar expressions are extremely rare. Leonora Christina % "Leonora Christina" is PE's emendation of OJ's "El. Christine". Perhaps "Christine" is OJ's anglicization, but "El." mystifies PE. (Feel free to change it back; but if so, then alter and move the bibliography entry.)

Sometimes there are three negative words in the same sentence: \textit{\textsc{nëm} felejtëk el \textsc{sëmmit sëm}} `I forget nothing'. Negative words begin with \textit{s-} or \textit{n-}.

Various explanations have been given of this phenomenon, but they mostly fail through not recognizing that this kind of repeated negation is really different from that found, for instance, when in Latin \il{Latin!non@\textit{non}}\textit{non} is followed by \il{Latin!ne@\textit{ne}}\textit{ne {\dots} quidem}; this will form our second class, but the explanation from ``supplementary negation'' (\textit{Ergänzungsnegation}), which is there all right, does not hold in the cases here considered. \ia{van Ginneken, Jacobus}Van Ginneken is right when he criticizes (\citeyear[\href{https://archive.org/details/principesdelingu00ginn/page/200/mode/2up?view=theater\&q=\%22Les\%20romanistes\%20ont\%20mis\%20en\%20usage\%22}{200}]{vanginneken1907principes}) the view of Romance scholars, who speak of a \is{half-negation}``half-negation'' (\textit{demi-négation})---an expression which may be more true of French \il{French!ne@\textit{ne}}\textit{ne} than of other negatives, but even there is not quite to the point. \ia{van Ginneken, Jacobus}Van Ginneken's own explanation is that ``negation in natural language is not logical negation, but the expression of a feeling of resistance''. He goes on to say:

\begin{quote}
L'adhésion négative logique ou mathématique (dont deux se compensent) est leur signification figurée, née seulement dans quelques centres de civilisation isolés; jamais et nulle part elle n'a pénétré dans le domaine populaire. % This is from the same page (200)

`The negative logical or mathematical adhesion (two of which compensate each other) is their figurative meaning, born only in a few isolated centers of civilization; never and nowhere has it penetrated the popular domain.' 
\end{quote}

\noindent It is true that if we look upon \textit{not}, etc., as expressing nothing but resistance, it is easy to see why such an element should be repeated over and over again in a sentence as the most effective way of resisting; but I very much doubt the primitivity of such an idea, and the theory looks suspiciously as having been invented, not from any knowledge of the natural mind of people in general, but from a desire to explain the grammatical phenomenon in question. I cannot imagine that when one of our primitive ancestors said \textit{he does not sleep}, he understood this as meaning `let us resist the idea of sleep in connexion with him'---or how is otherwise % ??? PE: "how is otherwise" strikes me as plain ungrammatical; I suspect it was a typo for "how otherwise is". Feel free to disagree; but if you agree then let's amend it.
the idea of resistance to come in here? I rather imagine he understood it exactly as we do nowadays.

But I quite agree with \ia{van Ginneken, Jacobus}van Ginneken, when he emphasizes the emotional character of repeated negation; already H. Ziemer, \textit{Junggrammatische Streifzüge} (\citeyear[\href{https://archive.org/details/junggrammatisch00ziemgoog/page/n163/mode/2up?view=theater\&q=\%22Der+sondernde\%22}{142}]{ziemer1883junggrammatische}) % Again, deliberately simplified: details in the bibliography.

\noindent (though \citet{mourek1902ueber} is probably right when he says that the strengthening is a result, rather than the motive, of the repetition). I may also, like \ia{van Ginneken, Jacobus}van Ginneken, quote with approval Cauer's clever remark (\citeyear[\href{https://archive.org/details/grammaticamilit00cauegoog/page/50/mode/2up?q=\%22zugleich+vor+und+in+der+klammer\%22&view=theater}{50}]{cauer1903grammatica}): % Instead of linking from "remark", I (PE) would far prefer to link from the footnote -- but we've found that attempting this seems to bring LaTeX syntax errors.

\is{Kantian categories}
\is{qualitative v. quantitative negation|(}
\label{sec:kant}There is one theory that has enjoyed a certain vogue of late years (though it is not mentioned by \ia{van Ginneken, Jacobus}van Ginneken) and which I must deal with a little more in detail. It was started by \ia{Gebauer, Jan}Gebauer\footnote{Jan Gebauer (1838–1907), scholar of the Czech language. \eds} with regard to Old Bohemian, but was made better known through Mourek's (\citeyear{mourek1902ueber}) work on negation in Middle High German % "(\textit{Königl. böhm. gesellschaft der wissenschaften} 1902)" moved out of body text
and has been faithfully repeated in the above-named (p.~\pageref{ch:preface}) works on Old English by \ia{Knörk, M.}\ia{Rauert, Matthäus}\ia{Einenkel, Eugen}Knörk, Rauert and Einenkel. These writers go back to \ia{Kant, Immanuel}Kant's %(\citeyear[\href{https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.149681/page/n99/mode/2up?q=\%22table+of+categories\%22}{B106}]{kant1787kritik}) %Brett: This is an English translation. I couldn't find the original.
table of categories, where the three categories of \textit{Position} (or \textit{Realität}), \textit{Negation}, \textit{Limitation} are ranged under the heading of \textit{Qualität}, while under the heading of \textit{Quantität} we find the three \textit{Einheit}, \textit{Vielheit}, \textit{Allheit} (`unity, plurality, totality'). % Peter: Better, I think, if both the three kinds of Qualität and the three kinds of Quantität were given in the single order German-then-English. The German terms for the former are Realität, Negation, Limitation; or anyway these are the three most conspicuous in Wikipedia (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(Kant) and https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie_(Philosophie)#Immanuel_Kant ); I'm not sure why "position".
%Brett: Not sure what you're suggesting, but I think it sounds OK.
% PE: I'm embarrassed to realize that I too can't work out what it was that I was suggesting. For now at least, leave as is.
This leads to the distinction between qualitative and quantitative negation; in the former the verb and by that means the whole sentence (\textit{die ganze Aussage}) is negatived, while in the latter only one part of the sentence is negatived. As examples of qualitative negation are given \textit{the man is not truly happy} and \textit{my guests have not arrived}; of quantitative negation \textit{no man is truly happy, the man is never truly happy, the man is nowhere truly happy} (I translate \textit{der Mensch} as \textit{the man}, though perhaps the generic \textit{man} is meant) and \textit{none of my guests have arrived, I see nowhere any of my guests}. Now the supposition is that language started by having qualitative and quantitative negation separately, and that later the combination of both was arrived at in some languages, such as Middle High German and Old English, and this is looked upon as representing a higher and more logical stage.

\begin{quote}
Diese Art der Negation beruht auf der rein logischen Forderung, dass, wenn ein Satzteil quantitativ verneint auftritt, der ganze Inhalt des Satzes qualitativ verneint wird: Dies sei an einem Beispiel verdeutlicht: \textit{ne mæg \il{English!Old English!nan@\textit{nan}}nan man twam hlafordum hieran}. In diesem Satz wird ausgesagt, dass kein mensch zwei herren zugleich dienen kann. Wenn sich nun kein Mensch findet, der 2 Herren zugleich dienen kann, so kann eben nicht mehr von einem `können', sondern logischerweise nur von einem \il{German!nicht@\textit{nicht}}`nicht können' die Rede sein, daher in dem angeführten Satz ganz richtig bei \textit{mæg} `ne' steht.

`This type of negation is based on the purely logical requirement that if a part of a sentence appears quantitatively negatived, the entire content of the sentence is qualitatively negatived. This is illustrated by an example: \textit{ne mæg \il{English!Old English!nan@\textit{nan}}nan man twam hlafordum hieran}. This sentence states that no person can serve two masters at the same time. If there is no person who can serve two masters at the same time, then there can no longer be talk of a `can', but logically only of a `can't', therefore in the sentence quoted, `ne' is quite correct with \textit{mæg}.'\hfill\citep[76]{rauert1910negation}

This should really be checked, etc, I (PE) suppose. In the interim, I've attempted to recapitalize, more or less guessing which words are "substantives". 
% PE: I don't understand "\textit{mæg} `ne' it is quite correct". Is what's meant perhaps "\textit{ne} is quite correct with \textit{mæg}"?
%Brett: Yes, thanks!
%PE: I have (unenthusiastically) changed "negated" to "negatived".

\emergencystretch=3em
To this line of reasoning several observations naturally offer themselves. Kant's table of categories is not unobjectionable, and in \chapref{ch:8} (p.~\pageref{08-better-tripartition}) % PE: OJ merely says in chapter VIII; no page number(s)
I shall venture to propose an improvement on the tripartition of \textit{Einheit}, \textit{Vielheit}, \textit{Allheit}. \ia{Kant, Immanuel}Kant does not look upon negation as sometimes qualitative and sometimes quantitative, but thinks it always qualitative. It would seem to be more logical to consider it as always quantitative; for even in such a simple sentence as \textit{he does not sleep} we indicate the amount of sleep he obtains, though it is true that the amount is \( = 0 \). The true distinction between the two kinds of sentences cited does not, then, depend on two kinds of negation, as this is everywhere the same, but on two kinds of ideas negatived. In the so-called ``qualitative'' negation the idea negatived is in itself non-quantitative, while in the other it is in itself quantitative, for \textit{none}, \textit{never} and \textit{nowhere} negative \textit{one} (or \textit{any}), \textit{ever}, and \textit{anywhere} respectively, and these are all quantitative terms. But however this may be, it is curious here to find that language ranged highest that explicitly indicates the negativity of the sentence; containing a quantitative negation (a negatived quantity); for if it is logically self-evident that such sentences are in themselves negative, why should it need to be expressed? And if some nations are praised because they have reached this high stage of logical development that they have understood the distinction between qualitative and quantitative negation and have been able to combine both, it seems rather sad that they should later on have lost that faculty, as the Germans and the English have (at any rate the educated classes), for they say \textit{kein Mensch kann zwei Herren dienen} and \textit{no man can serve two masters}. Cf. also Delbrück's (\citeyear[36 ff]{delbruck_negativen_1910}) criticism of the same theory from partly different points of view, which I need not repeat here. % Presumably D's Germanische Syntax 1. Zu den negativen Sätzen; but I (PE) haven't yet (May '24) found this on the web
\is{qualitative v. quantitative negation|)}

We note incidentally the curious fact that the ``logically highest'' standpoint in this theory is exactly the reverse of what it was in van Ginneken's.\ia{van Ginneken, Jacobus}

\is{redundancy of expression|(}
My own pet theory is that neither is right; logically one negative suffices, but two or three in the same sentence cannot be termed illogical; they are simply a redundancy, that may be superfluous from a stylistic point of view, just as any repetition in a positive sentence (\textit{every and any, always and on all occasions}, etc.), but is otherwise unobjectionable. Double negation arises because under the influence of a strong feeling the two tendencies specified above, one to attract the negative to the verb as nexal negative, and the other to prefix it to some other word capable of receiving this element, may both be gratified in the same sentence. But repeated negation seems to become a habitual phenomenon only in those languages in which the ordinary negative element is comparatively small in regard to phonetic bulk, as \il{English!Old English!ne@\textit{ne}}\textit{ne} and \textit{n-} in Old English and Russian, \il{German!Middle High German!en@\textit{en}}\textit{en} and \il{German!Middle High German!n-@\textit{n-}}\textit{n-} in Middle High German, \textit{on} (sounded \textit{u}) in Greek, \textit{s-} or \textit{n-} in Magyar. The insignificance of these elements makes it desirable to multiply them so as to prevent their being overlooked. Hence also the comparative infrequency of this repetition in English and German, after the fuller negatives \textit{not} and \il{German!nicht@\textit{nicht}}\textit{nicht} have been thoroughly established---though, as already stated, the logic of the schools and the influence of Latin has had some share in restricting the tendency to this particular kind of redundancy. It might, however, finally be said that it requires greater \is{mental energy for comprehension}mental energy to content oneself with one negative, which has to be remembered during the whole length of the utterance both by the speaker and by the hearer, than to repeat the negative idea (and have it repeated) whenever an occasion offers itself.

\AddSubSection{Resumptive negation}
\is{resumptive negation|(}
A second class comprises what may be termed \textsc{resumptive negation}, the characteristic of which is that after a negative sentence has been completed, something is added in a negative form with the obvious result that the negative effect is heightened. This is covered by Delbrück's expression ``Ergänzungsnegation'' (\citeyear[\href{https://archive.org/details/grundrissderver01delbgoog/page/534/mode/2up?view=theater\&q=\%22erg\%C3\%A4nzungsnegation\%22}{\S177}]{delbruck1897vergleichende}). In its pure form the supplementary negative is added outside the frame of the first sentence, generally as an afterthought, as in \textit{I shall never do it, not under any circumstances, not on any condition, neither at home nor abroad}, etc. A Danish example from Kierkegaard is \refp{ex:07-37}. But as no limits of sentences can be drawn with absolute certainty, the supplementary negative may be felt as belonging within the sentence, which accordingly comes to contain two negatives. This is the case in a popular Swedish idiom, in which the sentence begins and ends with \textit{inte}, as in \refp{ex:07-38}. Similarly in a Greek instance like \href{https://archive.org/details/homer-odyssey-loeb_202404/page/n85/mode/2up?q=%22+%CE%BF%E1%BD%90+%CE%B3%E1%BD%B0%CF%81+%E1%BD%80%CE%AF%CF%89+%CE%BF%E1%BD%94+%CF%83%CE%B5+%CE%B8%CE%B5%E1%BF%B6%CE%BD+%E1%BD%81+%E1%BC%80%CE%AD%CE%BA%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%B9+%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%AD%CF%83%CE%B8%CE%B1%CE%B9+%CF%84%CE%B5+%CF%84%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%86%CE%AD%CE%BC%CE%B5%CE%BD%22}{\textit{Odyssey} 3.27}, where the second \il{Greek!\textit{ou}}\textit{ou} might be placed between two commas: \textit{ou gàr oíō Oú se theôn aékēti genésthai te traphémen te} (`For I believe that neither of gods nor of men will he ever be born and raised'). On account of the difficulty of telling whether we have two sentences or a sentence with a tag it may sometimes be doubtful whether we have to do with this or the preceding class, as in \href{https://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/doc/AYL_F1/scene/2.4/index.html#tln-790}{Shakespeare, \textit{As You Like It} 2.4.8} \textit{I cannot goe no further}, which might be divided: \textit{I cannot go, no further}.

The most important instances of this class are those in which \textit{not} is followed by a disjunctive combination with \textit{neither {\dots} nor} or a restrictive addition with \textit{not even}: \refp{ex:07-40} etc. Cf. also \refp{ex:07-43}.

I am inclined to reckon among the cases of resumption (with the last negative originally outside the sentence) also the repetition \textit{it' ikke} or \textit{itik}, which in various phonetic forms is very frequent in Danish dialects (Seeland, % What is this?

%% SG: The word "nikke" 'nod' is a homonym, it has nothing to do with this "nikke", which is simply a kind of reduplication of "ikke" 
%% SG: note also that Pipmanden is not 'pipe man' (that would be "Pibemanden") but a nickname meaning something like 'tweet/chirp man' ("pip" is the sound a small bird makes) -- I am not sure how this is best translated into English, maybe just "Tweety"?

%% PE: The published translation ( https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/7795/pg7795-images.html ) has "Pipman". I've changed from "Tweety" to "Pipman"; less because the published translation uses it, more because these days "Tweety" jarringly brings to mind "tweets" (and "X", and Musk...).

\AddSubSection{Paratactic negation}
\is{paratactic negation|(}
\is{verbs of negative import|(}
\label{paratactic}Closely connected with resumptive negation is what might perhaps be termed \textsc{paratactic negation}: a negative is placed in a clause dependent on a verb of negative import like `deny, forbid, hinder, doubt'. The clause here is in some way treated as an independent sentence, and the negative is expressed as if there had been no main sentence of that particular kind. It is well known how this develops in some languages to a fixed rule, especially if the negative employed has no longer its full negative force: I need only very briefly refer, for instance, to the Latin use of \il{Latin!ne@\textit{ne}}\textit{ne}, \il{Latin!quin@\textit{quin}}\textit{quin}, \il{Latin!quominus@\textit{quominus}}\textit{quominus}, and to the French insertion of \il{French!ne@\textit{ne}}\textit{ne} (which, by the way, is now disappearing like the other \textit{ne}'s). But even in languages which do not as a rule admit a negative in such clauses, it is by no means rare even in good writers, though generally looked upon as an error by grammarians, see for English e.g. \refp{ex:07-67}.

What I (PE) read on pp 79-80 of P M Mitchell's A History of Danish Literature https://archive.org/details/historyofdanishl0000unse/page/n7/mode/2up suggests to me that this is not a work by anyone named Pedersen but is instead Holberg's pseudonymous work Peder Paars, which comprises four books, of which the first comprises five cantos. Book 1 canto 2 http://holbergsskrifter.dk/holberg-public/view?docId=Paars%2FPaars.page&brand=&chunk.id=book1song2&toc.id=book1&toc.depth=1 contains one token of "hindre" (within "forhindre"); book 1 canto 4 http://holbergsskrifter.dk/holberg-public/view?docId=Paars%2FPaars.page&brand=&chunk.id=book1song4&toc.id=book1&toc.depth=1 contains one of "hindre" (within "hindrer").

\is{conjunctions!negative|(}
\noindent This, of course, is illogical if analyzed with \textit{andet} as the sole object of \textit{nægte}: `one can deny nothing else except that she is sweet' but to the actual speech-instinct \textit{andet end {\dots} at hun} goes together as one indivisible whole constituting the object of \textit{nægte}; this is often marked by a pause before \textit{andet}, and \textit{andet-end-at} thus makes one negative conjunction comparable with Latin \il{Latin!quin@\textit{quin}}\textit{quin} or \il{Latin!quominus@\textit{quominus}}\textit{quominus}.

\il{Danish!ikke@\textit{ikke}}\il{Danish!langtfra@\textit{langtfra}|(}There is a curious use of a seemingly superfluous negative in Danish, which cannot be explained exactly in the same way as any of the phenomena hitherto dealt with, namely \textit{langtfra ikke} (`far from it', literally `far from not'), which used to be the regular idiom in phrases like \textit{hun er langtfra ikke så køn som søsteren} (`she is nowhere near as pretty as her sister') from the time of Holberg\footnote{Ludvig Holberg (1684--1754) was most active as a writer from the 1720s to the 1750s. \eds} till the middle of the 19th century, when it was superseded by \textit{langtfra} without \textit{ikke}: \textit{hun er langtfra så køn som søsteren}; English here has the positive form, but often inserts the verbal substantive in \textit{-ing}: \textit{she is far from being as pretty as her sister}. (English does not always require \textit{being} after \textit{far from}: \textit{she is far from pretty}.) \textit{Langtfra ikke} would be explicable as an instance of blending (contamination) if it could be proved that \textit{langtfra} was used as in recent times before the rise of \textit{langtfra ikke}, but I have no material to decide this question. (Cf. \cite{levin1861dagbladet}.) % I've trimmed from this the initial of the author's first name (which OJ strangely renders as "J" rather than "I") and the place and year of publication: details can be found in the bibliography.

\AddSubSection{Instances of confusion}
\is{confusion of negation|(}
I collect here several partly heterogeneous instances of confusion in negative sentences, which I have found some difficulty in placing, either in this or in any other chapter. Such confusion will occur frequently, especially if two or more negative or half-negative words are combined, but more frequently, of course, in everyday speech than in printed literature. Shakespeare, in accordance with the popular character of Elizabethan plays, destined to be heard much more than to be read, pretty frequently indulges in such carelessness (see \cite[\href{https://archive.org/details/shakespearelexic02schmuoft/page/1420/mode/2up?view=theater}{1420}]{schmidt1886}, \textit{Shakespeare-lexicon}), % ???

everything is correct, if we understand `you are \emph{still} less capable of valuing her than she is capable of scanting her duty'.

In \refp{ex:07-101}, some editors change \textit{if not} into \textit{if that}, but this is not at all necessary: the sentence is meant to be continued: \textit{if not these suffice}, or: \textit{are strong enough}, but is then continued in a different way, as is very often the case in everyday speech.

But Mikkelsen's description is not quite correct, and the real explanation evidently is that the writer begins his sentence with the intention of continuing it in a positive form (\textit{the envious, angry {\dots} all can be mollified}, etc.) and then suddenly changes the form of his expression. Nor is it necessary, as Mikkelsen says, to have a whole series of words, as seen in \refp{ex:07-113}. Cf. Danish \refp{ex:07-114}.

The confusion is somewhat similar to the one found when an enumeration of things that are wanting ends with \textit{no nothing} (\textit{no paper, no pen, no ink, no nothing}), which is meant as a negation of \textit{everything}: the origin of the phrase is, of course, to be explained from a desire to go on with \textit{no} + some other noun, but as the speaker can hit upon no more things to enumerate, he breaks off after \textit{no} and finishes with \textit{nothing}; \textit{no} thus is only seemingly an adjunct to \textit{nothing} \refp{ex:07-115}.

But it would certainly be unidiomatic to say, as \citet[\href{https://archive.org/details/miscellaneousre01whatgoog/page/n314/mode/2up?view=theater}{296}]{whately1866miscellaneous} demands, \textit{more than I can \textsc{not} help}; % Whately italicizes "not"; retaining this indication of stress seems helpful (even if OJ ignores it)
the idiom is caused by the fact that every comparison with \textit{than} really implies a negative idea (\textit{he has more than necessary} implies `it is not necessary to have more', etc.) and it is on a par with the logic that is shown, for instance, in the French use of \il{French!ne@\textit{ne}}\textit{ne} (\textit{plus qu'il ne faut}) and in the dialectal \textit{nor} for `than'.

But there is some difficulty in explaining this meaning of \textit{help}; note that where in England it is usual to say \textit{I could not help admiring her}, Americans will often prefer the negative expression with \textit{but}: \textit{I could not help but admire her}. \il{English!help@\textit{help}|)}
