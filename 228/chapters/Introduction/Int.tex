\section{Overview}
This book is about synchronic metathesis.
One well known case of synchronic metathesis comes
from Rotuman, in which many words have two forms,
such as \it{pu\tbr{re}} {\tl} \it{pu\tbr{er}} `rule, decide'
(\citealp[14]{ch40}, discussed in more detail in \srf{sec:Rot}).
In this book I present new data from Amarasi,
a language which also has synchronic metathesis.
Observe the natural textual data in \qf{ex:130902-1, 1.43 ch:Intr} below.

\begin{exe}
	\ex{Going to a party: \txrf{130902-1, 1.43}{\emb{130902-1-01-43.mp3}{\spk{}}{\apl}}}\label{ex:130902-1, 1.43 ch:Intr}
	\begin{xlist}
		\ex{\gll	oras hai m-nao =te, \\
							time {\hai} {\m}-go ={\te}\\
				\glt	`While we were going,' \txrf{}}
		\ex{\gll	naiʔ Owen ina ʔpiurʔ=ee n-mo\tbr{uf}, n-mo\tbr{fu} =ma na-mneuk.\\
							{\naiq} Owen {\iin} cloth={\ee} {\n}-fall {\n}-fall =and {\na}-lose\\
				\glt	`Owen's handkerchief fell, it fell and was lost.'}
	\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

The metathesis of Amarasi \ve{mofu} {\tl} \ve{mouf} `fall'
in \qf{ex:130902-1, 1.43 ch:Intr} is formally almost identical to Rotuman
metathesis in examples such as \it{pure} {\tl} \it{puer} `rule, decide'.
In each case the final CV sequence of a CVCV stem metathesises to VC,
as illustrated in \qf{as:Metathesis} below with
the architecture of Autosegmental Phonology \citep{go76}.

Synchronic metathesis in Amarasi is phonologically very similar
to previously described cases in other languages.
Furthermore, in certain environments the phonology alone
determines whether the metathesised or unmetathesised
form of a word will appear in Amarasi.
However, phonology alone cannot predict that reversal of the position of the
metathesised and unmetathesised words in \qf{ex:130902-1, 1.43 ch:Intr}
produces a sentence judged ungrammatical by native speakers,
as shown in \qf{ex:el. 22/02/16 p.19}.

\begin{exe}
	\ex[*]{\gll	naiʔ Owen ina ʔpiurʔ=ee n-mo\tbr{fu}, n-mo\tbr{uf} =ma na-mneuk.\\
						{\naiq} Owen {\iin} cloth={\ee} {\n}-fall {\n}-fall =and {\na}-lose\\
			\glt	`(Owen's handkerchief fell, it fell and was lost.)' \txrf{elicit. 22/02/16 p.19}
			}\label{ex:el. 22/02/16 p.19}
\end{exe}

The forms of synchronic metathesis in several languages have been well described.
This has lead to much useful discussion about the kinds
of phonological models which best handle metathesis,
as found in works including
\cite{be87,huen95,hu98,huse04,hu04}, and \cite{he04}, among others.

Despite this interest in the form of synchronic metathesis,
there has been relatively little attention given to
the functions of synchronic metathesis
and the different environments in which an unmetathesised
or metathesised form of a word is used.
This work partially redresses this imbalance.
I provide a detailed analysis of the functions and
environments of synchronic metathesis in Amarasi.
This includes one instance of phonologically conditioned metathesis
and two different morphological uses of metathesis,
neither of which can be reduced to a phonologically conditioned process.

I begin in Chapter \ref{ch:SynchMet} with a discussion
of processes of synchronic metathesis in languages of the world.
The focus in this chapter is on languages spoken in the same region
as Amarasi, particularly languages with morphological metathesis.
There are many similarities in both the form and use of metathesis in these languages.
Chapter \ref{ch:SynchMet} allows me to position the Amarasi
data within its geographic and typological context.

After a discussion of Amarasi phonology and phonotactics
in Chapter \ref{ch:AmaPho}, in Chapter \ref{ch:StrMetAma}
I provide a detailed investigation of the form of metathesis in Amarasi.
Depending on the phonotactic structure of the stem to which it applies,
metathesis is associated with a bewildering
array of disparate phonological processes including
vowel deletion, consonant deletion, consonant insertion,
and multiple kinds of vowel assimilation.
All these phonological processes
can be derived from a single process of metathesis and
one associated morphemically conditioned process
by proposing that Amarasi has an obligatory
CVCVC foot in which C-slots can be empty.

The structure of the words \ve{fatu} `stone', \ve{kaut} `papaya' and \ve{ai} `fire'
under this analysis are given in \qf{as:fatu/kaut/ai ch:Int} below.
Evidence independent of metathesis for empty C-slots in Amarasi 
is presented in (\srf{sec:EmpCSlo}).
Such evidence consists of five language-internal
phenomena as well as comparative data.

The presence of phonological processes in addition to metathesis
leads me to label forms corresponding to unmetathesised forms as \emph{U\=/forms}
and those corresponding to metathesised forms as \emph{M\=/forms}.\footnote{
		The terms U\=/form and M\=/form can be taken as abbreviations for the form
		where \emph{U} stands for \emph{unmetathesised} and \emph{M} for \emph{metathesised}.
		They can also be taken as abbreviations for the functions of these forms,
		as in the syntax M\=/forms mark \emph{\tbf{m}odification}
		and in the discourse U\=/forms mark \emph{\tbf{u}nresolved} events or situations.
		The \emph{U} in U\=/form can also be an abbreviation for
		the morphologically \emph{\tbf{u}nderlying} form.}

In Chapter \ref{ch:PhoMet} I analyse phonologically conditioned metathesis in Amarasi.
Before vowel-initial enclitics, metathesis occurs
to clearly mark a phonological boundary between
a clitic host and vowel-initial enclitic.
The final consonant of a clitic host is shared between the host and clitic.
Metathesis creates a final consonant cluster which is resolved
by the final consonant de-linking from the clitic host but remaining linked to the enclitic,
thus creating a crisp edge between the host and enclitic.

In chapters \ref{ch:SynMet} and \ref{ch:DisMet}
I provide detailed analyses of morphological metathesis in Amarasi.
Amarasi has two morphological uses of metathesis:
one taken by medial members of phrases (noun phrases or verb phrases)
to mark the internal syntactic structure of the phrase
and one taken by final members of phrases
which marks discourse structures.
These two morphological uses of metathesis
occur in complementary environments:
phrase medial and phrase final.
As a result there is no competition
between each morphological use of metathesis
and no direct structural interaction between them.
A single sentence may contain both types of morphological
metathesis with the medial members of a particular
phrase expressing the internal syntax of this phrase
and the final member using metathesis to 
mark the discourse status of the phrase.

In Chapter \ref{ch:SynMet} I provide a detailed analysis of Amarasi metathesis within the syntax.
In the syntax metathesis is a morphological process
taken by medial members of a phrase to signal attributive modification.
Metathesis is a construct form which marks the presence of a dependent
modifier of the same word class as the head, as illustrated in \qf{ex:Fatu+Koqu2} below.
Metathesis alone distinguishes attributive phrases from
phrases with a different syntactic structure, such as equative clauses,
illustrated in \qf{ex:Fatu+Koqu1} below.
Within the syntax a metathesised form cannot occur at the end of a phrase
and thus usually entails the presence of an unmetathesised form which syntactically completes it.
Metathesised and unmetathesised forms comprise a parallel
and complementary pair of morphological forms within the syntax.

			\end{xlist}
		}\label{ex:Fatu+Koqu}
	\end{exe}
\end{multicols}

In Chapter \ref{ch:DisMet} I provide a detailed analysis of Amarasi metathesis within the discourse.
In the discourse an unmetathesised phrase-final form marks an unresolved event or situation
which requires another phrase or clause to achieve resolution.
This is the use of metathesis illustrated in \qf{ex:130902-1, 1.43 ch:Intr} above.
A discourse-driven unmetathesised form cannot occur in isolation
and typically requires a metathesised form to achieve resolution.
Unmetathesised and metathesised forms comprise a complementary and
parallel pair of morphological forms within the discourse.

I conclude in Chapter \ref{ch:ConCon} with a unified analysis Amarasi metathesis.
Metathesis in Amarasi is not merely a phonological epiphenomenon or exotic curiosity.
Rather, metathesis is the key which unlocks the structure and genius of the Amarasi language.
Metathesis also reflects fundamental Timorese notions of societal and cosmic organisation.
Metathesis is one marker of identity in a region obsessed with marking multiple
levels of identity between different groups.

The complementarity of metathesis and unmetathesis within the syntax and that within discourse
-- and also cross-cutting discourse and syntax --
reflects the Timorese division of the world into a series of parallel and complementary pairs.
More than simply being the key which unlocks the structure of the language,
metathesis is a deep reflection of the structure of Amarasi society and culture.

This book also contains four appendices.
Appendix \ref{ch:MorphSketch} provides a sketch of affixal morphology in Amarasi.
Appendix \ref{app:MorMet} discusses cases of morphological metathesis
in languages outside of the greater Timor region.
Appendix \ref{app:SelAmaTex} provides four complete
glossed Amarasi texts of different genres:
one historical narrative, one myth, one conversation
and one Ro{\Q}is Amarasi narrative.
These three texts allow the reader to see
how metathesis operates across a complete text.
Appendix D
% \ref{app:TexInd}
provides information and metadata
on the texts referred to throughout this book,
as discussed further in \srf{sec:PreDat} below.
