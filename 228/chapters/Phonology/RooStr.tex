\section{Root structure}\label{sec:RooStr}
Amarasi roots have a highly constrained phonotactic structure.
Lexical roots are minimally composed of the CVCVC foot (\srf{sec:TheFoo}).
However, functors are not necessarily composed of a foot,
with 28 out of 64 functors in my corpus
currently analysed as monosyllabic.

A lexical root in Amarasi is minimally composed of the CVCVC foot.
This foot can optionally be preceded by another foot,
a CVC syllable or a single consonant.
This root structure is given in \qf{ex:Root->SFt} below.

\begin{exe}
	\ex{Lexical Root {\ra}
			{$\left\{\hspace{-2mm}\begin{array}{c}
				\textrm{\0}\\
				\textrm{C}\\
				\textrm{Ïƒ}\\
				\textrm{Ft}
			\end{array}\hspace{-2mm}\right\}$}
	Ft}\label{ex:Root->SFt}
\end{exe}

In my current corpus, 64{\%} (1,223/1,913) of lexical roots are a single foot,
21{\%} (401) consist of a single foot preceded by an additional consonant,
9{\%} (178) consist of a foot preceded by a syllable, and 6{\%} (106) consist of two feet.
Five words have an exceptional structure.
