\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Int}
In this chapter I describe and analyse the form of metathesis in Amarasi.
At its most simple, metathesis involves the
reversal of the final consonant-vowel sequence of a word.
One example is the word `stone' which has the unmetathesised form
\ve{fa\tbr{tu}} [ˈfat̪ʊ] and the metathesised form \ve{fa\tbr{ut}} [ˈfa.ʊt̪].
This example shows the pattern C\sub{1}V\sub{2}C\sub{3}V\sub{4}
{\ra} C\sub{1}V\sub{2}V\sub{4}C\sub{3},
illustrated in \qf{as:fatu->faut} below.

Metathesis is mostly straightforward with words
that instantiate all and only CVCV.
However, words with other shapes also occur in Amarasi (\srf{sec:RooStr}).
Depending on the phonotactic structure of the word,
metathesis is associated with other phonological processes, including
vowel deletion, consonant deletion, and two kinds of vowel assimilation.
These different processes are illustrated in Table \ref{tab:PhoProAssMetAma}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering\caption{Phonological processes associated with metathesis}\label{tab:PhoProAssMetAma}

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

From the examples in Table \ref{tab:PhoProAssMetAma}, 
it is clear that many of the forms before
and after the arrow do not differ only
in the order of the final CV sequence.
This is the reason for referring to forms
paradigmatically equivalent to \ve{fatu} `stone'
as the `U\=/form' and forms paradigmatically
equivalent to \ve{faut} `stone' as the `M\=/form'.

By positing an obligatory CVCVC foot
in which C-slots can be empty,
under a process-based model of morphology
and an autosegmental model of phonology,
all the phonological processes
in the formation of the M\=/form arise
from a single rule of metathesis at the CV tier,
an associated morphemically conditioned rule,
and the general phonotactic constraints of Amarasi.
This analysis is superior to alternate analyses
under different frameworks, such as prosodic morphology,
or purely concatenative morphology,
which cannot account for all the data
in a consistent, typologically plausible manner.

For some word shapes it is possible to identify
formally distinct M\=/forms which occur in different environments.
The distribution of each of these three M\=/forms
is summarised in \trf{tab:MfoMuqAni}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\caption{M\=/forms of \ve{muʔit} `animal' and \ve{fatu} `stone'}\label{tab:MfoMuqAni}
		\begin{tabular}{lcllll} \lsptoprule
			U\=/form		&		&	M\=/forms			& gloss	& environments 										&\\ \midrule
			\ve{muʔit}&\ra&	\ve{muiʔ}		&	{\M}	& (C)V-initial nominal modifiers,	&\srf{sec:BasMfo}\\
			\ve{fatu}	&		&	\ve{faut}		& 			&default verbal form							&\\

\end{table}

Firstly, there is the basic M\=/form which is the form
taken by nouns when modified by another nominal
and which is also the default form of vowel-final verbs.
Examples include \ve{fa\tbr{tu}} {\ra} \ve{fa\tbr{ut}} `stone'
and \ve{mu\tbr{ʔit}} {\ra} \ve{mu\tbr{iʔ}} `animal'.
Basic M\=/forms are indicated with the gloss `{\M}'.
Their structure is discussed in \srf{sec:BasMfo}.

Secondly, there is an M\=/form taken by nominals
when modified by a word with an initial consonant cluster.
One example is \ve{muʔi\tbr{t}} {\ra} \ve{muʔi} `animal'.
These \mbox{M\=/forms} are indicated with the gloss {\Mc}.
Their structure is discussed in \srf{sec:CCIniMod}.

Thirdly, there is an M\=/form taken by all words before vowel-initial enclitics.
Examples include \ve{fa\tbr{tu}} {\ra} \ve{fa\tbr{atgw}} `stone'
and \ve{mu\tbr{ʔi}t} {\ra} \ve{mu\tbr{iʔ}t} `animal'.
M\=/forms before enclitics are indicated with the gloss {\Mv}.
Unlike the other M\=/forms, M\=/forms used before enclitics
can be analysed as purely phonologically conditioned
and their structure is described and analysed in Chapter \ref{ch:PhoMet}.

The M\=/forms discussed in this chapter
are the M\=/forms with a morphological use:
the basic M\=/form ({\M}) and the {\MC}-form
used before attributive modifiers with an initial consonant cluster.

While these two forms occur in
different phonological environments,
this does not mean that the use of these forms
is triggered by these environments.
Instead, which form is used is triggered
by syntactic or discourse factors.
An analogy is the English verbal third person singular agreement suffix \it{-s}.
This suffix has three forms /əz/, /z/ and /s/,
each of which is used in different environments.
When the English \tsc{3sg} agreement suffix occurs,
it has different forms as determined by its phonological environment.
However, it is not these phonological environments
which determine whether this suffix occurs or not;
instead, morphosyntactic factors determine this.

While the focus in this chapter is on the structure
of metathesis in Kotos Amarasi as spoken in Nekmese{\Q} by
inhabitants of the old hamlet of Koro{\Q}oto, I provide
comparative data from other varieties of Meto when they are
known to differ from Kotos Amarasi.
