In particular, it has been claimed that subject-like obliques in Icelandic behave as syntactic subjects, while in German they behave as syntactic objects. Verb agreement and occurrences with expletives appear to support a non-subject analysis of German obliques. However, with respect to relexivization, conjunction reduction and control infinitives, German obliques behave like syntactic subjects. On this basis, it will be argued that German obliques are indeed syntactic subjects, just as in Icelandic and Faroese. Adapted from the source document},

Phonaesthemes are well-represented sound-meaning pairings, such as English gl-, which occurs in numerous words with meanings relating to light and vision. In the experiment, phonaesthemes, despite being noncompositional in nature, displayed priming effects much like those that have been reported for compositional morphemes. These effects could not be explained as the result of semantic or phonological priming, either alone or in combination. The results support a view of the lexicon in which shared form and meaning across words is a key factor in their relatedness, and in which morphological composition is not required for internal word structure to play a role in language processing},

  abstract = {This paper argues that the term "dative subjects" has been applied to two distinct constructions. In one, the surface subject is in the dative case. In the other, a dative-marked nominal that behaves like a subject in certain respects is not, it is claimed here, a surface subject. Dative nominals of the second type have been analyzed in relational grammar as initial subject & final indirect object in the inversion construction (I-nominals). Neither adopting nor rejecting the initial-subject analysis of I-nominals, it is argued only that they are not surface subjects. Russian is shown to have a true dative-subject construction in which surface subjects are in the dative case. Russian also has I-nominals in the dative case which behave like subjects in only two respects; in other respects they fail to behave like subjects. This failure cannot be attributed to their dative case because true dative subjects, also in the dative case, behave like subjects in every respect. It is concluded that dative subjects & I-nominals instantiate distinct constructions which must be recognized as such in syntactic typology & syntactic theory. The implications of this result for the analysis of other languages are discussed. 68 . Adapted from the source document},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether "main clause infinitival datives" in Russian should be analyzed as oblique or "quirky" subjects, in contrast to another type of subject-like dative in Russian, "I-nominals." In particular, it examines a claim to this effect made by Moore & Perlmutter (2000). By comparing the datives in question to Icelandic oblique subjects (above all with respect to agreement), the paper demonstrates that Moore & Perlmutters arguments are untenable, ie, their arguments do not distinguish between the two dative types in the way they claim. However, it does not follow that Russian infinitival datives are best analyzed as "non-subjects." Rather, it is argued, the interesting question raised by subject-like non-nominatives across languages is not whether they should be classified as subjects by some postulated standards, but what they tell us about the interaction of case & other features or properties of language, in particular sentence structure & agreement. The concluding section of the paper presents evidence that Russian I-nominals differ from Icelandic quirky subjects in not entering into a "quirky null-agreement" correlation with the finite complex of the clause. In contrast, it is pointed out, Russian infinitival datives could & probably should be analyzed as sharing this peculiar property with Icelandic "quirks." 44 . Adapted from the source document},

The latter approach is supported here on the basis of data from Icelandic. This approach provides a good account of data from languages such as German, on the basis of which the case marking analysis was initially developed. In fact, differences between the two languages can be accounted for in this model by a single lang-specific association convention for each lang. 65 . B. Annesser Murray},
