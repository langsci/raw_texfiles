\BackBody{The original edition of this work attempted to cover the
  main lines of development of phonological theory from the end of the
  19th century through the early 1980s. Much work of importance, both
  theoretical and historiographic, has appeared in subsequent years, and
  the present edition tries to bring the story up to the end of the
  20th century, as the title promised. This has involved an overall
  editing of the text, in the process correcting some errors of fact
  and interpretation, as well as the addition of some new material and
  a number of new
  references.
