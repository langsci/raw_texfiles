This book is based on my doctoral thesis, which would not have been completed without the help of many friends, colleagues, and collaborators.

First and foremost, I would like to thank the entire Tsova-Tush community in Zemo Alvani for hosting me and allowing me to investigate their precious and complicated language. My warmest thanks goes out to Rezo Orbetishvili and Nisa Bakhtarishvili for taking me in, introducing me to the community, feeding me copious meals, and treating me like a family member. I also thank Dantes Echishvili and Rezo Shankishvili for their collaboration and their kind heart.

I sincerely thank my supervisor Gilles Authier for introducing me to minority languages of the Caucasus, for being patient with my slow writing, and for hosting me in Paris so many times, to the point that I think I have lived there for several years now. Several other people have invested in me in terms of supervision and guidance. A huge thank you to Monika Rind-Pawlowski, for close-reading my work several times, but equally importantly for her friendship and the Wohnmobil adventures. Thank you to Gerd Carling for stepping in at the last moment, and for exchanging stories of adapting to the German bureaucratic system. A heartfelt thank you to Jost Gippert, who had no obligation to help me, but still provided crucial pointers, suggestions and nudges in the right direction.

A huge thank you to my two friends and fellow PhD candidates, Max Ionov and Hasmik Sargsyan. We had an intense and turbulent time in Frankfurt, and I thank you for the late nights, the heartfelt conversations and the amazing banter. Max, thank you so much for our friendship and for all of the adventures we undertook.

I want to thank my fellow young researchers of Tsova-Tush, Diana Kakashvili, Bryn Hauk and Felix Anker. We were never all in the same place at the same time, but it did feel like our own little community, and I have fond memories of our email conversations and occasional live meet-ups. Thank you, Diana, for always being ready to discuss anything from Tsova-Tush grammar to Georgian university politics and thank you for our amazing trip to Dadaloba.

A big thank you to the community of Caucasologists that I got to be a part of. I thank both the more established members, Timur Maisak, Johanna Nichols, Alice Harris, Diana Forker, Nina Sumbatova, Nina Dobrushina, Misha Daniel, Nino Amiridze, Léa Nash and Donald Rayfield, for their guidance and inclusion, as well as the (slightly) more junior scholars (some of whom are also quite established), Samira Verhees, Neige Rochant, Steven Kaye, Jérémy Pasquereau, Ayten Babaliyeva, Kristian Roncero, Garik Moroz, Gasik Sulaibanov, Murad Suleymanov, Thomas Wier, Zurab Baratashvili and Hélène Gerardin, for our fruitful discussions, and for simply being great people.

This thesis was written over the course of seven years at various institutes and institutions. I want to sincerely thank my colleagues for creating a great work environment: Christian Fäth, Kathrin Donandt, Frank Abromeit, Ilya Khait and Jutta Nadland at the Goethe University Frankfurt's Institut für Informatik; Manana Tandaschwili, Zakaria Pourtskhvanidze, Armin Hoenen, Silvie Strauß, Emine Tsoritæ Şahingöz, Mariam Kamarauli and Peter Sauer at the Frankfurt Institut für Empirische Sprachwissenschaft; Sjoerd-Jeroen Moenander, Joana Duarte, Flávio Eiró, Anne Merkuur, Maria Mazzoli and Ruby de Vos at the University of Groningen's programme Minorities \& Multilingualism; Sasha Lubotsky, Alwin Kloekhorst, Michaël Peyrot, Tijmen Pronk, Lucien van Beek, Guus Kroonen, Mariam Klamer, Maarten Mous, Maarten Kossmann, Lisa Cheng, Egbert Fortuin, and the entire lunch bunch at the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics. I also thank the students who attended my courses on Tsova-Tush and Georgian in Frankfurt, Paris and Leiden, for their insightful comments. I want to sincerely thank my teachers of Georgian and Kartvelology, Tamar Makharoblidze, Ramaz Kurdadze, Giuli Shabashvili, Ketevan Gochitashvili, Tinatin Bolkvadze, Ketevan Margiani and Maia Lomia.

I thank all members of my defence committee for their scrutiny and their pertinent questions: Jost Gippert, Viola Hildebrand-Schat, Guillaume Jacques, Manana Tandaschwili, and Karina Vamling. I want to thank Murad Suleymanov and Enrique Palancar for graciously being members of my \textit{comité de suivi}; Yaron Matras, for the stimulating conversations and for giving me insightful pointers into the language contact literature; and Kate Bellamy for her broad knowledge and great friendship. A huge thanks to Diana Kakashvili for translating the summary into Georgian. Many thanks also to Sebastian Nordhoff and Felix Kopecky of Language Science Press, as well as the the series editors of LSP Languages of the Caucasus, and to two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful and valuable commentary.

Last but not least I want to thank Japke de Ru, an amazing, brave and kind woman from the city of Leiden, who luckily came up with the great idea to spend the rest of our lives together. Thank you for your patience, your love and your insights into myself. 


I dedicate this work to little Mira.
