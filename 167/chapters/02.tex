\abstract{Elder Kotiria woman Teresinha Marques recounts the mythological origin of the Kotiria sacred cemeteries. It begins with a dispute among sibs sparked by Ñahori’s theft of a woman promised in marriage to younger brother Yuhpi Diane. Ñahori is killed, and members of his group seek to avenge his death, waging a three-day battle. Older brother Diane, who had warned Ñahori against taking the woman in the first place, views the terrible consequences of this failure to obey social norms—with sibs divided and warring against each other—and decides to remove himself to another world, taking with him sacred instruments, adornments, and knowledge. The place where he enters into the ground becomes a burial site for his own descendants, and separate cemeteries are established for the descendants of other sibs, now as divided in death as they had become in life.}
