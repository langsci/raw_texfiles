Three arguments are presented: (i) English \emph{whether/Q...or} questions present at the same time movement characteristics (sensitivity to islands) and ellipsis traits (focus pattern on the disjuncts); (ii) crosslinguistic data on the surface string syntax of Subject-Object-Verb languages support the ellipsis plus movement account in general and, thus, indirectly also for English; and (iiii) certain asymmetries between \emph{whether/Q...or }and \emph{either...or} are resolved, permitting a unified account of the two types of constructions.},

	abstract = {Since the earliest days of generative grammar, control has been distinguished from raising: the latter the product of movement operations, the former the result of construal processes relating a PRO to an antecedent. This article argues that obligatory control structures are also formed by movement. Minimalism makes this approach viable by removing D-Structure as a grammatical level. Implementing the suggestion, however, requires eliminating the last vestiges of D-Structure still extant in Chomsky's (1995) version of the Minimalist Program. In particular, it requires dispensing with the θ-Criterion and adopting the view that θ-roles are featurelike in being able to license movement.},

I compare Chomsky's three successive theories of strong features and argue that two ellipsis phenomena, pseudogapping and sluicing, provide evidence bearing on the nature of strong features. I argue that movement or ellipsis can rescue a derivation with a strong feature, and I conclude that PF crash is relevant either directly, as in Chomsky 1993, or indirectly, as in the theory presented in Chomsky 1995a augmented by the multiple-chain theory of pied-piping (especially as interpreted by Ochi (1998)).},
