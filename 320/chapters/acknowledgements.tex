\addchap{Acknowledgements}
Development of the ideas presented here has spanned almost two decades; we are grateful for so many interesting discussions throughout these years that have advanced our thinking -- discussions with students and colleagues  at the Universities of Arizona, British Columbia, and Hong Kong, discussions at various conferences, as well as at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford (Diana, 2007â€“2008), Linguistic Society of American Summer Institute at the University of Colorado in Boulder (both of us, 2011), African Linguistics School (Doug, 2013, 2016, 2019), and the Crete Summer School of Linguistics (Doug, 2017, 2018, 2019).

We thank our families for encouraging and putting up with us in so many ways as we worked on this project. We dedicate this book to them:\smallskip\\
