%\section{Acknowledgements}

This book is based on my habilitation thesis conducted in the course of my post-doctoral position at the Osnabrück University (2015--2020). I am profoundly grateful to many people for their constant support throughout this research process.


First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge with gratitude the support of my supervisors, Trudel Meisenburg and Laura Colantoni, who, while always showing confidence in my work, never stopped helping, challenging and sharing their ideas with me. I enjoyed all discussions and time with them! I also thank Frank Kügler for his interest, support and willingness to review my study -- this all happened at a coffee break at the ICPhS\,2019 in Melbourne and I was very happy to get him on board.



This work would have never been published without the interest and support of the editors of the series Open Romance Linguistics in Language Science Press (LSP). I am especially thankful to Lorenzo Filipponio for his advice, patience and availability, and two peer reviewers for their insightful comments and very valuable suggestions that helped to improve the manuscript.



In the Czech Republic, I thank Kamil Gregůrek and Language School \textit{Hispánica} in Brno, \textit{Instituto Cervantes} in Prague, Štěpánka Černikovská and Jan Chromý from the Faculty of Arts at Charles University in Prague and Paolo Divizia from the Faculty of Arts at Masaryk University in Brno for helping me to recruit and organise participants in my experiments. I am also very grateful to Marek Stehlík from the Faculty of Informatics at Masaryk University in Brno and Filip Smolík from the Laboratory of Behavioral and Linguistic Studies (LABELS) in Prague for giving me the opportunity to run my experiments in their departments.



Furthermore, I thank my colleagues in Germany and elsewhere, among them Bistra Andreeva, Stefan Baumann, Ariadna Benet, Susana Cortés, Elisabeth De\-lais-Rous\-sa\-rie, Yves D’hulst, Gorka Elordieta, Wendy Elvira-García, Ingo Feldhausen, Christoph Gabriel, Fatima Hamlaoui, Sun-Ah Jun, Ina Lehmkuhle, Ineke Mennen, Nathalie Nicolay, Francesca Nicora, Katharina Nimz, Pekka Posio, Pilar Prieto, Karin Puga, Uli Reich, Valentin Rose, Paolo Roseano, Fabian Santiago, Karsten Schmidt, Rolf Schöneich, Raphaël Sichel-Bazin, Johanna Stahnke, Maria del Mar Vanrell, Meg Zellers, and Marzena Żygis, for their help, discussions and/or valuable feedback at different conferences and at different stages of the project. 



A special word of gratitude goes to Michael Kennedy-Scanlon, Dale Bruton and LSP community for English proofreading as well as to my students Ron Gerstmann, Laura Strokorb and Belén María Viñas Fernández for orthographic transcriptions of the data and to Luisa Sprehe and Roxanne Krüger for carefully checking the bibliography. I am also grateful to all the motivated and patient speakers who participated in my study, without whom this work would never have been possible.



Last but not least, I thank my husband Jordan, my family and all my friends for always being there and for having kept me going.
