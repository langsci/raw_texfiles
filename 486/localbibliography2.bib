These can create derived verb stems that show the syntax and semantics that are associated with those terms. Background information on the Bantu verb stem is provided in the second section, while the third section features a simpler morphological irregularity found in the verb stem. The chapter also discusses morphological mismatches in the verb stem and various classes of deponent verb stems.}},
