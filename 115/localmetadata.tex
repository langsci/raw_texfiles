\BackBody{This book reconsiders the role of order and structure in syntax, focusing on fundamental issues such as word order and grammatical functions. The papers in the collection all address the issue of subjecthood and argument structure in some way, and examine how certain subject properties vary across languages: expression of subjects, expletive subjects, quirky and locative subjects. All of the papers address in some way the tension between modelling what can vary across languages whilst improving our understanding of what might be universal to human language.
