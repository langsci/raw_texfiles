\noindent The spirit of \textit{toto} bamboo wanted to get married, so he asked for a wife. He called on his father's sister. ``Aunt, I want to marry your daughter. I don't have anyone to cook my food, and my manioc is sitting in the field without being grated.''
 
\noindent Then the girl's father came home. ``Your nephew asked for your daughter. He's standing there.''
 
\noindent ``Did he really ask for my daughter? Let him take my daughter.'' So he gave away his daughter, but she didn't have any children.
 
\noindent The spirit of \textit{toto} went to his own home. He arrived. His new wife toasted manioc mash. Then they ate, but she didn't eat again.

\noindent The two of them slept. He didn't sleep in the same hammock with her. He just lay beside her hammock in his. He didn't want to have sex with her.
 
\noindent ``My manioc mash is all gone. I want you to pull up some manioc. Then you grate the manioc, too. When the manioc is grated, there will be a lot of manioc mash.''
 
\noindent So she pulled up manioc. She carried the manioc. She peeled the manioc, which became the starch eaten with herself. She made the starch that was eaten with herself. She grated the manioc. When the manioc was finished being grated, she put the manioc through the sieve. The manioc was finished being put through the sieve.
 
\noindent ``Toto Abono,\footnote{Presumably, the girl did not know her husband was really a spirit, so in this case Toto Abono is a proper name.} aren't you a fisherman?''
 
\noindent ``I don't have any arrows to spear fish with. The fish are there in the water, but I don't have any arrows. Because I don't have any equipment, I am always hungry.''
 
\noindent So the \textit{toto} spirit didn't go fishing. She pestered him. She ate manioc meal by itself. ``I don't want to eat manioc meal by itself.'' She ate manioc meal by itself, before the two of them slept. She slept.
 
\noindent When the sun was this high, the \textit{hato} spirit had cut firewood. He had put the firewood in a pile. He was planning to kill his bride, who he had brought.
 
\noindent While she was sleeping, he hit her on the head, at dawn. She died.
 
\noindent He got up early. He cut her up in the morning. He ate her in the morning. He roasted her. After he roasted her, he ate her. He ate her with the starch that she herself had grated.
 
\noindent When he was done eating his wife, he decided to leave. He was hungry. He went back to his mother-in-law. He arrived.
 
\noindent ``Aha, there comes your older sister's husband.''
 
\noindent ``Whew, I have come back. Whew, my wife called for you. I came because she told me to, so you can grate manioc together.''
 
\noindent ``I guess my daughter is tired, because she is grating manioc.''
 
\noindent ``She wants you to grate manioc together. I have come because she told me to.''
 
\noindent ``You take them. Let the two of them be together again.''
 
\noindent He got ready to leave. ``Mother-in-law, I'm going. Let your other daughter go back with me, to help her older sister, so they will grate manioc together.''
 
\noindent She agreed. ``You go back with your older sister's husband. The two of you go. You stay with your older sister.'''
 
\noindent So he took her. He went back. He disappeared into the forest.
 
\noindent ``He said my daughter is grating manioc, and now Toto Abono has taken her younger sister, too, because he said she is tired.''
 
\noindent The two of them arrived. He was married, but he didn't have sex with his wives. He was carrying them off and eating them. He ate them. He killed her, also. He ate her. After he finished eating her, his manioc meal ran out.

\noindent ``Whew, I don't have any more manioc meal. The manioc meal is all gone. I'll go get someone to grate manioc meal.''
 
\noindent She died. He ate her. He hit her on the head. He strangled her as she slept in her hammock. He killed her. He cut her up in the morning. Then he roasted her. He ate her belly. After he ate, he lay in his hammock during the day.
 
\noindent ``Oh, my meat. Oh, I need to roast my meat some more.'' So he roasted her. He ate her all day. He ate more of her the next day again. He ate another piece the next day again, and then she was all gone. He was done eating her.
 
\noindent Then he went back again. ``I'm going to go after them, others of them, for them to grate manioc for me.'' He went after his father-in-law's daughters, for them to grate manioc. He went and asked for others.
 
\noindent ``Look, Toto Abono has come again.''
 
\noindent ``Whew!  I have come back. They keep pestering me. I came again because they told me to. `Let's all process manioc together. We will all process manioc. Go get our younger sisters,' they said. I have come because they told me to.''
 
\noindent There were two of them. He took the two of them.

\noindent ``You will peel your sisters' manioc. You squeeze the poison juice out of more manioc. Don't just look at each other. My daughters must be tired.''
 
\noindent ``They are tired and they don't stop pestering me. I came because they told me to. It wasn't my idea to come.''
 
\noindent So he went home. They arrived when the sun was this high.
 
\noindent ``Whew! I'm going to get myself some firewood. I didn't realize I had no firewood.'' He was planning to kill them, too.
 
\noindent ``Where are my older sisters? They must have gone out to pull up manioc. Sister, sister.''  They called their older sisters, calling, ``Sister.''
 
\noindent Their older sisters didn't call out. They looked around. They looped around. Their sisters' skulls had been strung with a line of inner bark, and were hanging on the split \textit{basioba} palm wall. They found their skulls.
 
\noindent ``Hato Abono has been eating my older sisters.''
 
\noindent The sound of him cutting firewood could be heard in the distance, \textit{teo}, \textit{teo}, \textit{teo}, \textit{teo}.
 
\noindent ``Sister, let's go.'' So they got ready to go, quickly grabbing their rolled-up hammocks. They went running away because they had seen their sisters' skulls.
 
\noindent He came back carrying the firewood. He threw the firewood on the ground. ``Whew, where is some water? They said they were going to bathe, are they bathing? They aren't here. They went away.''
 
\noindent They had gone, and he called after them. He called them. ``Yoohoo, are you bathing?''
 
\noindent They had disappeared. They didn't call. He came back. He looked around. ``What, their things aren't here. Where did they take the things?''

\noindent The \textit{toto} spirit decided to leave. He went running after them. Darkness overtook him.
 
\noindent He came back. He arrived back. ``Oh boy, because I wasn't hungry they disappeared. Now I'm hungry, and they aren't here. I'm hungry now.''
 
\noindent He lit a fire, and later did something bad.
 
\noindent He went to sleep hungry. He could be heard in the night. ``Now I'm going to be hungry. When I was going to eat my meat, they went away. I was going to eat them, and they went away.''
 
\noindent Morning came. ``I'll eat my belly. Look, it's thick. I'm going to eat it. I'm hungry.''
 
\noindent It was a circular cut. He cut the belly out. Then he roasted the belly. It was ready. He licked his fingers. He toasted manioc meal. He ate some manioc meal. He ate his belly.
 
\noindent After he was done eating his belly, he covered the middle of his body with a wild banana leaf. He got water ready. His water was in the vessel. He drank water. He drank all the water. His water came out, \textit{Ssssss}.
 
\noindent ``Oh no, my water came out. Look, my water came out.''
 
\noindent So he tied inner bark around the middle of his body. He placed wild banana leaves in. He tied the middle of his body. Then he lay in his hammock, on his back.
 
\noindent ``Hoo, I'm thirsty, because I couldn't drink water.'' He drank some more water.
 
\noindent His water came pouring out. ``Oh no, it doesn't stop.''
 
\noindent So he went back and lay in his hammock again. ``Whew!''
 
\noindent His gut started to hurt. He lay sick in the hammock. He rotted right where he lay.
 
\noindent His brother-in-law came. ``Toto Abono, the people eater, lives here.''
 
\noindent He smelled him from far out. ``Peeoo, is that him? He has started to rot.'' He was rotting because of his guts. He was dead, lying in the hammock.

\noindent He yelled at his brother-in-law, who he had found lying dead in his hammock. ``Why did Toto Abono cut himself open? He didn't hunt. He was always hungry. Now he has cut himself open. He was eating my sisters. He didn't want to have children. He was strangling my sisters. Let him lie there dead in his hammock.''
 
\noindent He left him there. He went home.
 
\noindent So the vultures ate him. So the \textit{toto} spirit died. He lay dead in the hammock. He left him there.
 
\noindent He told about him back home. ``Toto Abono is lying there in the hammock. He had cut himself up. Toto Abono had died. My two sisters didn't wait, they came home. He would have eaten them.''
 
\noindent ``Toto Abono had eaten our older sisters, and we found their skulls. We didn't like him. We left him behind, looking for us.''
 
\noindent They left him behind. He ate himself. Then he died. The vultures ate him, the king vultures. But his manioc was still there, with no one to grate it.
 
\noindent They didn't see him anymore. ``Don't go after Toto Abono anymore. Toto Abono is lying dead in a hammock. Let him be dead. He cut up his belly. He ate his belly, it tasted really good. The liquid from inside him spilled out, the water which he had drunk.''
 
\noindent So he came home. He arrived home. ``Mother, your son-in-law ate himself and he died and is lying there in the hammock.''
 
\noindent ``He was my son-in-law, but I didn't eat his game; he ate my daughters. This is what he asked for. Let him be dead. He is dead. He is no more. He has rotted. Why did he hurt himself? He has rotted. He can't be touched. He is lying rotten in his hammock.''
 
\noindent ``We will go back there and see his bones.''
 
\noindent After three days they went after their brother-in-law. A king vulture had cut off his head and had taken his head far away from the body, and it was on the ground. ``There is the head on the ground.''
 
\noindent The vultures ate him. They came upon a vulture on the ground eating him during the day at the place where he died. It ate a lot as it ate the \textit{hato} spirit.
 
\noindent ``There is a vulture sitting on a branch. His rotted hammock is hanging there. His skin is in the hammock.''
 
\noindent They came home. They arrived home.
 
\noindent ``Well?''
 
\noindent ``Well, he isn't living there anymore. He isn't there. His bones are in a pile. Why did he cut into himself and eat himself? Now he is dead. There is game in the forest. Toto Abono didn't want to make my sisters pregnant, but he married them. In the end he ate himself. Now he is dead.''
