\noindent It was a different woman [from the woman of the previous story], she was pregnant. She called her husband to go with her.

\noindent ``Wait a little while, I'm going to pulverize the \textit{iha} poison. I'm going to pulverize the \textit{iha} poison now. When I have spread the poison on the arrow points, we will go out. It's early in the day.''

\noindent He pulverized the poison, and cooked it. The poison boiled. He took the poison off the fire. He also cooked another small pot using the same powder, so he could spread it on the arrows a second time. He stirred the poison that was to be spread the second time.

\noindent ``It's thick. Ok, that's good,'' he said.

\noindent He tied the blowgun darts in a bundle, and tied the arrow points in another bundle. He didn't take long, but she was in a hurry, so she went out into the forest.

\noindent ``I'm hungry and he isn't leaving.''

\noindent Her husband was hungry. They didn't have anything to eat, and they were hungry. He pulverized the poison, hungry. He spread the poison on the arrow points. He dried the arrow points by the fire. He set the arrow points next to the fire, and he set the dart points next to the fire, too. He came back.

\noindent ``Where is she, I told her to wait for me? She went off. I wanted her to wait for me, but she left me behind. Whew, I'm hungry.''

\noindent She was upset. She was going upset. She was pregnant. She went out and beat \textit{kona} roots. She put the \textit{kona} poison in the stream. She picked up the fish.

\noindent He came.

\noindent ``Hoo, I'm really hungry. What should I eat? Wait, there is some tapioca in the pot there. I'm going to eat a little of the tapioca.''

\noindent His wife was angry with him later. His wife would be angry with him. He took half of the tapioca. He rubbed the tapioca between his hands. He toasted the tapioca. He ate the tapioca. He finished eating the tapioca.

\noindent ``I'm going after her.''

\noindent Then she came back. She had fish in her hands, also leaves and \textit{hamise} aerial roots, for wrapping the fish. She came, and wrapped the fish, and roasted the fish. She took a look at the tapioca.

\noindent ``My husband has eaten half of the tapioca,'' she said, unhappy.

\noindent ``Did you eat half of my tapioca? You didn't wait for me. You ate half of my tapioca,'' she said. She was speaking angrily. ``Why don't you find other wives to give you food?'' She was upset because of the tapioca.

\noindent He was going to be upset. ``I ate a little of the tapioca. You can still eat tapioca.''

\noindent She roasted the fish. She took the fish off the fire. She put the fish on the ground. She rubbed the piece of tapioca between her hands. She toasted the tapioca. She didn't say, ``My husband is hungry. Let him eat a little of the tapioca.'' Because she didn't say that, he became upset.

\noindent She said, ``Did you do that?''

\noindent He said, ``I did that. I took a little piece of the tapioca and ate it.''

\noindent He lay in his hammock, upset. It's wrong to say, ``You should find other wives to give you food.'' Why did she say that? He lay in his hammock, upset.

\noindent She finished toasting the tapioca.

\noindent ``Come here. Let's eat. Come here.''

\noindent He was upset. He lay in his hammock, upset. The sun went down. He lay in his hammock, upset. She ate. She wanted to eat with him, but he didn't come. She saved some of the fish. She saved a little tapioca for him, too. He was upset. He lay in his hammock, upset.

\noindent His wife called him. ``You didn't come to eat fish.''

\noindent ``I already ate. I ate my wives' food. You go ahead and eat,'' he said. ``I ate my wives' food. You eat.''

\noindent He was upset. He lay in his hammock again, upset.

\noindent He wanted to take snuff and he called his father. ``Father, I want snuff. I want to take snuff.''

\noindent ``He hasn't eaten, and he is asking for snuff,'' his wife said.

\noindent So he took snuff. He came back and drank water. He drank water so he could go to sleep, upset. His wife called him many times to eat, but it had no effect. He was upset, and they hung up some fish for him. There was also toasted manioc mash for him in the pot. He was upset.

\noindent Morning came. He got going.

\noindent ``I'm going out into the forest. I'm going to catch a river turtle. Keep some food for me. You (pl) don't come after me.''

\noindent ``Sister.''

\noindent ``Huh?''

\noindent ``Sister, put some manioc mash in a container for me.''

\noindent So he left. He went out. He disappeared into the forest. The others came upon his brother-in-law [in the garden], who had taken some ripe bananas off the stalk, and had put them in a basket. They were taking roasted fish for the woman's husband.

\noindent ``You (pl) take along roasted fish for that man,'' his wife said.

\noindent ``If I take the roasted fish, is he going to want my food? Didn't you see him? He isn't going to want my food. I shouldn't take the roasted fish.''

\noindent ``Take a little. Here is manioc mash for him.''

\noindent They went. As they went, they came upon the one who had put bananas in a basket, standing there.

\noindent ``Whew, put the bananas in, to eat with the fish.''

\noindent He started out. They came upon him as they were walking. They walked. He shot animals with his blowgun. They shot animals with their blowguns. They went. They arrived.

\noindent ``Shall we go hunting?''

\noindent ``Let's go hunting. We will sleep and eat meat.''

\noindent They went. They found animals. They shot the animals with their blowguns. They brought the animals back. They burned the hair off the animals. They ate the animals. They roasted the animals on a rack. They ate the animals. Then they started out. They were going to sleep, and then start out.

\noindent He didn't want the little fish his brothers-in-law called him to eat, so they ate the fish.

\noindent ``Brother-in-law, these fish are for you.''

\noindent ``I'm not going to eat the fish. I don't want to eat the fish. I already ate.''

\noindent He didn't want to eat the fish, so they ate the fish. They ate. The moon was bright. They ate. They were going to catch river turtles.

\noindent ``Let's go hunting first. When we have hunted, and when we have roasted the animals, we will catch river turtles [on another trip].''

\noindent They were going to catch river turtles. First they went hunting the next day. They shot animals with their blowguns. Woolly monkeys, brown capuchins. They shot the animals, and brought the animals back, and burned the hair off the animals. They burned the hair off the animals. When they were done burning the hair off the animals, they cut the animals up.

\noindent ``You (pl) make a rack.''

\noindent They made a rack. They finished making the rack. They lay the animals on top. They cut firewood. They broke the branches of fallen trees. They carried off the branches. They lit the firewood. They roasted the animals.

\noindent ``Let's go home tomorrow.''

\noindent ``I don't know, wait. First let's look at the river turtles.''

\noindent They got up and went. The turtle was burying its eggs. Because it was really big, it carried him [when he tried to catch it]. It didn't stay there.

\noindent ``You two go that way. The two of us will go this way,'' he said.

\noindent They had just gone. The river turtles were on the beach. He wanted to get a river turtle. He ran to catch a turtle, and the turtle carried him. It was a big turtle. He wanted to catch the turtle but he couldn't. It carried him away. He kept holding onto the turtle. His younger brother also grabbed one. The two of them went and grabbed them.

\noindent It was taking him. There were caimans there. They were calling, and they were going to kill him. He was struggling with the turtle. It carried him off. He was holding onto it, making noise in the water. A caiman attacked and bit him. They ate him alive.

\noindent His younger brother came.

\noindent ``They killed my older brother, look. He didn't let go of the turtle,'' he said.

\noindent The caimans ate him. They could be heard, ``\textit{Obe}, \textit{obe},'' as they ate him.

\noindent He was upset. He went to his two brothers-in-law, who had gone off.

\noindent ``Let's go back. The caimans ate my brother, because of the turtle. He didn't let go of the turtle, and the turtle went off carrying him. He was holding onto the turtle in the water, and the caimans killed him.''

\noindent So they came back [to the place where the man had been killed].

\noindent ``Where?''

\noindent ``The caimans can be heard as they eat my brother.''

\noindent They were making a lot of noise, the many caimans.

\noindent ``Let's go. They are eating our brother-in-law.''

\noindent They came back [to their camp]. They came back, and they arrived. They slept a little. They were going to get started.

\noindent ``We will go home tomorrow.''

\noindent They roasted his animals again. They roasted the animals.

\noindent ``Animals will not be eaten anymore [because the man who died knew how to hunt better than the others]. Let's carry the animals so we can eat the animals. We won't eat what he kills anymore. The animals are eating him.''

\noindent They put the animals in a big basket. He put the animals in the basket. He carried the animals. He was going to eat all the animals his brother-in-law killed.

\noindent He got up. They left. ``Come on, let's go.''

\noindent They came back. They came back, tired. They carried the animals. His brothers-in-law carried what he had killed, which was roasted.

\noindent His younger sister was pregnant. They came back. He remembered his brother-in-law and cried. He came back crying. They came back. He came back crying, and they ran to him.

\noindent He went. He wanted to pierce his sister with his blowgun. She was pregnant. He wanted to kill his sister.

\noindent They saw him and went running. They went running.

\noindent They arrived. He was carrying the basket and crying because of his brother-in-law. He came and arrived. He wanted to hit them. His other younger brothers were there in the plaza, and they restrained him, because he wanted to hit them. His younger brothers restrained him. They calmed him down. His mother and the others calmed him down. He stopped crying.

\noindent ``You didn't eat quietly with my brother-in-law,'' he said, crying. He wanted to kill his sister. His younger brothers restrained him, and she escaped.

\noindent They made a rack to roast the animals on, and they put the animals on top. They roasted the animals.

\noindent ``You roast mine.''

\noindent They roasted the animals. They ate the animals. The animals were all gone.
