The story \textit{Bahi} was told by Siko in 1991. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-bahi2.mp3}.

This text is a self-contained series of episodes from a longer story about Bahi.\footnote{The present section begins at the 13 minute 31 second point in the recording.} In the beginning and ending sections of the text, which I have not included here, Bahi shows his extraordinary powers, turning people into various kinds of animals, and arriving at a place with a flash of light. In the present episodes, however, Bahi seems like a pretty normal person: he hunts woolly monkeys and tapirs, and gets married.
