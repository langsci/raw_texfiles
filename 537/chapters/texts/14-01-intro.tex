The story \textit{Mayawari} was told by Siko in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-mayawari2.mp3}.

A Jarawara man named Mayawari set out with his young son to spend the night waiting for monkeys to come to eat fruits of a \textit{ko} tree. A group of enemy Yimas ambushed them on the way, and killed them with spears. They draped the boy's intestines on sticks stuck in the ground, so the other Jarawaras would see them.

When Mayawari and his son didn't come back, his son-in-law went out after him. When he cried out in the forest and a Yima answered him, he came running home. After that, two men went out after the Yimas, but they were gone.
