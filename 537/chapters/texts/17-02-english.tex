\noindent My father went out into the forest. He didn't see any game. He came back a ways. His rifle was setting against a tree. There was a miriti palm in the swamp. My father felt with his feet in the mud for miriti fruits, making them come to the surface. He picked the miriti fruits up and set them on dry ground. He picked the fruits up one at a time. The fruits were in a pile. He was waving his leg back and forth, then picking up the fruits and throwing them. ``I don't have a basket for the miriti fruits, there are some \textit{hawa} palm leaves for making a makeshift basket.''

\noindent As he was looking at the leaves and thinking about making the basket, a cougar came at him. It came and attacked him. It wanted to knock my father over. He grabbed its front paws. ``Oh,'' my father said, struggling to stay up. My father was kneeling in the mud. The cougar was trying to bite him in the face. He was holding it as far away as he could. He stood up. ``You are messing with me.'' He got up with it, and turned toward the miriti palm. He moved it over, and pushed it against the miriti palm. \textit{Teee}, went its head.
	

\noindent He ran off and got his rifle, and came right back. He put a bullet in the rifle, and looked around for the cougar. It was gone. After having its head hit on the miriti palm, it went away. It didn't come back. It went away, hurt. ``Why did you run away? Come back, you fierce animal,'' my father said.
	

\noindent He weaved a makeshift basket, and put the miriti fruits in it. He lifted the basket on his back. ``That fierce animal who fought with me has disappeared. I didn't have my weapon, and I would have shot it, but it disappeared.''
	

\noindent My father left and came back. He arrived. ``Whew! You almost didn't have a father. The miriti fruits I'm bringing almost brought disaster on me. As I was getting the fruits, an animal attacked me. A cougar attacked me. I grabbed it, and it made me go down in the mud. I stood up with the cougar and pushed it, and it hit the back of its head. I went running and quickly got the rifle and came right back. I thought it was still around, but it was gone. I looked for it, and finally came on home.''
	

\noindent The others laughed at him as he spoke back home. ``Did it attack you?''
	

\noindent ``Yes, it attacked me. The women go there all the time [to get miriti fruits. It would have killed them if it had been them.] It came at me lifting up its paws, and wanted to knock me down. I lifted up its paws, holding on. I was going to shoot it, but it disappeared. It went away. It wanted to mess me up, but I held onto its paws. I was kneeling in the mud. I almost couldn't get back up with it. I stood back up with it. I was going to shoot it, but it disappeared.''
