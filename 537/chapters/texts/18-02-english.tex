\noindent I am telling another story, about when my father fought along with a spirit.
 
\noindent {``}`Why are you standing there?' my familiar spirit said,'' my father said.
 
\noindent ``I have come to see them fighting.''
 
\noindent ``You will see them. Let's go see them.''
 
\noindent The Yima Wa house, which the spirits fought against, is still there today. He said that a spirit came out of the house, and other spirits chased him.
 
\noindent ``Don't let him get away,'' they said.
 
\noindent They went running after him, but he killed them. They chased him. They complained because he killed one of them. He went running away after killing someone.
 
\noindent The two of them were standing there watching them, he used to say.

\noindent ``The spirit that killed someone is coming,'' he said.
 
\noindent My father got up quickly.
 
\noindent One spirit had taken the other into the forest. The two of them went running away. One killed the other. He killed the other one, and went away. They watched him. The spirit came back after taking the other spirit away. They didn't see him killing the other one.
 
\noindent My father said that he looked back at the spirit. ``The spirit is coming,'' my father said.
 
\noindent His familiar spirit looked, too. ``The spirit is coming. Go on ahead.''
 
\noindent The two of them went running away.
 
\noindent ``\textit{Haahaa},'' the spirit said [coming after them].
 
\noindent ``Hold on my back. The spirit is going to kill us.''
 
\noindent My father used to say that the spirit's arms were together. His arms were together, he said. He came holding a club high.
 
\noindent My father's familiar spirit turned around [to face the other spirit, who was coming toward them], my father used to say.
 
\noindent The spirit yelled [as he attacked them].
 
\noindent My father held on. ``The spirit is going to kill me along with my familiar spirit.''
 
\noindent My father's familiar spirit grabbed the spirit's arms, my father used to say.
 
\noindent ``\textit{Fofo} \textit{fofo} \textit{fofoo},'' the spirit said [as he tried to free his arms].
 
\noindent The spirit threw my father down along with his familiar spirit, my father used to say. The spirit fell on his knees because of him. He got back up, and yelled. He grabbed his arm.
 
\noindent The spirit struggled with my father's familiar spirit, and pushed him, so he would fall down.

\noindent ``Don't let go of my back. I will take care of us.''
 
\noindent The spirit made him feel sad, my father said. I am remembering him.
 
\noindent My father's familiar spirit closed his eyes, he used to say. He yelled. He hit the spirit. He protected them, my father said. He was Moni Nai. He took away the spirit's weapon.
 
\noindent The spirit came at them. He attacked them, in order to take back the weapon. But my father's familiar spirit got him back.
 
\noindent ``Hold on.''
 
\noindent My father's familiar spirit went after the spirit. He pushed him.
 
\noindent ``It's my turn,'' he said.
 
\noindent My father was holding on, he used to say. They were hitting each other. My father's familiar spirit pushed the spirit hard. He slashed him on the back of the neck. He yelled [in victory].
 
\noindent The spirit made my father cry. My father's familiar spirit slashed him, and he struggled with them, my father said. My father took quick looks at him, he said.
 
\noindent ``Let him lie there.''
 
\noindent The spirit made my father feel sad [because he died], he used to say. He had difficulty breathing, he said. Moni Nai slashed him on the back of his shoulder.
 
\noindent As they were coming back, another spirit came upon them. A spirit was chasing the spirit.
