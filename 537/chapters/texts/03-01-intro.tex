The story \textit{The first corn} was told by Siko in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-firstcorn.mp3}.

According to this story, the man who first introduced the various crops that the Jarawaras grow in their gardens, especially corn, became the first Paumari when he subsequently went away. The Paumaris are close neighbors of the Jarawaras on the Purus River, and they speak a somewhat distantly related Arawan language. One of the characters in the story is a grandmother who became the first snake. The origin of body piercing and beating with a switch is connected with the origin of gardening in the story.
