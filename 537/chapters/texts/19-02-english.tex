\noindent Its voice started up. ``\textit{Hao}, \textit{hao}, \textit{hao},'' it went. My father heard its voice. It was coming, and its voice was starting up. ``\textit{Heeee},'' it said.
 
\noindent ``It's the sound of a monster. I want to go hunting, but something is chasing me. It's the sound of a monster. I heard its voice.''
 
\noindent It was running. It was coming toward him running. There were ten bullets for the rifle.
 
\noindent ``\textit{Aaya}, \textit{aaya}, \textit{hahohohoo}, \textit{hoooo}.''
 
\noindent The monster was coming, my father used to say. It was coming to catch my father. It was going to catch my father, but he shot it with the rifle, \textit{baaaa}. He shot it again. When he shot it again, it fell.
 
\noindent Another one came running. My father went running. He went running away, and it came after him, the male. It was a male. It was a male that ran after my father. My father shot the male, too, in the chest. He shot it in the chest. As it ran after him, he shot it in the side. He shot it, and it was lying on the ground.
 
\noindent He came back running. His younger brother went running there.
 
\noindent ``Older brother, what did you shoot?''
 
\noindent ``Botehefo, a monster came here. I came here because the monster was chasing me.''
 
\noindent My uncle came running back. They came running back. It was noon. They appeared at the village. My father was sweaty.
 
\noindent My uncle was in his hammock talking. ``I thought my brother had shot a tapir. My brother had shot a monster, a creature. It is lying out there on the ground. Should we eat it?''
 
\noindent ``I don't know, I guess we shouldn't eat it.''
 
\noindent ``It is not a tapir. The monsters had a strong odor. They had long tails. The monster that my brother shot was skinny. My brother shot it and it is lying there on the ground. You have never seen it. If we go into the forest, the creature will eat us.''
 
\noindent The jaguar was like that long ago. It carried off people during the night.
 
\noindent ``My brother had a hard time. The two of them are lying on the ground, my brother killed them,'' my uncle said, speaking. ``The male was not fat. But the female was fat,'' my uncle said, speaking.
 
\noindent ``We shouldn't go after them. They aren't good for eating. Let them just die.''
 
\noindent ``Yes, let them just lie there. The spirits will eat them.''
 
\noindent They didn't want them, because they weren't tapirs. We wanted to go and see them, but they didn't let us. They said they had a strong odor. Five bullets were spent on the male. He came upon one, and then came upon another. He shot that one, too. He shot the two of them with bullets. Now it is shotguns, not rifles.
 
\noindent He said he dreamed about them. He met up with them, and shot them. They died. The spirits took them away after my father shot them. The spirit carried the creature on its back, my father said.
 
\noindent ``Can I eat the creature you killed? I will eat the creature that you killed,'' the spirit said.
 
\noindent ``All right, go ahead and take it. I shot it because it was going to eat me.''
 
\noindent ``I will eat it. I don't want it to go to waste.''
 
\noindent He waited for it while it tied up the creature. It pulled down some vines and tied up the creature. It tied it up. It put it on its back, he said. It took it away. It ate it over there. Then they came back for the other one. They took them away.
 
\noindent ``I wanted to pick up crabwood fruits, but some creatures chased me, and I have come back. I was going to fish, but I didn't fish, because the creatures chased me. I shot them. They are lying there on the ground. Their faces are not fat. Their feet are like people's feet. Their hands are paws of jaguars.''
 
\noindent He said they were not fat. He said they were skinny. Only the female was somewhat fat. 	The spirits took them away. A spirit took them away, my father said.
 
\noindent Then my father went into the forest again, and he heard a spirit crying, he said. There was a spirit standing inside the buttress roots of a big tree, and the spirit was crying, my father said. ``\textit{Oooo}, \textit{oooo},'' it said, my father said.
 
\noindent ``The spirit is crying.''
 
\noindent The spirit was sitting on the ground, my father said. It was crying all over. The spirit was sitting. The spirit was cold.
 
\noindent ``Leave me alone. I see you. Leave me alone. I didn't hurt you,'' my father said. ``Go away. I am going, too.''
 
\noindent Then my father went away and told about it. The spirits came after it, and one of them killed the spirit, my father said. It took it away. It carried it over his shoulder. Its hair hung down, he said.
 
\noindent It cried all over the forest. He wouldn't have seen it otherwise, he said. He went by it, and it started crying, he said, after he had passed. ``It won't make me afraid,'' he said. He came back after it, and came upon it, he said. Then he went on. A spirit took it away, he said.
 
\noindent ``It scared you, but it won't scare you anymore. I am going to take it away. I will eat it.''
 
\noindent ``Go ahead and take it away. I don't want it to chase me.''
 
\noindent It took it away. It carried it on its shoulder. It had a weapon to kill it with, a spear. It was a spear.
