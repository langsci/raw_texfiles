The story \textit{The hungry old man} was told by Siko in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-hungryman.mp3}.

An old man was left alone to take care of his three grandsons, and he was so hungry that he killed the two smaller grandsons and roasted them and ate them. The older grandson ran away to his parents and told them what happened. When they got back, the man's daughter complained, but her husband didn't say anything. The man's son, who had been out hunting, also returned. When he also complained, the man went for his spear, but his son broke it in pieces. Finally the man's son-in-law offered the man a piece of meat on which he had put a spell, and the old man died after eating it.
