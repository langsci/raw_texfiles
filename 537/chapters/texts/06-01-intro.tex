The story \textit{The man who got away from the Kose Mati} was told by Siko in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-mankose.mp3}.

Siko told a number of very funny stories, and this is one of them. The Jarawaras are afraid of monsters that live in the forest, but in Siko's stories, the monsters, who are generally not very bright, just about always lose. The story also gives some insight into shamanism among the Jarawaras. The man who is the main character of the story is a shaman, and with his shamanic powers he manages to foil the attempts of the \textit{kose mati} monster to drown him. And when he calls out for help, two of his familiar spirits come and rescue him from the monster. They kill the monster, and carry it away and eat it.
