\noindent The people from Awita Fa put spells on each other.
 
\noindent ``I'm going after \textit{hawa} fruits. Boil some manioc juice.''\footnote{The Jarawaras don't boil manioc juice to mix with \emph{\textit{hawa}} fruits anymore, today they use water, but Yowao's wife Aobina used to make it when they were younger.}
 
\noindent He went. He got palm leaves for a basket. He wove the basket. He put down leaves inside the basket. Then he cut down the \textit{hawa} palm. He chopped at the \textit{hawa} palm.
 
\noindent His brother-in-law came, and heard the sound of him. \textit{Toko}, \textit{toko}, \textit{toko}, went the sound of the ax.
 
\noindent ``Oh no, that's my \textit{hawa} palm where I kill birds that eat its fruits. He is cutting down the \textit{hawa} palm where I kill birds that eat its fruits. I will get revenge. I will put a spell on him.''
 
\noindent He went away. He prepared a shaman's stone. He put a spell on some cotton string. He extended the string across the path of his brother-in-law. He waited for him.
 
\noindent The first man put the \textit{hawa} fruits that had fallen with the palm into the basket. He was ready. He thought there wasn't anyone there. His brother-in-law was hiding.
 
\noindent He came back carrying the \textit{hawa} fruits on his back. He hit against the line that was extended. \textit{Yebe} [shocking], went the thing. He fell down. He passed out.
 
\noindent His brother-in-law pretended to come. He came upon him as he was lying there.
 
\noindent ``Ah, I guess someone cast a spell on my brother-in-law. They have messed with my brother-in-law.''
 
\noindent He took snuff. He sucked on his brother-in-law to cure him. He took the shaman's stone out of him. His brother-in-law sat up.
 
\noindent ``Whew, someone put a spell on me.''
 
\noindent ``Someone messed with you. I wonder who it was. I was coming and came upon you. Stand up.''
 
\noindent He helped him to his feet. He grabbed his arm, and helped him to his feet.
 
\noindent ``Whew, what were you doing?''
 
\noindent ``I am going hunting.''
 
\noindent ``Right, go ahead. Go ahead.''
 
\noindent ``You go home. Go home sick. I guess someone cast a spell on you. Someone put a spell on you, and I am sucking on you to cure you.''
 
\noindent So he went home.
 
\noindent The hunter picked up his blowgun, and went into the forest.
 
\noindent The first man lifted the \textit{hawa} fruits onto his back, and went home. He was unsteady as he went sick. He stopped, and looked back.
 
\noindent ``He is the one that messed with me. It is his sickness that I have. I will get revenge.''
 
\noindent The other man went into the forest. He disappeared.
 
\noindent ``Something touched me.''
 
\noindent He untied the string that had been tied. He tied the string back together. He took it and tied it somewhere else.
 
\noindent ``He messed with me. I saw him.''
 
\noindent Then he got revenge on him. He tied the string, and left the hunter behind. He came back.
 
\noindent ``I will go back sick. The sickness is intense.''
 
\noindent He came back sick.
 
\noindent ``Look my father is coming back there,'' his daughter said. ``My father fell down. My father is not walking good,'' she said.
 
\noindent His younger brother looked quickly. ``My older brother is hurt. Someone hurt my brother.''

\noindent ``Whew, lower my hammock. I am hurt. I am coming back sick.''
 
\noindent ``Brother, what happened to you?''
 
\noindent ``I think someone cast a spell on me, and I have come back,'' he said.
 
\noindent ``Someone cast a spell on you.''
 
\noindent So he sucked on him to cure him. He left off sucking on him. The sun went down.
 
\noindent Late in the day the hunter came back, carrying toucans, carrying birds. The other man's shaman's stone was tied up. Because it was late in the day, he ran, and he hit against the string. There was the sound of him hitting, \textit{kiha}. He felt a shock in his head. \textit{Iii}, he fell down.
 
\noindent The ants cut off the feathers of his toucans during the night. The birds were without any feathers. The ants were spraying the eyes of the owner of the birds during the night.
 
\noindent The younger brother was sucking on his older brother to cure him, and then he stopped sucking on him.
 
\noindent ``Oh no, my older brother went into the forest, and he has not come back. I will go look at my brother,'' said the brother of the hunter.
 
\noindent He lit a resin torch. The two of them went. They called. They went some more, and they called.
 
\noindent ``Did he die? We would have found him if he were alive.''
 
\noindent ``He will sleep in the forest for the time being. We will get up early because of him.''
 
\noindent ``Right, we will go home for now.''
 
\noindent They turned back near where he was lying on the ground. They came back.

\noindent ``Well, did you meet up with him?''
 
\noindent ``We didn't meet up with him. `Where is he?' we said. We came back.''
 
\noindent ``He disappeared. He will come back after he sleeps,'' [said someone else].

\noindent ``We will get up early. I will get up early because of my older brother.''
 
\noindent They slept. They got up early. He carried food for his brother. The two of them went to where their older brother was lying on the ground.
 
\noindent Their brother was lying there on the ground. His eyes were full of holes. His birds were there.
 
\noindent ``This is what happens when people hate each other. He died because someone cast a spell on him.''
 
\noindent ``Someone put a spell on him. Those people did it, older brother. The younger brother has been sucking on his older brother to cure him.''
 
\noindent ``Yes, those people did it. The younger brother has been sucking on his older brother to cure him. Let's take him back.''
 
\noindent They cut a pole. They put the pole against their brother's chest, and they tied up their brother. They carried him. They brought him back. They started crying. The two of them came back crying.
 
\noindent ``That's their voices as they are coming back. Take care of us, younger brother. I can't stand well. They are coming to me crying. I got revenge on the one who messed with me. Now they are coming crying because of him.''
 
\noindent Then they appeared. He was attached to a pole. They had lashed him.
 
\noindent ``Haania, brother-in-law, let's cry because of what you did.''
 
\noindent They all cried because they missed the man from Awita Fa. They cried, and then they stopped crying because of him.
 
\noindent ``Let's cry because of what you did.''
 
\noindent ``I can't stand well. They are coming to me crying. You go there [i.e. I can't go because I'm sick].''
 
\noindent They cried. He lay on the ground. They carried him. They cried. Then they changed.
 
\noindent They were squatting as they were crying. One of them got a stomach ache. They started to cry again, and they were squatting. \textit{Booo}, went the sound of the fart. As they were crying, the sound of the fart went, \textit{booo}. It made them laugh.
