Bahi had his first menstruation. He lay on the ground, on his belly, holding his face with his hands. He didn't look at the others. He was always turned the other way, so he wouldn't look at them. He was teaching the girls [what to do at their first menstruation]. They called him, but he didn't accept any food. ``Leave my food on the ground. I will pick it up later,'' Bahi said. ``I will eat it. I don't want a torch light. I will eat in the dark.'' [If he sees his food, he will get sick.]

 ``Here is your food on the ground. You get it in the dark and eat,'' his grandmother said. His grandmother spoke to him.

 He didn't eat in the light of a torch, he ate in the dark. When he was done eating, he called for water to drink, and his grandmother brought some water and set it at the door. He picked it up behind him, to drink it. Then he washed his hands. Bahi was afraid to look at anyone. He was teaching the girls. ``Don't look at them. You should do what I am doing in the future,'' he said. ``You shouldn't look at your father, your mother, your older brothers. Don't let your older brothers get sick because of the blood in your eyes,'' he said. ``We also should not look at our food when we eat. We also should not take snuff.''

 He lay there in the same place, not leaving. He just lay there in the same place. He didn't take a bath while he was in seclusion. Finally he took a bath [when his menstruation was over, and he came out of seclusion]. When his menstruation was over, he got up. He put on decorations, teaching the others.

 ``Let's whip Bahi with switches. Let's whip Bahi.''

 ``Whip me. I was looking at you all the time,'' he said [lying]. They wanted to whip him, and they whipped him. They had Bahi's coming out, he was teaching the girls. They whipped him, and he lay there on the logs for a long time, not getting food, not eating food, because he had been whipped. He was really skinny. Then he ate.

 ``You eat meat, you eat \textit{aba} fish.''

 ``I'm going to eat \textit{aba} fish. Wait, I'm going to eat.''

 There were lots of people at the feast for Bahi, all gathered together. Where did they live? There were a lot of people. They whipped Bahi. They live downstream nowadays.

 He got better from the whipping. He made war. He wasn't a woman, and he hid himself. He lay on the ground. They put decorations on him. He had annatto on his arms, and he had armbands and his woman's breach cloth, but he wasn't a woman.

 He didn't look at his father, his mother, his younger sisters, his older brothers. He lay next to his mother, and he didn't look at her. [The custom of the seclusion hut had not yet come into existence.] He ate by the light of a torch. Nowadays the girls eat with a light. He couldn't eat anything that had fat. He was hungry a lot. He couldn't eat any bad meat [like peccary, and some kinds of fish]. He ate brown capuchin monkey, and woolly monkey. He stopped eating woolly monkey and then ate white-fronted capuchin, and giant anteater. That was his only food, so he wouldn't get sick. He was teaching the others.

 He put some snuff in each of his nostrils. Then his grandfather blew snuff into his nose. His grandfather blew a shaman's stone into his nose.

 ``I'm suffering from thirst. I'm standing in the plaza [stoned],'' he said, after his grandfather blew into his nose.

 After his grandfather blew snuff into him, he ate good food, and got healthy again. His mother restricted him [she restricted his activities and his diet, so he wouldn't get sick]. His grandfather had blown snuff into him. He knew a lot now [i.e. he had spiritual power], because they whipped him. Bahi inhaled snuff really hard. He inhaled strong snuff.

 The women went and burned the men, starting today's custom. They were paying them back for whipping Bahi. He lay on the \textit{awa siyo} logs. They were \textit{awa siyo} logs.
