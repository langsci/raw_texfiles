\noindent They went downstream. They built a house, and then went hunting. As they were hunting, they saw some woolly monkeys, and shot at them with blowguns. No monkeys died. He only took home one little monkey. He burned the hair off the monkey back in the village, in the fire his mother lit. After he burned the hair off the monkey, he cut up the monkey, and roasted the monkey on the fire. He toasted some manioc mash, and took the monkey off the fire. Then he ate the monkey, not noticing it still had blood in it.
 
\noindent ``Are you eating bloody meat?'' his mother said.
 
\noindent ``The meat doesn't have blood in it. The meat isn't bloody. I'm really hungry,'' he said. ``I'm really hungry, that's why I'm eating the monkey.''
 
\noindent He got up. He drank some water. He took some snuff, and then went out to defecate. He went out, and then came back. The house was in the middle of a large clearing. The village plaza was very big. As they were living in the middle of a clearing, he got a fever.
 
\noindent ``My thighs are really hurting a lot,'' he said. ``My head is hurting a lot.'' He had been hurt by a monster, at Oto Wari village.
 
\noindent It was dark. They slept. As they slept, he woke up talking because of his fever. ``Yasi, yasi tebere,'' he was whistling, like a bird.
 
\noindent ``That's Kamabira whistling, he was hurt by a monster,'' his uncle said.
 
\noindent ``I wasn't hurt by a monster. I'm fine,'' he said.
 
\noindent They stayed with him. His fever got worse. They sucked on him to make him well. After several tried, they stopped trying.
 
\noindent Then they moved to another place [because they were afraid of the spirits]. ``You and the others go on ahead,'' Nami Abono [his mother] said.
 
\noindent I want to find out what hurt him,'' my grandfather said.\footnote{Yowao's grandfather, Bono Wiyo, was also Siko's grandfather.}
 
\noindent No, you go on ahead,'' said Nami Abono. ``Don't wait for me.''
 
\noindent ``All right,'' he said in anger. ``You come on later. I'm leaving.'' So my grandfather took down his hammock, and moved out. They left.
 
\noindent Ye Yome [another name of Kamabira] was sick, and Bato Wene and his companion went with him after the others. They were taking him on their backs, and halfway they put him on the ground.
 
\noindent ``Wait a little for us. We are going to defecate,'' the two of them said.
 
\noindent The two of them went off and defecated, and then came back. As they came back, they heard a bird.
 
\noindent ``Yasi, yasi tebere,'' he was whistling.
 
\noindent He was crawling on all fours all around in the forest. He was going in circles.
 
\noindent ``We are taking you and you are not behaving,'' they said.
 
\noindent ``I'm not sick, you are just making it up,'' he said.
 
\noindent ``Come on, let's go. I'm going to lift you onto my back again,'' he said.
 
\noindent He lifted him onto his back. They went on. They heard someone hitting on his back. The spirit was hitting on his back. He fell off his back to the ground.
 
\noindent ``Ye Yome has died. Ye Yome has died and his mother went on ahead. Where will his grave be? His grave will be right here beside the trail,'' they said.
 
\noindent The \textit{maka} monster took away his soul. The monster killed him. They got the others, and buried him. They dug the hole for him and buried him. Then they came back this way. They came and arrived at Siro Wari. Now it is Maka Wari.\footnote{Siro Wari and Maka Wari were in the area of the Faha Biri stream, where the Jarawaras live today, whereas Oto Wari was further downstream on the Cainã River.} My grandfather came before the others to Siro Wari. They came and lived over here. They came upstream in the dry season.
