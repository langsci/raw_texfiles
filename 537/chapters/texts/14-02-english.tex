\noindent Those were the ones I told you about, the ones who planned to attack again, who cut up Mayawari.
 
\noindent Mayawari was going to wait [for game] at a \textit{ko} tree.
 
\noindent ``Mayawari.''
 
\noindent ``Huh?''
 
\noindent ``Are you going to wait for game at the \textit{ko} tree?''
 
\noindent ``Yes, I am going to wait for game at the \textit{ko} tree.''
 
\noindent They went out to find them, and this is what the Yimas wanted. Mayawari set out to wait for game at the \textit{ko} tree. He came singing. He was with his son. His son sang with him.
 
\noindent ``Sing the song.''
 
\noindent Mayawari's son sang with him. He came singing. He was going to wait for game at the \textit{ko} tree, and he sang late in the afternoon. It's good to look at what is far ahead, but he was absorbed in the song.
 
\noindent The Yima was probably aiming [his spear] at him. ``If I wanted to, I could spear you,'' he probably said. He was on the one side. His spear point is in the \textit{wakaro} tree.\footnote{There used to be a \textit{wakaro} tree that had a knot in the trunk, that the Jarawaras said was the place where the Yima's spear hit the tree. The tree was still standing within the lifetime of currently living Jarawaras.} There was another Yima on the other side.
 
\noindent There was a Yima woman lying there. Her vagina was open.
 
\noindent ``\textit{Fiko}, \textit{fiko}, \textit{fiko}. [Mayawari imitated the call of alarm of a brown capuchin as he fled off the trail into the forest.] Boy, there is something lying there.''
 
\noindent The boy cried out. ``Father, father.''
 
\noindent He came back quickly. He came running back. He grabbed his son's arm. He ran with his son. He went running off into the forest with his son.
 
\noindent The point of the spear is stuck in the tree. \textit{Koro} it went as he threw it, but he missed him. It went \textit{karo} as it hit the \textit{wakaro} tree.
 
\noindent ``Oh no, I missed the game.''
 
\noindent He went running up the hill, but there was another one waiting with a spear. He was aiming at him. He hit him.
 
\noindent ``\textit{Aya}.''
 
\noindent He laughed at him. Mayawari cried out. He also killed Mayawari's son.
 
\noindent They left. They took him.
 
\noindent ``Shall we cut him up?''
 
\noindent ``Yes, you cut him up. We will carry him in pieces.''
 
\noindent ``You gut his son. Drape his son's intestines along a pole. Let them see his intestines.''
 
\noindent So they took out his intestines. His intestines were extended along some sticks. His son's intestines were stuffed in the openings of split sticks.
 
\noindent When he came, he had been carrying arrows, but wasn't thinking. I don't know.
 
\noindent ``Mayawari didn't come back. Go look for Mayawari. He said he was going to wait for game at the \textit{ko} tree. He said he was going to come back right away. He disappeared with his boy.''
 
\noindent He went. He apparently didn't take any arrows.
 
\noindent ``If he would have been alert, the enemy wouldn't have speared him,'' they always said.
 
\noindent He went. ``They ate my son-in-law.''
 
\noindent ``Yoohoo,'' he said.
 
\noindent ``Yoohoo,'' answered the Yima.
 
\noindent ``I'm here, Mayawari's son-in-law. I want to die now that my father-in-law Mayawari is dead.'' The Yima appeared right away.
 
\noindent Mayawari's son-in-law looked. He stood for a bit. After he stood for a bit, the Yima, who had come into the area, spoke.
 
\noindent ``He called out. Where is he?''
 
\noindent He ran really fast. He had arrows, he should have shot him. He came running back.
 
\noindent ``Where are you?'' The Yima called out, but no one was there.
 
\noindent He kept on running. He came on. When he got back, ``Mayawari ... Mayawari was speared by the Yimas. His son died with him.''
 
\noindent Mayawari's son's father-in-law got right up. He grabbed some arrows. He went out. The two of them went running. They didn't find them.
 
\noindent They came back during the night. They appeared.
 
\noindent ``He ate my nephew and left.''
 
\noindent The ones who killed disappeared.
