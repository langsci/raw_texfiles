 The white-lipped peccaries were fierce, and we killed them with rifles. The people were telling about them. Their voices were like a garden burning. I was with the men, and I shot some of them. There was a female peccary that I shot, and they ate it. I carried heavy animals all day long, by myself. I left the peccaries in the forest. I got up early because of them, and went after them the next morning. The peccaries came back, and I met up with them again. Then I shot two more peccaries.
 
 There was a jaguar that was after the peccaries. When the jaguar was after the peccaries, their sound was fearsome.
 
 ``Is that the sound of peccaries that have a jaguar after them?''
 
 ``It is the sound of peccaries that have a jaguar after them. You be careful when you are going after the peccaries, Noko Wene.''
 
 ``We are going after the peccaries.''
 
 They were making a lot of noise. The voices of the peccaries could be heard. Noko Wene and the others went after them, and we waited for them. The noise of him could be heard. \textit{Teei} went the sound of a rifle.
 
 ``\textit{Yee},'' Noko Wene said. Noko Wene yelled many times.
 
 The jaguar was running with the peccaries as they ran. It was with the peccaries. I could have shot the jaguar, but I went past it. Tatiwi was running behind me, and he shot it. I thought he had shot a peccary.
 
 I went running, and I shot a peccary. Maneo Rowi shot one, too. We were carrying the peccaries that we had killed to a gathering point, and he came back after shooting the jaguar.
 
 ``Efe, Efe.''
 
 ``Huh?''
 
 ``Did you kill a peccary?''
 
 ``I did kill a peccary, it is lying there.''
 
 ``I killed a peccary, too, it is lying over there,'' he said. But he had killed a jaguar. ``I will go look at it.'' He went.
 
 We carried the peccaries, and put them together. We gutted the peccaries. We tied the peccaries up. We heard him start calling.
 
 ``Hey, hey.''
 
 ``Tatiwi is calling, Tatiwi said he shot a peccary.''
 
 ``The peccary is lying there,'' he said.
 
 ``Bring the peccary here.''
 
 ``The peccary can't be carried.'' He left it there. He came. ``Whew,'' he said.
 
 ``What is it?''
 
 ``The peccary is lying there. I shot the jaguar that was causing the commotion of the peccaries, and it is lying there. The jaguar can't be carried. The jaguar is there on the ground. Come on, let's go get it.''
 
 He tried to pick up the jaguar, but the jaguar couldn't be picked up. Noko Mora carried the jaguar. We brought it, and they skinned it. I guess Tatiwi sold its skin.

 One time when a jaguar attacked my grandfather, he shot it in the face and the shot was embedded in its snout.
 
 We came back. We brought the peccaries home. Back in the village we worked on the peccaries. They cooked the meat.
 
 Then we had a feast. We sang songs about them. We feasted on the meat.
 
 We feasted on meat many times, when we killed animals, white-lipped peccaries. Animals, tapir, they ate a tapir, too. When we had feasts, they ate peach palm nuts, too. They drank Amane's peach palm porridge. There were two large pots of peach palm porridge. He feasted a lot, and now he is feasting somewhere else.
