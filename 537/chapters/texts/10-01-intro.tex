The story \textit{The toto spirit} was told by Siko in 1991. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-totoabono.mp3}.

The spirit of the \textit{toto} bamboo didn't know how to fish or hunt, so he married his aunt's daughter in order to kill her and eat her. When he got hungry again, he went to his aunt and asked for another daughter, and he did the same thing again with her. Finally he brought the other two sisters to his village, but they caught on when they found the skulls of their sisters, and they ran home. Then, since the \textit{toto} spirit didn't have any meat, he cut out his own belly and roasted it and ate it. This resulted in his death, of course. His brother-in-law lambasted him for marrying his sisters to eat them instead of having children with them.
