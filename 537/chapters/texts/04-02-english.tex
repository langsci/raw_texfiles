 He was the one who a king vulture brought.

 They ate fruits. They ate sweet fruits. They cut down a \textit{bowi} tree with fruits. He was eating the fruits of the \textit{bowi} tree that they had cut down.

 They yelled when they cut the \textit{bowi} tree down. They yelled.

 They said, ``\textit{Yee}.'' The \textit{bowi} tree fell.

 Along with the women, they ate the fruits.

 ``They are eating fruits that are really good to eat. You are eating fruits that are really good to eat. You go on ahead. I'm going to eat more fruits.'' He brought misfortune on himself.

 A spirit, who was not a king vulture, turned himself into a vulture, and came after him. He was a spirit.

 After everyone left, he was left alone, picking up the \textit{bowi} fruits. He was about to say, ``They left lots of good fruits on the ground when they left,'' when the vulture came to where he was.

 ``What are you doing?''

 ``What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm eating the fruits that they knocked on the ground.''

 ``I took a long time to make the fruits, and you destroyed them. See my place.''

 ``I don't want to see your place. I don't want to cry out with fear.''

 ``You won't cry out. It's the same as where we are standing here. Don't refuse. You should see it,'' he said.

 ``If you take me, I will yell.'' He sat there on the ground, refusing.

 The vulture put him on his back. He looked all around. There was a clearing. He took off with him in the clearing. \textit{Fofofo} \textit{fofofo}, his wings could be heard as he went off. The old man lay on the vulture's back. He took the old man. He disappeared with him into his hole in the sky.

 Their perch was very slippery, the perch of the vultures.

 ``Grandpa, sit down. Sit there. It's where we sit. It is wood.''

 He didn't say anything. He looked all around. He listened to the vultures talking. ``\textit{Hii} \textit{hii} \textit{hii} \textit{hii},'' the vultures said.

 ``You leave me alone.''

 ``They are asking you a question. `Is that something rotten over there?' they are saying,'' he said, the one who had taken him.

 ``No.''

 ``He says no.''

 The female spirit cut up the \textit{bahama} catfish. He brought a barb of the fish back.

 The vulture's mother called her, Nemeharaha. They used to say her name. Her name was Nemeharaha. She brought food for the old man, \textit{siraba} fish, in a ceramic pot. There is a ceramic pot in the sky. The sky has a side facing down.

 ``Nemeharaha, Nemeharaha,'' she said.

 ``What?'' she said.

 ``Give some food to the old man. He came here because he is hungry,'' she said.

 It was manioc mash. The pot\footnote{This kind of ceramic pot is shallow, like a large dish.} was full, with manioc mash in the bottom, and boiled fish on top.

 There are \textit{siraba} fish in the sky. The sky has a side facing down [like a ceramic dish].

 ``Don't give food to my grandfather [because it will make him sick]. I will eat the fish. My grandfather has eaten.''

 ``I won't eat your food. Let your food be,'' the old man said. ``I have already eaten.''

 The vulture ate her food. He ate her food, and then took the pot back.

 ``We ate the fish. We are going,'' he said.

 ``Go ahead. Take him.''

 The perch was slippery, and the old man was afraid.
``Grandfather, I will put you on my back again. I am taking you home.''

 So he took him back. ``Hold on tightly to my armbands. Keep your eyes closed. I'm about to take off,'' he said.

 He was carrying the \textit{bahama} barb, but his \textit{bahama} barb got lost.
He was ready. He opened his wings, and lifted off, and came down. He came down fast with the old man. It's the story about him. ``Whew.''

 The old man fell when the vulture landed with him. He turned around and faced him. The old man lay on the ground because of him.

 He was out of breath. He came home. The one who had been rough with him went away.

 ``He scared me.''

 ``He scared me, too,'' he said, the one who had been rough with him.

 ``My \textit{bahama} barb got lost,'' he said.

 ``Whew, I'm going home.''

 ``All right, go home.''

 The vulture went away. The old man went home. He had been treated rough.

 The old man went home. ``Whew, the fruits that you chopped down caused problems for me, and now I have come back. The spirit was rough with me, and he has gone away. I wanted you to see the \textit{bahama} barb, but it got lost, after you cut down the \textit{bowi} tree that caused problems for me.''

 Then they criticized him. ``You were left lying on the ground by yourself, and the spirit took you away.''

 ``I was about to come back. I was ready, and then the spirit surprised me,'' he said.

 He spoke, telling the story after coming back. ``The women brought boiled \textit{siraba} fish. The spirit wouldn't let me eat the boiled \textit{siraba} fish. It was rough with me. The boiled \textit{siraba} fish filled the pot,'' he said.
