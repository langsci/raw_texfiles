The story \textit{Siraba} was told by Yowao in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-siraba.mp3}.

Siraba was a teenage girl who went with her cross-cousin to get \textit{siro} fruits in the forest. There they encountered a spirit who impersonated Siraba's cousin's brother, who was supposed to marry Siraba. Siraba saw that it was a spirit, and the two girls managed to run away. But the spirit caught up with them later in the village. This time he succeeded in deceiving Siraba, and he took her away and spent the night with her. When she came home in the morning, she soon died.

The last part of the text briefly tells the story of how the Jarawaras were originally part of a larger group that came from upstream. The group were ferrying themselves across the Purus River, when the man who was ferrying them got tired and quit, leaving the group divided on the two sides of the river. The group that had been ferried decided to go on, and they became the present-day Jarawaras. The group that remained on the other side went back to where they came from.

Yowao's son Okomobi asks his father questions at several points, this is shown in the English translation.
