The story \textit{My father fought a cougar} was told by Siko in 1991. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-cougar.mp3}.

Siko's father, Botehefo, was attacked one day in the forest by a cougar. When this happened Botehefo was an adult, but the non-eyewitness tense that Siko uses indicates that this occurred before Siko was born. A cougar can kill a man, to be sure, but cougars are not as dangerous as jaguars. Siko's father struggled with the cougar and managed to make it run away. An indication of the stage of the contact of the Jarawaras with Brazilians is the fact that Siko's father had a rifle with him. Nowadays shotguns have replaced rifles.
