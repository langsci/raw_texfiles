\noindent He was planning to go after the Yimas. He hit with a stick on the buttress roots of a tree where there were wasps in a hole. They were hitting on the tree where the wasps were, and they were grabbing the wasps with their hands, \textit{tosi} wasps. They hit on the tree where the \textit{tosi} wasps were. They were grabbing the \textit{tosi} wasps with their hands. They ran out of wasps.
 
\noindent Then they went looking for other wasps, and they fought against those wasps, too, and they killed them. They did this so that they could fight against the Yimas. They killed wasps on two days, so they could fight against the Yimas.
 
\noindent ``The Yimas will die. Let's go see them.''
 
\noindent They had weapons, their weapons. They went after the Yimas, and waited for them as they were inside the longhouse. A Yima cried out when he was dreaming. Another man woke up. He shook his wife. He brought her outside. They came out. It was dark.
 
\noindent He quickly lay down on the ground, because the Yimas caught them by surprise. The Yima woman urinated on him. He was suffering, because he felt like speaking, as the Yima woman was urinating on him. She squatted, urinating on him.
 
\noindent Then they went back inside. They made the Yimas go back to sleep before dawn.
 
\noindent He went inside. He carried away the weapons of the Yimas, making many trips in and out. He piled up the weapons of the Yimas. He called to the others.
 
\noindent ``Let's go home [i.e., let's kill the Yimas quickly so we can go home],'' they said. They were going to attack the Yimas.
 
\noindent So that they could fight against the Yimas, he carried away the weapons, and piled them up at another place. Then they fought against the Yimas. He ran a Yima through with a spear as he was in the hammock with his wife.
 
\noindent ``Yima, I am going to fight you.''
 
\noindent The Yima woke up.
 
\noindent ``Yima, I'm going to fight you.''
 
\noindent \textit{Tiihii} [went the sound of the spear going into the Yima], and the Yima cried out.
 
\noindent They yelled, ``\textit{Hiihii}.''
 
\noindent The sound of him wounding the Yimas could be heard, as he fought against the Yimas. The sound of him fighting with Yimas could be heard, as he was killing the Yimas. He was killing the Yimas. They were killing the Yimas. They were throwing them in a pile. They killed a Yima woman. They killed Yimas.
 
\noindent They spoke. ``Let's go home. Let's go. There aren't any more Yimas. Let's not look anymore.''
 
\noindent ``Aren't there any others living here?''
 
\noindent ``Apparently there aren't any others living here. Let's go home.''
 
\noindent ``Yes.''
 
\noindent So they came back. They talked back home. ``The Yimas couldn't kill us, because I called the others to fight against them. They all died. We killed them,'' Saba said back at the village. Saba told the news back home. They spoke, and their voices could be heard.
 
\noindent Then they moved away to another place. They went and lived somewhere else, because they had killed people. They waited for the Yimas a long time.
 
\noindent They wanted to have a feast, so they invited each other. They invited the others. ``Yes, we will have a feast.'' They invited them, and they were ready.
 
\noindent ``You go on ahead. We will follow tomorrow.''
 
\noindent The next day they were ready to leave. ``Father, are you going to stay here?''
 
\noindent ``I will come later. I will come after you.''
 
\noindent ``Come quickly. Let's go there together. I will go. Take down the hammock. They called us to go,'' [he said to his wife]. ``We are going on ahead,'' [he said to his father].
 
\noindent ``Right, you go on ahead.''
 
\noindent They went on ahead, to participate in the feast. Their father came afterwards. Their father came behind. They went ahead. Soon they arrived.
 
\noindent Then they missed their father. It was late in the day, so he came back looking for his father. ``My father was going to come, but he didn't come.''
 
\noindent ``Did your father say he would come?''
 
\noindent ``Yes, my father was going to come, but he hasn't come.''
 
\noindent ``Go back to see him.''
 
\noindent ``I will go back to see my father.''
 
\noindent He came back after his father. He left his older brother behind. He came back.
 
\noindent The Yimas had tied up his father, and he came upon the signs of violence.
 
\noindent ``Someone has caught my father. There are signs of my father. So that's why he didn't come. There are signs of someone having tied up my father. I'm going back to tell the others about them.''
 
\noindent He went running back. ``Brother, this is why my father didn't come. Someone took my father away. Let's go back and look at my father,'' he said.
 
\noindent ``Right, someone has taken away my father.''
 
\noindent He called the others to go, who were sponsoring the feast. They stopped the feast. They came back. They came upon the signs of them. They looked around.
 
\noindent ``Someone took away my father. There is their trail going that way. Let's go look at them.''
 
\noindent He went. They went. Their weapons were all arrows. He went there. They followed their trail. They went after them. They heard their voices as they were talking. Then they stopped.
 
\noindent A Yima man came right facing where they were standing. He came to the water. He took off his breechcloth. He went to the water, and took out the manioc mash [that was in a basket in the water]. He came to the bank carrying the manioc mash. He took the manioc mash away. He set the basket of manioc mash down. He set the manioc mash down so that the mash would dry out, so it would be eaten with the one that they had brought.
 
\noindent He bathed. He finished bathing. He went, and they went behind him. He followed. He wasn't afraid. The others surrounded the longhouse. Two of them went in.
 
\noindent A child cried. It was his younger brother.
 
\noindent ``Where is my father?'' he said. ``I have come to get my father, who you brought here.''
 
\noindent ``Your father is lying there on the ground. Your father has not been touched. Your father is lying there,'' they said, the Yimas.
 
\noindent ``Unbind my father. I'm going to take my father home.''
 
\noindent So the Yimas unbound him. They also unbound the child. They also unbound the child's mother, who they had bound.
 
\noindent He continued to speak to them. The Yimas listened to him as they stood there. They stood listening to him. He spoke.
 
\noindent ``Take my father away. I'm going to finish listening to them.'' He wanted to listen to them, and he handed off his father.
 
\noindent They took his father away. Then he went back inside. His brother-in-law stayed outside, while he went inside.
 
\noindent ``Are you going to stay here? We are going to have a feast.''
 
\noindent ``Right,'' the Yimas said. ``We are living here.''
 
\noindent ``Live here.''
 
\noindent Then he took an arrow out of the sheath. He pulled out an arrow, and inserted the arrow pointing up. He pulled back on the arrow. ``I want to shoot an arrow at the ceiling of your longhouse.''
 
\noindent But he lowered the arrow and shot a Yima in the chest. He shot him from very close by, and he cried out.
 
\noindent They yelled. The Yima women ran away. The Yima women went out.
 
\noindent He was yelling as he was shooting them with arrows, as he and his brother-in-law were attacking them. The Yimas were rushing out. The others were shooting them with arrows, also the Yima women. He yelled out as he attacked them. He was attacking the Yimas. They were chasing the Yimas.
 
\noindent A pregnant Yima woman went running to the water, and went in the water. They shot one of the women in the sole of her foot. They shot her in the sole of her foot, and she died. The other woman didn't come to the surface. Long ago I saw the lake where she went into the water. It must still be there.
