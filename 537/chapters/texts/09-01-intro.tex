The story \textit{The jaguars ate the girls} was told by Siko in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-jaggirls.mp3}.

The Jarawaras tell many stories about encounters with jaguars in the forest. Most of them end with fatalities, but some narrate escapes from jaguars. In this story, about a group of girls, one girl escapes, but her friends are killed, because they failed to listen to her warning.
