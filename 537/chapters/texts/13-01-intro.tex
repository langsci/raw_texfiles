The story \textit{The Yimas} was told by Yowao in 1993. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-theyimas.mp3}.

In the stories of the Jarawaras, their most traditional enemies were the Yimas. Tradition says that they were close neighbors of the Jarawaras. Today the Jarawaras identify the Yimas with the Jumas, a Tupi-Guarani speaking group that formerly inhabited an area between Lábrea and Humaitá. The identification seems dubious to me, since the Jumas never crossed the Purus. Also, in the stories, the Jarawaras and Yimas converse with each other, indicating they probably spoke closely related languages.

In this text, two encounters with the Yimas are narrated. The first involves Saba and his companions, who attacked a Yima village. In the second episode, a man leaves his parents alone in their village when the rest of the people go to another village for a feast. The couple are supposed to come to the feast later, but they are captured by Yimas and taken to the Yima village. Their son discovers what has happened, and he and his companions go to the Yima village to rescue their relatives. They succeed, and kill many Yimas in the attack.
