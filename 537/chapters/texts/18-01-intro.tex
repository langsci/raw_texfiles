The story \textit{My father and his familiar spirit} was told by Yowao in 1994. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-fatherspirit.mp3}.

Yowao's father told him about a violent encounter he and his familiar spirit had with another spirit that wanted to kill them. His familiar spirit was victorious, and Yowao's father said he felt sad as he watched the other spirit dying.

I have left off the transcription of the last few minutes of the recording, in which Yowao spoke about various other subjects after he finished the story.
