The story \textit{The old man who went up in the sky} was told by Yowao in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-oldmansky.mp3}.

Many of Yowao's stories are about spirits, as this one is. Spirits often turn themselves into animals; in this story they are king vultures. Individual spirits which the Jarawaras contacted had personal names, and a young female spirit's name is recorded in this story.
