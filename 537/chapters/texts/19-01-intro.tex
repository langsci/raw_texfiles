The story \textit{A pair of monsters} was told by Yowao in 1994. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-pairmonsters.mp3}.

This is actually two stories, the main one being about a pair of monsters. Yowao's father encountered the pair in the forest, and he killed the female first, and then the male, with his rifle. Yowao indicates that he was alive when this happened. He and his friends wanted to go look at the monsters, but the others would not let them.

The second story is shorter, and it is about a spirit that Yowao's father encountered, which was crying, apparently because it was cold. Other spirits came and killed it and carried it off to eat it, while Yowao's father watched. The other spirits undoubtedly were Yowao's father's familiar spirits, who had come to deliver him from the crying spirit.
