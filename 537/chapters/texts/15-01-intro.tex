The story \textit{Kamabira} was told by Yowao in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-kamabira.mp3}.

The events of this story happened during the lifetime of Yowao's (and Siko's) grandfather, probably before Yowao's father was born. A man named Kamabira became sick after he ate meat of a woolly monkey that still had blood in it, and he started acting strangely. After a short time he died. His companions concluded that he had been attacked by a \textit{maka} monster, which had taken the form of a woolly monkey.

Siko also told a version of this story. The details are similar, except that in his version, Kamabira was attacked when he killed some howler monkeys with his blowgun. The Jarawaras don't consider howlers very good for food. It was concluded that the howlers were \textit{maka} monsters in disguise.
