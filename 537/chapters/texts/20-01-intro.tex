The story \textit{White-lipped Peccaries and a Jaguar} was told by Yowao in 1994. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/yowao-peccaryjaguar.mp3}.

This is the only story in this volume in which the author was a main participant in the events. Some villagers saw signs of white-lipped peccaries as they were in the forest, and so when they came home, and Yowao went out the next day after the peccaries. White-lipped peccaries move through the forest in large bands, and they are dangerous. Yowao found the band of peccaries, and killed several. He brought one back, and went out again the next day with a group of men to bring the rest of the dead peccaries back to the village. They came across the band again, and this time there was a jaguar after the peccaries, making them even more excited and noisy.
