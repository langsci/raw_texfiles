The story \textit{The poison root song} was told by Siko in 1987. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-poisonroot.mp3}.

This story references the time when Siko's father was a young boy. It is about a man named Aifa, who composed songs that were sung at the feast they would have when they poisoned fish in the streams. This is still one of the ways the Jarawaras fish today, but without the singing and dancing. In the dry season when the water level is low, they put mashed roots of the \textit{kona} plant in the stream, to slow down the fish and make it easier to spear them. The \textit{kona} is a cultivated plant, and the Jarawaras find it in the secondary forest at the locations of old abandoned villages.
