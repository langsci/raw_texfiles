The story \textit{The caimans killed the man} was told by Siko in 1992. The corresponding audio file can be downloaded at: \url{https://www.silbrazil.org/sites/brazil/files/siko-gatorman.mp3}.

In this tragedy, a young woman is about to go out hunting with her husband. She waits while he puts poison on the points of his arrows and blowgun darts. She tires of waiting, though, and leaves to go fishing by herself. When she gets back with her catch, her husband has taken and eaten some of the tapioca that she had prepared, and she is upset. In her anger she insults him, and he withdraws to sulk in his hammock, refusing to eat. The next morning he leaves by himself to go after a river turtle. The other men go after him, and they go hunting together. After killing some monkeys, he goes after a turtle. But the turtle is very large, and it carries him from the beach into the water, where he is killed and eaten by caimans. The man's brother-in-law, who is the older brother of his wife, wants to kill his sister when he gets back to the village, but the others restrain him.
