\noindent The \textit{kose mati} monster. The teenager was trained as a shaman. They trained him as a shaman. They trained him over a period of time, and then they were done with him. He was walking around normally again.

\noindent He went hunting.

\noindent ``Father, should I go hunting?''

\noindent ``Go hunting. Go.''

\noindent His father ordered him, and he went. They had trained him as a shaman, and he had returned to normal. He went out into the forest, carrying a blowgun on his shoulder.

\noindent A curassow was calling. ``\textit{Hho} \textit{hho} \textit{hohooo} \textit{ho}.''

\noindent ``I'm going to shoot the curassow with a dart.''

\noindent He went on to shoot the curassow. There was a kapok tree. There was a \textit{kose mati} monster hiding in the buttress roots of the kapok tree,\footnote{The kapok trees in the Jarawara area, which grow in the seasonally flooded forest, are the largest trees in the region (at least they were, but all the largest ones have been logged now). They are very thick and very high, and have huge buttress roots.} making the sound of a curassow calling. It was looking up. ``\textit{Hho} \textit{hho} \textit{hohooo} \textit{o}.''

\noindent He was coming. He came with the blowgun in his hand.

\noindent ``The curassow called there.''

\noindent He moved over to a different position, and the monster attacked him. It attacked, and caught him. He got free, and ran away with it. It caught him again. It brought him back.

\noindent It picked up its basket. It put him in the basket, and tied him in. He didn't make a fuss.

\noindent ``Whew, I'm going to throw him in the water.''

\noindent It went up into the kapok tree. It went up the kapok tree. ``\textit{Ho-o}, \textit{ho-o}, \textit{ho-o}.'' It was carrying him attached by its head.

\noindent It arrived up high with him. At the place where there was a branch in the kapok tree, it went around.

\noindent There was a lake. The kapok tree was on the edge of a lake. It went up the kapok tree, and took him out along a straight limb of the kapok tree, on top of the limb. It went carrying him in the basket.

\noindent ``All right, I will throw him in the water with the basket.''

\noindent It swung him back and forth, and threw him. Instead of landing in the water, he went back. He went back, and landed there.\footnote{The man's shamanic powers kept him from falling in the water.}

\noindent ``Humph, I wanted him to go in the water, wait.''

\noindent It went down. It came back on the branch. It went down through an open place in the branches, \textit{karii}, \textit{beo}. It got him again.

\noindent ``Help.''

\noindent ``Hey, don't call.''

\noindent ``There is no one to help me, help!''\footnote{The man was calling for his familiar spirits to rescue him.}

\noindent But he kept on calling out. Because he stubbornly kept on calling out, it defecated on his face. His face had diarrhea on it. His face had feces on it. It defecated on his face.

\noindent It took him back up in the basket. ``\textit{Ho-o}, \textit{ho-o}, \textit{ho-o}, \textit{ho-o}.'' Its voice could be heard as it went back up. It was close. ``Whew.'' It straightened the basket so it would not fall.

\noindent It went along the limb with him. It planned against him. It swung him back and forth, and threw him.

\noindent But he went back, even though the monster thought he was going to go in the water. He almost touched the surface of the water as he went back. He landed back there.

\noindent ``\textit{Aa}, I wanted him to go in the water. He is naughty. I wanted him to drown.''

\noindent It came back on the limb, and went down. It went down, \textit{baasa}, \textit{beo}.

\noindent He called out.

\noindent ``He is calling out.''

\noindent ``There is no one to help me, help!''

\noindent ``Don't call out.''

\noindent It came and got him. It defecated on his face. Because he said he wouldn't stop calling out, it defecated diarrhea on his face. It took him back up.

\noindent ``Oof, hoo, he should have gone into the water. Why didn't he? What did he do?''

\noindent It took him back up. It went back up. It got close to the top.

\noindent Then it took him out on the limb. It took him out on the limb again.

\noindent When it arrived, it swung him back and forth. \textit{Koro}, he went out. He didn't fall in the water, but went along the surface, \textit{sissss}, \textit{sssi}. He landed and sat again where the kapok tree was.

\noindent ``Aa, there he goes again.''

\noindent It came back along the branch again, and came down again.

\noindent The spirits heard something. The spirit heard something. There were two of them that heard something.

\noindent ``The monster threw someone in something who was calling, I saw him. There, it took him up again. Wait, don't do anything yet. Let's watch him.''

\noindent It took him out on the limb.

\noindent ``Look at him.''

\noindent It threw him again. He didn't fall into the water, but went back again, \textit{isissss}. He landed upright.

\noindent ``I told you. The monster threw someone in something.''

\noindent It jumped down. They saw it coming down. Two spears would stand right where it came down.

\noindent The two of them came.

\noindent ``The monster threw someone in something,'' they said.

\noindent ``Here.'' It put him on its back again in the basket. It went up with him. It took him up.

\noindent The two of them appeared. They stuck two spears in the ground. They were standing upright. The spears were pointing up, two together. The points were together. They stuck the two spears in the ground. The two spirits stood there.

\noindent It went and took him out on the limb.

\noindent ``I want him to go into the water now.''

\noindent It swung him back and forth. \textit{Koro}, it thought he would go into the water, but he came back to the same place. He went over the water, \textit{sisss}, and arrived again.

\noindent ``\textit{Aa}, there he goes again.''

\noindent It came back on the limb. The two spears were standing at the place where he always landed. The two spears were upright.

\noindent It dropped, and when it was going to hit the ground, the spears went through it, and it cried out. ``\textit{Aya}, \textit{aya}, \textit{aya}.''

\noindent It went right down to the hilts of the spears, because it fell hard. It cried out. They rushed it, and finished it off. They killed it. It died. When it died, they went and got him, and brought him back.

\noindent ``Hey, what happened to you? Did it capture you?''

\noindent ``It captured me. It was there on the ground. It threw me from where it was. It was there making the call of a curassow. I didn't see it, and it captured me from behind. There it is, lying on the ground.''

\noindent ``Look at it. Look at it lying there. The \textit{kose mati} is huge. We will eat it.''

\noindent Then they untied him. They untied the basket over his face. They let him out.

\noindent ``Go take a bath. You smell bad. It defecated on you.''

\noindent He went to the water to bathe. He bathed. When he finished bathing, he came onto the shore. ``Hoo, you saved me.''

\noindent ``We heard you calling. When you called, we heard you calling, and for this reason we came and found you. We found you, and saved you. It would have eaten you. It would have killed you. We saved you. You have escaped, now go home. Go home. We will take it away. We will eat it.''

\noindent ``You eat it. It captured me. I didn't see it. It captured me from behind.''

\noindent Then the two of them went away. After he left, they left. They put it on their shoulders, and went, and ate it.

\noindent ``Whew, it threw the man, and we killed it, and we are bringing it,'' they said.

\noindent They ate it.

\noindent He arrived back.

\noindent ``Whew, a spirit captured me to throw me, and I have come back.''

\noindent ``You were not wary,'' his father said. ``It must have been a \textit{kose mati}.''

\noindent ``The monster was standing among the buttress roots of a kapok tree, looking up and calling like a curassow. I was looking at it, and when I changed my position, it captured me from behind.''

\noindent ``It must have been a \textit{kose mati}. You shouldn't go to the flooded forest. The monster is there in the flooded forest. People used to say long ago that it is in the flooded forest, and now it captured you.''

\noindent ``It captured me, and threw me. Two spirits saved me, and then went away. You wouldn't have seen me anymore. It tied me in a basket. It defecated on my face, because it said I was calling out. There were feces on my face. It took me back up again in the tree, and threw me, so I would go into the water. It wanted me to drown. It wanted me to go in the water, but I couldn't go in the water. Because I couldn't go in the water, I survived. They heard me calling, and came after me. Because of them the monster cried out, as I was in the basket on the edge of the lake. They said they were spirits of the \textit{kosi} palm. The two \textit{kosi} spirits saved me, and then went away. I came back here, and appeared. You wouldn't have seen me anymore. I would have died in the depths of the water. I would have died in the water.''
